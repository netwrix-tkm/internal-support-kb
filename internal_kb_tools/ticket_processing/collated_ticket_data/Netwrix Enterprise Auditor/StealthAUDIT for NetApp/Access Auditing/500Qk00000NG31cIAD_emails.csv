This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:

What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server? Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinueIf my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs.  Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email. Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? 

To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally. 
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host. 
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal. 

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error. 
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] System.OutOfMemoryException while running FSAA System Scan [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0NG31c:ref ]


Hello All-State Team,

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan.
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it!

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:

  1.  What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
  2.  Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
  3.  Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
[cid:image001.png@01DB9CCB.0C6FF6C0]

  1.  If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
  2.  Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server
  3.  Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email.
[cid:image004.png@01DB9CCB.AEBAE660]

  1.  Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? – Not sure

To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally.
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host.
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal.

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error.
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export.

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan.
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it!

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:

  1.  What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? - On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
  2.  Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
  3.  Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
[cid:image001.png@01DB9CCF.E08A1270]

  1.  If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? - Total = 120,
  2.  Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. - Yes running Local Server
  3.  Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email.
[cid:image004.png@01DB9CCF.E08A1270]

  1.  Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? - Not sure

To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally.
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host.
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal.

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error.
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export.

From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred:

[image]

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? 

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. 
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results?

Hello Sean, Alison,

Thank you for uploading the logs.

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:

[cid:image001.png@01DB9D78.C454CDD0]

Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:

[cid:image002.png@01DB9D78.C454CDD0]


To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed.
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server. 
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it 

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server. 
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison, 

Thank you for uploading the logs. 

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:





To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Hello All-State Team, 

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:


	What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
	Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
	Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue





	If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
	Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server
	Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email. 





	Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? –  Not sure


To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally. 
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host. 
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal. 

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error. 
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export. 



 

From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 

 

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply. 
Thank you!

Hello All-State Team,

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred. 
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server? 

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads?

Hello Sean, Alison, 

Thank you for uploading the logs. 

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:





To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Hello All-State Team, 

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:


	What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
	Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
	Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue





	If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
	Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server
	Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email. 





	Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? –  Not sure


To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally. 
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host. 
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal. 

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error. 
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export. 



 

From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 

 

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply. 
Thank you!

Hi Artem,
I have attached the logs to the portal. We have not commenced the 5 thread scans just yet as another scan was running but we will do once it completes to verify RAM, etc.

Hi Alison,

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred.
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server?

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads?

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison,

Thank you for the prompt reply.

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server.
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server.
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan. 

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run. 
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs. 

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news. 

Thank you!

Hi Alison, 

Thank you for the prompt reply. 

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server.

Hello Sean, Alison, 

Thank you for uploading the logs. 

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:





To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Artem Naskal

Hello All-State Team, 

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:


	What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
	Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
	Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue





	If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
	Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server
	Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email. 





	Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? –  Not sure


To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally. 
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host. 
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal. 

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error. 
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export. 



 

From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 

 

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply. 
Thank you!

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception. 

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception. 

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan. 

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan. 

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run. 
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs. 

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news. 

Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Alison, 

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred. 
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server? 

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison, 

Thank you for the prompt reply. 

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server. 
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it 

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server. 
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello All-State Team, 

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:


	What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
	Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24

	If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
	Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Hi Alison, 

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred. 
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server? 

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison, 

Thank you for the prompt reply. 

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server. 
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it 

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server. 
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison, 

Thank you for uploading the logs. 

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:





To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] System.OutOfMemoryException while running FSAA System Scan [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0NG31c:ref ]



 

Hello All-State Team, 

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:


	What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
	Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
	Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue





	If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
	Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server
	Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email. 





	Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? –  Not sure


To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally. 
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host. 
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal. 

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error. 
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export. 



 

From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 

 

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply. 
Thank you!

Hi Artem,

I've been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers.
It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job
[cid:image001.png@01DBA7C2.3EA38740]

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Alison, Sean,

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception.

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception.

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=KMb7XD3VmphxOrcHrsnVq9r.oDvadTfVkFL5MWN8PIQ-Z&MeetingID=xLJooGFlXuuCHTuDIZftOTXjkpHNDMeLUC7Dqs.FckY-Z

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan.

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run.
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs.

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news.

Thank you!

Artem Naskal

Hi Alison,

Thank you for the prompt reply.

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872

Subject: [EXTERNAL] System.OutOfMemoryException while running FSAA System Scan [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0NG31c:ref ]


Hello All-State Team,

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan.
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it!

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:

  1.  What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? - On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
  2.  Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
  3.  Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
[cid:image006.png@01DBA7C2.3EA38740]

  1.  If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? - Total = 120,
  2.  Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. - Yes running Local Server
  3.  Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email.
[cid:image005.png@01DBA7C2.3EA38740]

  1.  Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? - Not sure

To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally.
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host.
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal.

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error.
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export.

[image]



From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred:

[image]

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

The ""2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups"" job is located in another folder in the File System solution group.
This means that the FSAA system scan that was failing with ""System Out Of Memory"" exception has completed as it sits higher in the job order. 

Could you open the File System > 0.Collection group and check if FSAA system scan completed successfully and let me know?

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers. 

It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job 



 

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Alison, Sean, 

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception. 

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception. 

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan. 

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=KMb7XD3VmphxOrcHrsnVq9r.oDvadTfVkFL5MWN8PIQ-Z&MeetingID=xLJooGFlXuuCHTuDIZftOTXjkpHNDMeLUC7Dqs.FckY-Z

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan. 

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run. 
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs. 

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news. 

Thank you!

Hi Artem,

I have attached the logs to the portal. We have not commenced the 5 thread scans just yet as another scan was running but we will do once it completes to verify RAM, etc.

 

Thank you,

Hi Alison, 

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred. 
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server? 

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison, 

Thank you for the prompt reply. 

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server. 
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it 

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server. 
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison, 

Thank you for uploading the logs. 

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:





To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Artem Naskal

Hi Artem,

I've checked, and yes the jobs for the 0.Collection group all completed on the 29th March.

So I'm guessing the remaining part of the scans are not related to the previous issue.

I'm going to stop the scan so the NAS and Win1 jobs can be re-run to validate the ""out of memory' fix. No point delaying that any further.
The remaining subfolder scans can be investigated at another time.

Sean

We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Alison, Sean,

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception.

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception.

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan.

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run.
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs.

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news.

Thank you!

Hi Artem,
I have attached the logs to the portal. We have not commenced the 5 thread scans just yet as another scan was running but we will do once it completes to verify RAM, etc.

Thank you,

Hi Alison,

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred.
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server?

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads?

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison,

Thank you for the prompt reply.

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server.
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server.
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison,

Thank you for uploading the logs.

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:

[cid:image002.png@01DBA7D1.5587D3D0]

Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:

[cid:image003.png@01DBA7D1.5587D3D0]


To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Hello All-State Team,

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan.
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it!

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:

  1.  What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? - On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
  2.  Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
  3.  Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
[cid:image006.png@01DBA7D1.5587D3D0]

  1.  If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? - Total = 120,
  2.  Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. - Yes running Local Server
  3.  Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email.
[cid:image005.png@01DBA7D1.5587D3D0]

  1.  Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? - Not sure

To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally.
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host.
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal.

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error.
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export.

[image]



From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred:

[image]

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

Thank you for the follow up.

Yes, the Out Of Memory issue was affecting the FSAA system scan. Job`s from sub folders are analysis tasks and are not related to Data Collection.

Would you like to keep ticket open until you have results for the NAS and Win1 hosts?

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve checked, and yes the jobs for the 0.Collection group all completed on the 29th March.

 

So I’m guessing the remaining part of the scans are not related to the previous issue.

 

I’m going to stop the scan so the NAS and Win1 jobs can be re-run to validate the “out of memory’ fix. No point delaying that any further.

The remaining subfolder scans can be investigated at another time.

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

The ""2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups"" job is located in another folder in the File System solution group.
This means that the FSAA system scan that was failing with ""System Out Of Memory"" exception has completed as it sits higher in the job order. 

Could you open the File System > 0.Collection group and check if FSAA system scan completed successfully and let me know?

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers. 

It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job 



 

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

I have attached the logs to the portal. We have not commenced the 5 thread scans just yet as another scan was running but we will do once it completes to verify RAM, etc.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Alison, 

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred. 
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server? 

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison, 

Thank you for the prompt reply. 

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server. 
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it 

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server. 
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison, 

Thank you for uploading the logs. 

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:





To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Artem Naskal

Hello All-State Team, 

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:


	What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
	Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
	Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue





	If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
	Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server
	Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email. 





	Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? –  Not sure


To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally. 
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host. 
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal. 

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error. 
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export. 



 

From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 

 

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply. 
Thank you!

Hi Artem,

Yes, let's keep the ticket opened until those have completed.
The re-run of the Win1 scan completed and I'm getting the NAS run now.

Hi Sean,

Thank you for the follow up.

Yes, the Out Of Memory issue was affecting the FSAA system scan. Job`s from sub folders are analysis tasks and are not related to Data Collection.

Would you like to keep ticket open until you have results for the NAS and Win1 hosts?

Hi Artem,

I've checked, and yes the jobs for the 0.Collection group all completed on the 29th March.

So I'm guessing the remaining part of the scans are not related to the previous issue.

I'm going to stop the scan so the NAS and Win1 jobs can be re-run to validate the ""out of memory' fix. No point delaying that any further.
The remaining subfolder scans can be investigated at another time.

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

The ""2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups"" job is located in another folder in the File System solution group.
This means that the FSAA system scan that was failing with ""System Out Of Memory"" exception has completed as it sits higher in the job order.

Could you open the File System > 0.Collection group and check if FSAA system scan completed successfully and let me know?

Hi Artem,

I've been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers.
It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job
[cid:image001.png@01DBA875.AF054600]

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Alison, Sean,

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception.

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception.

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=KMb7XD3VmphxOrcHrsnVq9r.oDvadTfVkFL5MWN8PIQ-Z&MeetingID=xLJooGFlXuuCHTuDIZftOTXjkpHNDMeLUC7Dqs.FckY-Z

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan.

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run.
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs.

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news.

Thank you!

Hi Alison,

Thank you for the prompt reply.

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server.
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server.
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison,

Thank you for uploading the logs.

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:

[cid:image002.png@01DBA875.AF054600]

Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:

[cid:image003.png@01DBA875.AF054600]


To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] System.OutOfMemoryException while running FSAA System Scan [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0NG31c:ref ]


Hello All-State Team,

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan.
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it!

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:

  1.  What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? - On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
  2.  Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
  3.  Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
[cid:image006.png@01DBA875.AF054600]

  1.  If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? - Total = 120,
  2.  Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. - Yes running Local Server
  3.  Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email.
[cid:image005.png@01DBA875.AF054600]

  1.  Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? - Not sure

To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally.
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host.
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal.

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error.
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export.

[image]



From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred:

[image]

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

Hi Artem,

 

Yes, let’s keep the ticket opened until those have completed.

The re-run of the Win1 scan completed and I’m getting the NAS run now.

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for the follow up.

Yes, the Out Of Memory issue was affecting the FSAA system scan. Job`s from sub folders are analysis tasks and are not related to Data Collection.

Would you like to keep ticket open until you have results for the NAS and Win1 hosts?

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve checked, and yes the jobs for the 0.Collection group all completed on the 29th March.

 

So I’m guessing the remaining part of the scans are not related to the previous issue.

 

I’m going to stop the scan so the NAS and Win1 jobs can be re-run to validate the “out of memory’ fix. No point delaying that any further.

The remaining subfolder scans can be investigated at another time.

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

The ""2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups"" job is located in another folder in the File System solution group.
This means that the FSAA system scan that was failing with ""System Out Of Memory"" exception has completed as it sits higher in the job order. 

Could you open the File System > 0.Collection group and check if FSAA system scan completed successfully and let me know?

Best regards,

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers. 

It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job 



 

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Alison, Sean, 

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception. 

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception. 

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan. 

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=KMb7XD3VmphxOrcHrsnVq9r.oDvadTfVkFL5MWN8PIQ-Z&MeetingID=xLJooGFlXuuCHTuDIZftOTXjkpHNDMeLUC7Dqs.FckY-Z

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan. 

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run. 
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs. 

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news. 

Thank you!

Hi Artem,

I have attached the logs to the portal. We have not commenced the 5 thread scans just yet as another scan was running but we will do once it completes to verify RAM, etc.

Hi Alison, 

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred. 
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server? 

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison, 

Thank you for the prompt reply. 

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server. 
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it 

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server. 
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison, 

Thank you for uploading the logs. 

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:





To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] System.OutOfMemoryException while running FSAA System Scan [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0NG31c:ref ]



 

Hello All-State Team, 

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:


	What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
	Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
	Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue





	If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
	Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server
	Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email. 





	Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? –  Not sure


To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally. 
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host. 
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal. 

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error. 
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export. 



 

From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 

 

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply. 
Thank you!

Hi Artem,

We're down to the 6 remaining NAS servers of the scan
[cid:image001.png@01DBAA1C.BF7147C0]

These are the largest and do usually take a while for the scan to complete on.

I'll keep you posted if and when these complete.

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Artem,

Yes, let's keep the ticket opened until those have completed.
The re-run of the Win1 scan completed and I'm getting the NAS run now.

Hi Sean,

Thank you for the follow up.

Yes, the Out Of Memory issue was affecting the FSAA system scan. Job`s from sub folders are analysis tasks and are not related to Data Collection.

Would you like to keep ticket open until you have results for the NAS and Win1 hosts?

Hi Artem,

I've checked, and yes the jobs for the 0.Collection group all completed on the 29th March.

So I'm guessing the remaining part of the scans are not related to the previous issue.

I'm going to stop the scan so the NAS and Win1 jobs can be re-run to validate the ""out of memory' fix. No point delaying that any further.
The remaining subfolder scans can be investigated at another time.

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

The ""2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups"" job is located in another folder in the File System solution group.
This means that the FSAA system scan that was failing with ""System Out Of Memory"" exception has completed as it sits higher in the job order.

Could you open the File System > 0.Collection group and check if FSAA system scan completed successfully and let me know?

Hi Artem,

I've been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers.
It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job
[cid:image002.png@01DBAA1C.BF7147C0]

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Alison, Sean,

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception.

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception.

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=KMb7XD3VmphxOrcHrsnVq9r.oDvadTfVkFL5MWN8PIQ-Z&MeetingID=xLJooGFlXuuCHTuDIZftOTXjkpHNDMeLUC7Dqs.FckY-Z

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan.

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run.
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs.

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news.

Thank you!

Hi Alison,

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred.
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server?

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads?

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison,

Thank you for the prompt reply.

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server.
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server.
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison,

Thank you for uploading the logs.

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:

[cid:image003.png@01DBAA1C.BF7147C0]

Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:

[cid:image004.png@01DBAA1C.BF7147C0]


To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Hello All-State Team,

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan.
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it!

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:

  1.  What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? - On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
  2.  Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
  3.  Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
[cid:image007.png@01DBAA1C.BF7147C0]

  1.  If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? - Total = 120,
  2.  Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. - Yes running Local Server
  3.  Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email.
[cid:image006.png@01DBAA1C.BF7147C0]

  1.  Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? - Not sure

To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally.
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host.
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal.

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error.
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export.

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply.

Hi Artem,

 

We’re down to the 6 remaining NAS servers of the scan 



 

These are the largest and do usually take a while for the scan to complete on.

 

I’ll keep you posted if and when these complete.

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Artem,

 

Yes, let’s keep the ticket opened until those have completed.

The re-run of the Win1 scan completed and I’m getting the NAS run now.

 


Thanks,

Hi Sean,

Thank you for the follow up.

Yes, the Out Of Memory issue was affecting the FSAA system scan. Job`s from sub folders are analysis tasks and are not related to Data Collection.

Would you like to keep ticket open until you have results for the NAS and Win1 hosts?

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve checked, and yes the jobs for the 0.Collection group all completed on the 29th March.

 

So I’m guessing the remaining part of the scans are not related to the previous issue.

 

I’m going to stop the scan so the NAS and Win1 jobs can be re-run to validate the “out of memory’ fix. No point delaying that any further.

The remaining subfolder scans can be investigated at another time.

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

The ""2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups"" job is located in another folder in the File System solution group.
This means that the FSAA system scan that was failing with ""System Out Of Memory"" exception has completed as it sits higher in the job order. 

Could you open the File System > 0.Collection group and check if FSAA system scan completed successfully and let me know?

Best regards,

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers. 

It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job 



 

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Hi Alison, Sean, 

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception. 

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception. 

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan. 

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=KMb7XD3VmphxOrcHrsnVq9r.oDvadTfVkFL5MWN8PIQ-Z&MeetingID=xLJooGFlXuuCHTuDIZftOTXjkpHNDMeLUC7Dqs.FckY-Z

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan. 

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run. 
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs. 

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news. 

Thank you!

Hi Alison, 

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred. 
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server? 

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison, 

Thank you for the prompt reply. 

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server. 
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it 

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server. 
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison, 

Thank you for uploading the logs. 

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:





To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Hello All-State Team, 

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:


	What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
	Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
	Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue





	If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
	Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server
	Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email. 





	Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? –  Not sure


To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally. 
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host. 
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal. 

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error. 
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export. 



 

From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 

 

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply. 
Thank you!

Hi Artem,

We're down to the 6 remaining NAS servers of the scan
[cid:image001.png@01DBAD65.9F8FDFB0]

These are the largest and do usually take a while for the scan to complete on.

I'll keep you posted if and when these complete.

Thanks,

Hi Sean,

Thank you for the follow up.

Yes, the Out Of Memory issue was affecting the FSAA system scan. Job`s from sub folders are analysis tasks and are not related to Data Collection.

Would you like to keep ticket open until you have results for the NAS and Win1 hosts?

Hi Artem,

I've checked, and yes the jobs for the 0.Collection group all completed on the 29th March.

So I'm guessing the remaining part of the scans are not related to the previous issue.

I'm going to stop the scan so the NAS and Win1 jobs can be re-run to validate the ""out of memory' fix. No point delaying that any further.
The remaining subfolder scans can be investigated at another time.

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

The ""2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups"" job is located in another folder in the File System solution group.
This means that the FSAA system scan that was failing with ""System Out Of Memory"" exception has completed as it sits higher in the job order.

Could you open the File System > 0.Collection group and check if FSAA system scan completed successfully and let me know?

Hi Artem,

I've been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers.
It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job
[cid:image002.png@01DBAD65.9F8FDFB0]

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Alison, Sean,

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception.

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception.

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=KMb7XD3VmphxOrcHrsnVq9r.oDvadTfVkFL5MWN8PIQ-Z&MeetingID=xLJooGFlXuuCHTuDIZftOTXjkpHNDMeLUC7Dqs.FckY-Z

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan.

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run.
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs.

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news.

Thank you!

Hi Alison,

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred.
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server?

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads?

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison,

Thank you for the prompt reply.

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server.
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server.
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison,

Thank you for uploading the logs.

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:

[cid:image003.png@01DBAD65.9F8FDFB0]

Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:

[cid:image004.png@01DBAD65.9F8FDFB0]


To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Hello All-State Team,

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan.
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it!

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:

  1.  What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? - On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
  2.  Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
  3.  Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
[cid:image007.png@01DBAD65.9F8FDFB0]

  1.  If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? - Total = 120,
  2.  Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. - Yes running Local Server
  3.  Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email.
[cid:image006.png@01DBAD65.9F8FDFB0]

  1.  Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? - Not sure

To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally.
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host.
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal.

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error.
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export.

Hi Artem,

 

We’re down to the 6 remaining NAS servers of the scan 



 

These are the largest and do usually take a while for the scan to complete on.

 

I’ll keep you posted if and when these complete.

 


Thanks,

Hi Artem,

 

Yes, let’s keep the ticket opened until those have completed.

The re-run of the Win1 scan completed and I’m getting the NAS run now.

 


Thanks,

Hi Sean,

Thank you for the follow up.

Yes, the Out Of Memory issue was affecting the FSAA system scan. Job`s from sub folders are analysis tasks and are not related to Data Collection.

Would you like to keep ticket open until you have results for the NAS and Win1 hosts?

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve checked, and yes the jobs for the 0.Collection group all completed on the 29th March.

 

So I’m guessing the remaining part of the scans are not related to the previous issue.

 

I’m going to stop the scan so the NAS and Win1 jobs can be re-run to validate the “out of memory’ fix. No point delaying that any further.

The remaining subfolder scans can be investigated at another time.

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

The ""2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups"" job is located in another folder in the File System solution group.
This means that the FSAA system scan that was failing with ""System Out Of Memory"" exception has completed as it sits higher in the job order. 

Could you open the File System > 0.Collection group and check if FSAA system scan completed successfully and let me know?

Best regards,

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers. 

It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job 



 

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Alison, Sean, 

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception. 

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception. 

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan. 

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=KMb7XD3VmphxOrcHrsnVq9r.oDvadTfVkFL5MWN8PIQ-Z&MeetingID=xLJooGFlXuuCHTuDIZftOTXjkpHNDMeLUC7Dqs.FckY-Z

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan. 

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run. 
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs. 

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news. 

Thank you!

Hi Artem,

I have attached the logs to the portal. We have not commenced the 5 thread scans just yet as another scan was running but we will do once it completes to verify RAM, etc.

 

Thank you,

Hi Alison, 

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred. 
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server? 

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison, 

Thank you for the prompt reply. 

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server. 
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it 

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server. 
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison, 

Thank you for uploading the logs. 

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:





To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Artem Naskal

Hello All-State Team, 

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:


	What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
	Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
	Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue





	If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
	Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server
	Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email. 





	Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? –  Not sure


To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally. 
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host. 
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal. 

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error. 
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export. 



 

From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 

 

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply. 
Thank you!

Hi Artem,

We're down to the 6 remaining NAS servers of the scan
[cid:image002.png@01DBADEF.AAAB1790]

These are the largest and do usually take a while for the scan to complete on.

I'll keep you posted if and when these complete.

Hi Sean,

Thank you for the follow up.

Yes, the Out Of Memory issue was affecting the FSAA system scan. Job`s from sub folders are analysis tasks and are not related to Data Collection.

Would you like to keep ticket open until you have results for the NAS and Win1 hosts?

Hi Artem,

I've checked, and yes the jobs for the 0.Collection group all completed on the 29th March.

So I'm guessing the remaining part of the scans are not related to the previous issue.

I'm going to stop the scan so the NAS and Win1 jobs can be re-run to validate the ""out of memory' fix. No point delaying that any further.
The remaining subfolder scans can be investigated at another time.

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

The ""2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups"" job is located in another folder in the File System solution group.
This means that the FSAA system scan that was failing with ""System Out Of Memory"" exception has completed as it sits higher in the job order.

Could you open the File System > 0.Collection group and check if FSAA system scan completed successfully and let me know?

Hi Artem,

I've been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers.
It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job
[cid:image003.png@01DBADEF.AAAB1790]

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Alison, Sean,

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception.

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception.

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=KMb7XD3VmphxOrcHrsnVq9r.oDvadTfVkFL5MWN8PIQ-Z&MeetingID=xLJooGFlXuuCHTuDIZftOTXjkpHNDMeLUC7Dqs.FckY-Z

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan.

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run.
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs.

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news.

Thank you!

I have attached the logs to the portal. We have not commenced the 5 thread scans just yet as another scan was running but we will do once it completes to verify RAM, etc.

Thank you,

Hi Alison,

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred.
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server?

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads?

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison,

Thank you for the prompt reply.

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server.
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server.
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison,

Thank you for uploading the logs.

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:

[cid:image004.png@01DBADEF.AAAB1790]

Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:

[cid:image005.png@01DBADEF.AAAB1790]


To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Hello All-State Team,

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan.
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it!

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:

  1.  What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? - On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
  2.  Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
  3.  Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
[cid:image008.png@01DBADEF.AAAB1790]

  1.  If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? - Total = 120,
  2.  Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. - Yes running Local Server
  3.  Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email.
[cid:image007.png@01DBADEF.AAAB1790]

  1.  Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? - Not sure

To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally.
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host.
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal.

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error.
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export.

[image]



From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred:

[image]

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

Hi Artem,

 

We’re down to the 6 remaining NAS servers of the scan 



 

These are the largest and do usually take a while for the scan to complete on.

 

I’ll keep you posted if and when these complete.

Hi Artem,

 

Yes, let’s keep the ticket opened until those have completed.

The re-run of the Win1 scan completed and I’m getting the NAS run now.

Hi Sean,

Thank you for the follow up.

Yes, the Out Of Memory issue was affecting the FSAA system scan. Job`s from sub folders are analysis tasks and are not related to Data Collection.

Would you like to keep ticket open until you have results for the NAS and Win1 hosts?

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve checked, and yes the jobs for the 0.Collection group all completed on the 29th March.

 

So I’m guessing the remaining part of the scans are not related to the previous issue.

 

I’m going to stop the scan so the NAS and Win1 jobs can be re-run to validate the “out of memory’ fix. No point delaying that any further.

The remaining subfolder scans can be investigated at another time.

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

The ""2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups"" job is located in another folder in the File System solution group.
This means that the FSAA system scan that was failing with ""System Out Of Memory"" exception has completed as it sits higher in the job order. 

Could you open the File System > 0.Collection group and check if FSAA system scan completed successfully and let me know?

Best regards,

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers. 

It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job 



 

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Artem Naskal

Hi Alison, Sean, 

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception. 

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception. 

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan. 

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan. 

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run. 
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs. 

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news. 

Thank you!

Hi Alison, 

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred. 
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server? 

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison, 

Thank you for the prompt reply. 

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server. 
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it 

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server. 
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison, 

Thank you for uploading the logs. 

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:





To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Artem Naskal

Subject: [EXTERNAL] System.OutOfMemoryException while running FSAA System Scan [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0NG31c:ref ]



 

Hello All-State Team, 

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:


	What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
	Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
	Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue





	If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
	Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server
	Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email. 





	Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? –  Not sure


To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally. 
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host. 
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal. 

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error. 
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export. 



 

From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 

 

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply. 
Thank you!

This is Artem. I am sending a follow up to the ticket about System Out Of Memory exception.

As we discussed on a meeting today the System Out Of Memory exception was reesolved after we updated paging file settings and moved Page file to D: drive.
I will proceed with closing of this ticket then.

The following is a recap of this ticket resolution for your records:

FSAA system scan job for the last 6 hosts failed with this error as seen in the job log:
19/03/2025 23:51:58 DEBUG StealthAUDIT(TDispatch) TDispatch.ExecuteJob ""Thread is waiting for work"" GL-9185-WNAS67P 5 11680 12872
20/03/2025 02:22:16 DEBUG FILESYSTEMACCESS AccessScanTask ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]"" MW-0775-WNAS20P DCExtract 11812 11680 12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40 DEBUG FILESYSTEMACCESS AccessScanTask ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown."" JX-0245-WNAS00P DCExtract 8992 11680 12872

It was confirmed that the root cause of this issue is lack of space for the Page file on the server.

Thus, we checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

After applying these changes we saw that FSAA system scan job no longer fails with ""Out Of memory"" errors.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return.
In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did.
Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Hi Artem,

 

We’re down to the 6 remaining NAS servers of the scan 



 

These are the largest and do usually take a while for the scan to complete on.

 

I’ll keep you posted if and when these complete.

Hi Artem,

 

Yes, let’s keep the ticket opened until those have completed.

The re-run of the Win1 scan completed and I’m getting the NAS run now.

Hi Sean,

Thank you for the follow up.

Yes, the Out Of Memory issue was affecting the FSAA system scan. Job`s from sub folders are analysis tasks and are not related to Data Collection.

Would you like to keep ticket open until you have results for the NAS and Win1 hosts?

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve checked, and yes the jobs for the 0.Collection group all completed on the 29th March.

 

So I’m guessing the remaining part of the scans are not related to the previous issue.

 

I’m going to stop the scan so the NAS and Win1 jobs can be re-run to validate the “out of memory’ fix. No point delaying that any further.

The remaining subfolder scans can be investigated at another time.

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

The ""2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups"" job is located in another folder in the File System solution group.
This means that the FSAA system scan that was failing with ""System Out Of Memory"" exception has completed as it sits higher in the job order. 

Could you open the File System > 0.Collection group and check if FSAA system scan completed successfully and let me know?

Hi Artem,

 

I’ve been waiting on the rest of the scan to finish that was originally kicked off on the 26th March to scan the Windows servers. 

It appears the job has gotten stuck doing the 2.Direct Permissions/FS_LocalUsersAndGroups part of the job 



 

I want to check if I should stop the scan so I can complete the others tasks (re-scan Win1 and the remaining 6 NAS servers) to get all the remaining data?

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

As we agreed, please, let me know how FSAA system scans complete now and if System Out Of Memory occurs again.
I will place our ticket on hold so that you have enough time to test it out. If you have any additional questions or if you notice new issues - just let me know, I am happy to help.

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Hi Alison, Sean, 

I have an update for you regarding System Out Of memory exception. 

The main reason for this error is most likely lack of disk space for the Page file.
As Alison rightfully mentioned on our last meeting - C drive had only around 10GB of free space, this could have caused FSAA system scan to end due to Out Of Memory exception. 

I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can check Page file configuration together and adjust it accordingly to avoid System AOut Of memory exception during FSAA system scan. 

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:

Hi Alison, Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 

We checked Windows Application event logs on A0775-APP2356-S at 4 AM on 20th of March and confirmed it was in fact Enterprise Auditor server A0775-APP2356-S that run out of memory while executing FSAA system scan. 

To try avoiding out of memory exception during next FSAA system scan run we agreed to lower number of concurrent threads to 5 and then target job only at those servers that have failed during previous run. 
Please, let me know results of this next FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import job runs. 

In the meantime, I will clarify the best practice for avoiding System Out Of Memory exception on Enterprise Auditor server for File System solution and FSAA System Scans in particular and will get back to you as soon as I have news. 

Thank you!

Hi Alison, 

I have analyzed the event logs uploaded but they do not have correct timestamps from when the Out of Memory exception occurred. 
Scan has failed around 4 AM on 20th of March.
As such, could you collect Application Event logs that start from midnight 20th of March up to 21st of March from the A0775-APP2356-S server? 

Also, have you considered restarting the NAS hosts scan with decreased number of concurrent threads? 

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Alison, 

Thank you for the prompt reply. 

Correct, the job was started on 18th of March:
18/03/2025 05:50:01    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.ConnectProfile()    ""Start""            1800    11680    12872

But then job failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" on 20th of March:
20/03/2025 02:22:16    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""    MW-0775-WNAS20P    DCExtract    11812    11680    12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""    JX-0245-WNAS00P    DCExtract    8992    11680    12872

To determine when exactly this happened on A0775-APP2356-S server we need to analyze Windows Application event logs from between 18th and 21st of March from this server. 
Could you collect Windows Application event logs from 18th to 21st of March from A0775-APP2356-S server and upload it 

The reason why I suggested to lower the number of concurrent threads is because this should lower the load on RAM on the server as the scan is running locally - meaning that scan is using resources of A0775-APP2356-S server. 
This will potentially lower performance, yes, but at least it will make scan more stable by making it consume less RAM resources.

Hello Sean, Alison, 

Thank you for uploading the logs. 

I have checked the event logs uploaded but I can only see Windows Events from 18th of March there:



Could you check the Application Event logs on A0775-APP2356-S server and if events from 20th of March exist - re-export them again and attach to ticket?

There was no run on 20 March:





To continue, in the full log bundle for the NAS hosts FSAA scan I can see a run from 24th of March. May I ask you to clarify, was it terminated manually? Yes it was as it was started erroneously.

In any case, the ""Out of Memory"" exception error indicates that server where Enterprise Auditor is installed has run out of memory when the FSAA system scan was executed. How can we determine when this is going to happen?
As such, may I ask you to lower number of Concurrent Threads here to 5, then restart the job and let me know the results? Why would this make a difference as this would lengthen out the scan time? At present we need these scans to run by the end of this week!

Per the tickets in the queue, we have been trying to get all our quarter-end scans to run since February.

Hello All-State Team, 

This is Artem here, with a separate ticket for troubleshooting ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error during FSAA system scan. 
I am sorry to hear that your FSAA system scan did not complete successfully during last job run. I assure you that we will provide you with the best solution for it! 

To understand issue better and isolate root cause I need additional information from your side:


	What is the hostname of the Enterprise Auditor server where FSAA system scan job has failed? Is it Y0185-APP0443-S? – On Production Server: A0775-APP2356-S
	Could you share the amount of RAM resources provisioned to this Enterprise Auditor server?   - CPU = 8, RAM = 24
	Please, run this PowerShell command on the Enterprise Auditor server in question so we can get the exact build number: Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue





	If my understanding is correct, this job is processing NAS hosts. What is the number of NAS hosts in the host list assigned to this job? – Total = 120,
	Is this job configured for a local scan mode? To check that you need to open ""Query Properties""> ""Configure"" > then check ""Applet settings"" and ""Scan serever selection"" tabs. – Yes running Local Server
	Please, right click FSAA system scan job that has failed > select Properties > navigate to ""Performance"" tab > take screenshot of these settings and attach it to the next email. 





	Is this the first time when this issue occurred on this NEA host? –  Not sure


To continue, since job has failed with ""System.OutOfMemoryException"" error - then this error should also be visible in the Windows Application event logs from the server that was used as Scanning server.

If I remember correctly, you are not using FSAA file system proxy for your Enterprise Auditor servers, as such all scans should be running locally. 
If you are not sure, then follow step 5. from the list of questions above to clarify which server is selected as the FSAA Scanning host. 
Once you confirm the host, collect Windows Application event logs from it and share them by uploading to the ticket via customer portal. 

To continue, it will help me analyze issue if you could share full Job log as well as additional support logs from the Enterprise Auditor server affected by the error. 
Right click on the Job experiencing problem and select Export. 



 

From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 

 

Collect this Log folder from the Enterprise Auditor server:
%Install path here%STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

Please, upload Windows Application events, Job logs, Job messages and SADatabaseLogs folder to the ticket using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
Please let me know once the files are uploaded.

I am looking forward to your reply. 
Thank you!
