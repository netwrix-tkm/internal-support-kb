Hello Ibrahim,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical support.
My name is Artem, I will be assisting you with this ticket.

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:

  *   End customer is TurkishAirlines, is that correct?  Yes
  *   According to information you provided issue started around 16th of February, is that correct? We cannot see the File System Activity logs in database after this date(16 Feb.).
  *   When was the last successful FSAA System Scan performed at Turkish Airlines environment?  16 Feb 2025
  *   What has changed in that environment since the last successful FSAA system scan? We upgraded Enterprise Auditor from 11.5 to 11.6 at 18 Feb. 2025.
  *   You tried resetting certificates for FSAA system scan. Why you decided to try this troubleshooting step? Because when I ran job in first time Certificate Exchange Option Mechanism is selected as Manuel.(I cleared certificates and i selected Automatic adter that i ran again the job.)
  *   Please, run this command on a Turkish Airlines Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server and provide output of it. This information is needed to determine the exact build number of installed Netwrix solutions:

    Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue In addition to the above, please, follow this instruction to collect a complete log bundle for the FSAA system scan job that is currently failing:



The output :

Besides this in previous FSAC scan log I can see some issues with obtaining information about SbtFileMon.ini config file for the host ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV:
Unable to start scan: Failed to get INI file path from registry for ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV trying to get FSAC log path: Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation.

As such, I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can have a closer look at the Activity Monitor Agent settings, its SBTFileMon.ini config file as well as review Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) FSAA and FSAC system Scans settings.

Hi Ibrahim,

Just a small follow up.
The screenshot with PowerShell output that customer shared does not have ""Version"" column.
Please, ask them to run this PowerShell prompt again and provide information from the ""Version"" column:

Thank you for your time during our meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

First of all we must ensure that FSAA system scan is running successfully. As such, we started checking FSAA system scan settings and configurations required for it:


	We ensured that Connection Profile account is added to either Local Administrators or Backup Admins local group on NEA server.
	We checked the hostlist configured for FSAA system scan job and verified that NetAPP host has correct OS Type (NAS) and OS version (NetAPP).
	We checked FSAA Applet logs on the NEA server because FSAA system scan is running locally - FSAA Applet logs suggested that NEA server could not secure communication with FSAA Applet (scanning process).


Based on the errors we found in FSAA Applet logs we tried creating FSAA System Scan certificates manually. We then also changed FSAA System Scan query settings and selected ""Manual"" certificates management for FSAA applet.

After this we restarted the jobs. Job failed again, but this time the error message was different FSAA Applet logs now indicate that the issue is with securing communication between NEA host and NetAPP host.

To continue investigation I need to analyze latest FSAA System Scan and FSAA Applet logs.
We exported these logs and placed them into archive with 09_04_2025 date in the name on the desktop of the NEA host.
Please, upload this archive to the ticket ""00440823 - Fsaa and FSAC System Scan Errors"" using customer portal and notify me once the upload is completed.

However, we did not test if the ports for HTTPS connection between NEA server and AVRASYA NetAPP host are openned.
As such, may I ask you to run these commands from PowerShell on the NEA host and let me know results?:

NOTE: Please, run each command separately. Commands must be run from NEA host.

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 445
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 80
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 443

Please, share results of each command with me. Thank you!

To continue, we also discussed that we need to ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that all configurations on NetAPP server are configured correctly as described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

To recap:


	Please, upload archive with logs we collected today. I will analyze these logs from my side and will get back to you once I have news.
	Please, run each ""Test-NetConnection"" command from NEA host separately and let me know result of each one.
	Ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that NetAPP is configured correctly for FSAA system scans as described here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

Hi Ibrahim,

Thank you for your time during our meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

First of all we must ensure that FSAA system scan is running successfully. As such, we started checking FSAA system scan settings and configurations required for it:

  *   We ensured that Connection Profile account is added to either Local Administrators or Backup Admins local group on NEA server.
  *   We checked the hostlist configured for FSAA system scan job and verified that NetAPP host has correct OS Type (NAS) and OS version (NetAPP).
  *   We checked FSAA Applet logs on the NEA server because FSAA system scan is running locally - FSAA Applet logs suggested that NEA server could not secure communication with FSAA Applet (scanning process).

Based on the errors we found in FSAA Applet logs we tried creating FSAA System Scan certificates manually. We then also changed FSAA System Scan query settings and selected ""Manual"" certificates management for FSAA applet.

After this we restarted the jobs. Job failed again, but this time the error message was different FSAA Applet logs now indicate that the issue is with securing communication between NEA host and NetAPP host.

To continue investigation I need to analyze latest FSAA System Scan and FSAA Applet logs.
We exported these logs and placed them into archive with 09_04_2025 date in the name on the desktop of the NEA host.
Please, upload this archive to the ticket ""00440823 - Fsaa and FSAC System Scan Errors"" using customer portal and notify me once the upload is completed.

However, we did not test if the ports for HTTPS connection between NEA server and AVRASYA NetAPP host are openned.
As such, may I ask you to run these commands from PowerShell on the NEA host and let me know results?:

NOTE: Please, run each command separately. Commands must be run from NEA host.

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 445
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 80
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 443

Please, share results of each command with me. Thank you!

To continue, we also discussed that we need to ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that all configurations on NetAPP server are configured correctly as described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

To recap:

  *   Please, upload archive with logs we collected today. I will analyze these logs from my side and will get back to you once I have news.
  *   Please, run each ""Test-NetConnection"" command from NEA host separately and let me know result of each one.
  *   Ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that NetAPP is configured correctly for FSAA system scans as described here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

Hello Ibrahim,

Thank you for sharing the build number and logs.
I have checked logs provided and I can see the following errors for the FSAA system scan:

01/04/2025 21:00:48    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""System.TimeoutException: Retry timeout exceeded ---> System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request. ---> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. ---> System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.     at System.Net.TlsStream.EndWrite(IAsyncResult asyncResult)     at System.Net.PooledStream.EndWrite(IAsyncResult asyncResult)     at System.Net.ConnectStream.WriteHeadersCallback(IAsyncResult ar)

I can see similar errors in the latest FSAC scan log - errors I see there also indicate that Enterprise Auditor was unable to communicate with Proxy server correctly and as a result scan was not initiated:
Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute    ""Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied

Besides this in previous FSAC scan log I can see some issues with obtaining information about SbtFileMon.ini config file for the host ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV:
Unable to start scan: Failed to get INI file path from registry for ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV trying to get FSAC log path: Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation.

As such, I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can have a closer look at the Activity Monitor Agent settings, its SBTFileMon.ini config file as well as review Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) FSAA and FSAC system Scans settings.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:

Hi Ibrahim,

Just a small follow up.
The screenshot with PowerShell output that customer shared does not have ""Version"" column.
Please, ask them to run this PowerShell prompt again and provide information from the ""Version"" column:

Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Hi Ibrahim,

Thank you for your time during our meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

First of all we must ensure that FSAA system scan is running successfully. As such, we started checking FSAA system scan settings and configurations required for it:


	We ensured that Connection Profile account is added to either Local Administrators or Backup Admins local group on NEA server.
	We checked the hostlist configured for FSAA system scan job and verified that NetAPP host has correct OS Type (NAS) and OS version (NetAPP).
	We checked FSAA Applet logs on the NEA server because FSAA system scan is running locally - FSAA Applet logs suggested that NEA server could not secure communication with FSAA Applet (scanning process).


Based on the errors we found in FSAA Applet logs we tried creating FSAA System Scan certificates manually. We then also changed FSAA System Scan query settings and selected ""Manual"" certificates management for FSAA applet.

After this we restarted the jobs. Job failed again, but this time the error message was different FSAA Applet logs now indicate that the issue is with securing communication between NEA host and NetAPP host.

To continue investigation I need to analyze latest FSAA System Scan and FSAA Applet logs.
We exported these logs and placed them into archive with 09_04_2025 date in the name on the desktop of the NEA host.
Please, upload this archive to the ticket ""00440823 - Fsaa and FSAC System Scan Errors"" using customer portal and notify me once the upload is completed.

However, we did not test if the ports for HTTPS connection between NEA server and AVRASYA NetAPP host are openned.
As such, may I ask you to run these commands from PowerShell on the NEA host and let me know results?:

NOTE: Please, run each command separately. Commands must be run from NEA host.

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 445
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 80
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 443

Please, share results of each command with me. Thank you!

To continue, we also discussed that we need to ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that all configurations on NetAPP server are configured correctly as described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

To recap:


	Please, upload archive with logs we collected today. I will analyze these logs from my side and will get back to you once I have news.
	Please, run each ""Test-NetConnection"" command from NEA host separately and let me know result of each one.
	Ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that NetAPP is configured correctly for FSAA system scans as described here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

Hello Ibrahim,

Thank you for sharing the build number and logs.
I have checked logs provided and I can see the following errors for the FSAA system scan:

01/04/2025 21:00:48    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""System.TimeoutException: Retry timeout exceeded ---> System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request. ---> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. ---> System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.     at System.Net.TlsStream.EndWrite(IAsyncResult asyncResult)     at System.Net.PooledStream.EndWrite(IAsyncResult asyncResult)     at System.Net.ConnectStream.WriteHeadersCallback(IAsyncResult ar)

I can see similar errors in the latest FSAC scan log - errors I see there also indicate that Enterprise Auditor was unable to communicate with Proxy server correctly and as a result scan was not initiated:
Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute    ""Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied

Besides this in previous FSAC scan log I can see some issues with obtaining information about SbtFileMon.ini config file for the host ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV:
Unable to start scan: Failed to get INI file path from registry for ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV trying to get FSAC log path: Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation.

As such, I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can have a closer look at the Activity Monitor Agent settings, its SBTFileMon.ini config file as well as review Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) FSAA and FSAC system Scans settings.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:

The screenshot with PowerShell output that customer shared does not have ""Version"" column.
Please, ask them to run this PowerShell prompt again and provide information from the ""Version"" column:

Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Thank you!

Best regards,

Hi Ibrahim,

Thank you for your time during our meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

First of all we must ensure that FSAA system scan is running successfully. As such, we started checking FSAA system scan settings and configurations required for it:


	We ensured that Connection Profile account is added to either Local Administrators or Backup Admins local group on NEA server.
	We checked the hostlist configured for FSAA system scan job and verified that NetAPP host has correct OS Type (NAS) and OS version (NetAPP).
	We checked FSAA Applet logs on the NEA server because FSAA system scan is running locally - FSAA Applet logs suggested that NEA server could not secure communication with FSAA Applet (scanning process).


Based on the errors we found in FSAA Applet logs we tried creating FSAA System Scan certificates manually. We then also changed FSAA System Scan query settings and selected ""Manual"" certificates management for FSAA applet.

After this we restarted the jobs. Job failed again, but this time the error message was different FSAA Applet logs now indicate that the issue is with securing communication between NEA host and NetAPP host.

To continue investigation I need to analyze latest FSAA System Scan and FSAA Applet logs.
We exported these logs and placed them into archive with 09_04_2025 date in the name on the desktop of the NEA host.
Please, upload this archive to the ticket ""00440823 - Fsaa and FSAC System Scan Errors"" using customer portal and notify me once the upload is completed.

However, we did not test if the ports for HTTPS connection between NEA server and AVRASYA NetAPP host are openned.
As such, may I ask you to run these commands from PowerShell on the NEA host and let me know results?:

NOTE: Please, run each command separately. Commands must be run from NEA host.

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 445
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 80
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 443

Please, share results of each command with me. Thank you!

To continue, we also discussed that we need to ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that all configurations on NetAPP server are configured correctly as described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

To recap:


	Please, upload archive with logs we collected today. I will analyze these logs from my side and will get back to you once I have news.
	Please, run each ""Test-NetConnection"" command from NEA host separately and let me know result of each one.
	Ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that NetAPP is configured correctly for FSAA system scans as described here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

Hello Ibrahim,

Thank you for sharing the build number and logs.
I have checked logs provided and I can see the following errors for the FSAA system scan:

01/04/2025 21:00:48    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""System.TimeoutException: Retry timeout exceeded ---> System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request. ---> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. ---> System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.     at System.Net.TlsStream.EndWrite(IAsyncResult asyncResult)     at System.Net.PooledStream.EndWrite(IAsyncResult asyncResult)     at System.Net.ConnectStream.WriteHeadersCallback(IAsyncResult ar)

I can see similar errors in the latest FSAC scan log - errors I see there also indicate that Enterprise Auditor was unable to communicate with Proxy server correctly and as a result scan was not initiated:
Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute    ""Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied

Besides this in previous FSAC scan log I can see some issues with obtaining information about SbtFileMon.ini config file for the host ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV:
Unable to start scan: Failed to get INI file path from registry for ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV trying to get FSAC log path: Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation.

As such, I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can have a closer look at the Activity Monitor Agent settings, its SBTFileMon.ini config file as well as review Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) FSAA and FSAC system Scans settings.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:

Hi Ibrahim,

Just a small follow up.
The screenshot with PowerShell output that customer shared does not have ""Version"" column.
Please, ask them to run this PowerShell prompt again and provide information from the ""Version"" column:

Thank you for your time today.
The following is a recap of what we tested today:

Last time we tried running FSAA scan for NetAPP target using Local Mode scan with Manual certificates. This was to test if the issue was due to incorrect Hostname in the certificate information.

However, our last test failed with this error:
2025-04-09 12:33:28.5512|DEBUG| 13|Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https.Internal.HttpsConnectionMiddleware|Failed to authenticate HTTPS connection.
System.IO.IOException: Received an unexpected EOF or 0 bytes from the transport stream.

After speaking with my team we came to conclusion that issue is not caused by incorrect certificates, but instead is caused by an error when Stealth Audit server hostname is checked against this certificate.
Currently it looks like this error is caused due to Stealth Audit server NetBIOS name having more than 15 characters.

To confirm this we did this test today:
We enabled ""Automatic"" certificates for the local mode scan.
We targeted windows server instead of NetAPP server.

We got exactly the same error after running FSAA job:
Failed to authenticate HTTPS connection.
System.IO.IOException: Received an unexpected EOF or 0 bytes from the transport stream.

This means that it does not matter which certificates we select, or which target host we select - the error is the same.
To resolve this issue for FSAA (Permission) System Scan and FSAC (Activity) System Scan I suggest decreasing the length of NetBIOS name for Stealth Audit server and the FSAA Proxy Server.
Please, let me know if you have any additional questions or if additional assistance is needed - I am happy to help.

Artem Naskal

Hi Ibrahim,

Thank you for your time during our meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

First of all we must ensure that FSAA system scan is running successfully. As such, we started checking FSAA system scan settings and configurations required for it:


	We ensured that Connection Profile account is added to either Local Administrators or Backup Admins local group on NEA server.
	We checked the hostlist configured for FSAA system scan job and verified that NetAPP host has correct OS Type (NAS) and OS version (NetAPP).
	We checked FSAA Applet logs on the NEA server because FSAA system scan is running locally - FSAA Applet logs suggested that NEA server could not secure communication with FSAA Applet (scanning process).


Based on the errors we found in FSAA Applet logs we tried creating FSAA System Scan certificates manually. We then also changed FSAA System Scan query settings and selected ""Manual"" certificates management for FSAA applet.

After this we restarted the jobs. Job failed again, but this time the error message was different FSAA Applet logs now indicate that the issue is with securing communication between NEA host and NetAPP host.

To continue investigation I need to analyze latest FSAA System Scan and FSAA Applet logs.
We exported these logs and placed them into archive with 09_04_2025 date in the name on the desktop of the NEA host.
Please, upload this archive to the ticket ""00440823 - Fsaa and FSAC System Scan Errors"" using customer portal and notify me once the upload is completed.

However, we did not test if the ports for HTTPS connection between NEA server and AVRASYA NetAPP host are openned.
As such, may I ask you to run these commands from PowerShell on the NEA host and let me know results?:

NOTE: Please, run each command separately. Commands must be run from NEA host.

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 445
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 80
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 443

Please, share results of each command with me. Thank you!

To continue, we also discussed that we need to ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that all configurations on NetAPP server are configured correctly as described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

To recap:


	Please, upload archive with logs we collected today. I will analyze these logs from my side and will get back to you once I have news.
	Please, run each ""Test-NetConnection"" command from NEA host separately and let me know result of each one.
	Ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that NetAPP is configured correctly for FSAA system scans as described here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

Hello Ibrahim,

Thank you for sharing the build number and logs.
I have checked logs provided and I can see the following errors for the FSAA system scan:

01/04/2025 21:00:48    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""System.TimeoutException: Retry timeout exceeded ---> System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request. ---> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. ---> System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.     at System.Net.TlsStream.EndWrite(IAsyncResult asyncResult)     at System.Net.PooledStream.EndWrite(IAsyncResult asyncResult)     at System.Net.ConnectStream.WriteHeadersCallback(IAsyncResult ar)

I can see similar errors in the latest FSAC scan log - errors I see there also indicate that Enterprise Auditor was unable to communicate with Proxy server correctly and as a result scan was not initiated:
Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute    ""Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied

Besides this in previous FSAC scan log I can see some issues with obtaining information about SbtFileMon.ini config file for the host ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV:
Unable to start scan: Failed to get INI file path from registry for ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV trying to get FSAC log path: Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation.

As such, I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can have a closer look at the Activity Monitor Agent settings, its SBTFileMon.ini config file as well as review Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) FSAA and FSAC system Scans settings.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:

The screenshot with PowerShell output that customer shared does not have ""Version"" column.
Please, ask them to run this PowerShell prompt again and provide information from the ""Version"" column:

Hi Artem,

We received a request from our customer stating that they are unable to rename the existing server names by taking only the first 15 characters (due to internal(company) hostname naming standards). Would it be a problem to use a different name instead?

Thanks,

Ibrahim Fil

Hello Ibrahim,

Thank you for your time today.
The following is a recap of what we tested today:

Last time we tried running FSAA scan for NetAPP target using Local Mode scan with Manual certificates. This was to test if the issue was due to incorrect Hostname in the certificate information.

However, our last test failed with this error:
2025-04-09 12:33:28.5512|DEBUG| 13|Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https.Internal.HttpsConnectionMiddleware|Failed to authenticate HTTPS connection.
System.IO.IOException: Received an unexpected EOF or 0 bytes from the transport stream.

After speaking with my team we came to conclusion that issue is not caused by incorrect certificates, but instead is caused by an error when Stealth Audit server hostname is checked against this certificate.
Currently it looks like this error is caused due to Stealth Audit server NetBIOS name having more than 15 characters.

To confirm this we did this test today:
We enabled ""Automatic"" certificates for the local mode scan.
We targeted windows server instead of NetAPP server.

We got exactly the same error after running FSAA job:
Failed to authenticate HTTPS connection.
System.IO.IOException: Received an unexpected EOF or 0 bytes from the transport stream.

This means that it does not matter which certificates we select, or which target host we select - the error is the same.
To resolve this issue for FSAA (Permission) System Scan and FSAC (Activity) System Scan I suggest decreasing the length of NetBIOS name for Stealth Audit server and the FSAA Proxy Server.
Please, let me know if you have any additional questions or if additional assistance is needed - I am happy to help.

Artem Naskal

Hi Ibrahim,

Thank you for your time during our meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

First of all we must ensure that FSAA system scan is running successfully. As such, we started checking FSAA system scan settings and configurations required for it:

  *   We ensured that Connection Profile account is added to either Local Administrators or Backup Admins local group on NEA server.
  *   We checked the hostlist configured for FSAA system scan job and verified that NetAPP host has correct OS Type (NAS) and OS version (NetAPP).
  *   We checked FSAA Applet logs on the NEA server because FSAA system scan is running locally - FSAA Applet logs suggested that NEA server could not secure communication with FSAA Applet (scanning process).

Based on the errors we found in FSAA Applet logs we tried creating FSAA System Scan certificates manually. We then also changed FSAA System Scan query settings and selected ""Manual"" certificates management for FSAA applet.

After this we restarted the jobs. Job failed again, but this time the error message was different FSAA Applet logs now indicate that the issue is with securing communication between NEA host and NetAPP host.

To continue investigation I need to analyze latest FSAA System Scan and FSAA Applet logs.
We exported these logs and placed them into archive with 09_04_2025 date in the name on the desktop of the NEA host.
Please, upload this archive to the ticket ""00440823 - Fsaa and FSAC System Scan Errors"" using customer portal and notify me once the upload is completed.

However, we did not test if the ports for HTTPS connection between NEA server and AVRASYA NetAPP host are openned.
As such, may I ask you to run these commands from PowerShell on the NEA host and let me know results?:

NOTE: Please, run each command separately. Commands must be run from NEA host.

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 445
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 80
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 443

Please, share results of each command with me. Thank you!

To continue, we also discussed that we need to ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that all configurations on NetAPP server are configured correctly as described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

To recap:

  *   Please, upload archive with logs we collected today. I will analyze these logs from my side and will get back to you once I have news.
  *   Please, run each ""Test-NetConnection"" command from NEA host separately and let me know result of each one.
  *   Ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that NetAPP is configured correctly for FSAA system scans as described here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

Thank you for the reply.

As of now the requirement is to have a NetBIOS name of the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) server shorter than 15 characters.
It does not matter if the same characters will be used or if a new name is introduced.

Please, let me know if this answers your question or if additional assistance is needed. I will be happy to help and answer!
Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Hi Artem,

 

We received a request from our customer stating that they are unable to rename the existing server names by taking only the first 15 characters (due to internal(company) hostname naming standards). Would it be a problem to use a different name instead?

 

Thanks,

 

Ibrahim Fil

Hello Ibrahim, 

Thank you for your time today.
The following is a recap of what we tested today:

Last time we tried running FSAA scan for NetAPP target using Local Mode scan with Manual certificates. This was to test if the issue was due to incorrect Hostname in the certificate information.

However, our last test failed with this error:
2025-04-09 12:33:28.5512|DEBUG| 13|Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Https.Internal.HttpsConnectionMiddleware|Failed to authenticate HTTPS connection.
System.IO.IOException: Received an unexpected EOF or 0 bytes from the transport stream.

After speaking with my team we came to conclusion that issue is not caused by incorrect certificates, but instead is caused by an error when Stealth Audit server hostname is checked against this certificate.
Currently it looks like this error is caused due to Stealth Audit server NetBIOS name having more than 15 characters.

To confirm this we did this test today:
We enabled ""Automatic"" certificates for the local mode scan.
We targeted windows server instead of NetAPP server.

We got exactly the same error after running FSAA job:
Failed to authenticate HTTPS connection.
System.IO.IOException: Received an unexpected EOF or 0 bytes from the transport stream.

This means that it does not matter which certificates we select, or which target host we select - the error is the same.
To resolve this issue for FSAA (Permission) System Scan and FSAC (Activity) System Scan I suggest decreasing the length of NetBIOS name for Stealth Audit server and the FSAA Proxy Server.
Please, let me know if you have any additional questions or if additional assistance is needed - I am happy to help.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Ibrahim,

Thank you for your time during our meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

First of all we must ensure that FSAA system scan is running successfully. As such, we started checking FSAA system scan settings and configurations required for it:


	We ensured that Connection Profile account is added to either Local Administrators or Backup Admins local group on NEA server.
	We checked the hostlist configured for FSAA system scan job and verified that NetAPP host has correct OS Type (NAS) and OS version (NetAPP).
	We checked FSAA Applet logs on the NEA server because FSAA system scan is running locally - FSAA Applet logs suggested that NEA server could not secure communication with FSAA Applet (scanning process).


Based on the errors we found in FSAA Applet logs we tried creating FSAA System Scan certificates manually. We then also changed FSAA System Scan query settings and selected ""Manual"" certificates management for FSAA applet.

After this we restarted the jobs. Job failed again, but this time the error message was different FSAA Applet logs now indicate that the issue is with securing communication between NEA host and NetAPP host.

To continue investigation I need to analyze latest FSAA System Scan and FSAA Applet logs.
We exported these logs and placed them into archive with 09_04_2025 date in the name on the desktop of the NEA host.
Please, upload this archive to the ticket ""00440823 - Fsaa and FSAC System Scan Errors"" using customer portal and notify me once the upload is completed.

However, we did not test if the ports for HTTPS connection between NEA server and AVRASYA NetAPP host are openned.
As such, may I ask you to run these commands from PowerShell on the NEA host and let me know results?:

NOTE: Please, run each command separately. Commands must be run from NEA host.

Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 445
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 80
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName AVRASYA -Port 443

Please, share results of each command with me. Thank you!

To continue, we also discussed that we need to ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that all configurations on NetAPP server are configured correctly as described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

To recap:


	Please, upload archive with logs we collected today. I will analyze these logs from my side and will get back to you once I have news.
	Please, run each ""Test-NetConnection"" command from NEA host separately and let me know result of each one.
	Ask customer`s NetAPP team to verify that NetAPP is configured correctly for FSAA system scans as described here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm

I am looking forward to your reply.
Thank you!

Hello Ibrahim,

Thank you for sharing the build number and logs.
I have checked logs provided and I can see the following errors for the FSAA system scan:

01/04/2025 21:00:48    DEBUG    FILESYSTEMACCESS    AccessScanTask    ""System.TimeoutException: Retry timeout exceeded ---> System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: An error occurred while sending the request. ---> System.Net.WebException: The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel. ---> System.Security.Authentication.AuthenticationException: The remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure.     at System.Net.TlsStream.EndWrite(IAsyncResult asyncResult)     at System.Net.PooledStream.EndWrite(IAsyncResult asyncResult)     at System.Net.ConnectStream.WriteHeadersCallback(IAsyncResult ar)

I can see similar errors in the latest FSAC scan log - errors I see there also indicate that Enterprise Auditor was unable to communicate with Proxy server correctly and as a result scan was not initiated:
Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute    ""Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied

Besides this in previous FSAC scan log I can see some issues with obtaining information about SbtFileMon.ini config file for the host ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV:
Unable to start scan: Failed to get INI file path from registry for ISTPPRXYAVRASYAV trying to get FSAC log path: Attempted to perform an unauthorized operation.

As such, I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session where we can have a closer look at the Activity Monitor Agent settings, its SBTFileMon.ini config file as well as review Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) FSAA and FSAC system Scans settings.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:

Hi Ibrahim,

Just a small follow up.
The screenshot with PowerShell output that customer shared does not have ""Version"" column.
Please, ask them to run this PowerShell prompt again and provide information from the ""Version"" column:

Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
