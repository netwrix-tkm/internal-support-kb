Hello Saveetha, 

I have not heard back from you after our last meeting and wanted to ask if you had an update from Networking team. 
Did Networking team had any questions or updates based on the tests we performed during our last meeting using GLOBALs-stealthnetapp account and the PowerShell script? 

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Hello Saveetha, Fenil, 

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 
Here is a recap of today`s meeting for your records:

Using a PowerShell script that is attached to this email we tested connection to IPC$ share of the Target NetApp hosts from Proxy servers. 
The test was performed using credentials of the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account - because this is the account that the FSAA scans are configured to use. 

First, we performed test for the FRBBI site for which FSAA scan is failing, where Proxy is FRBBI-IMS02 and target NetApp is BBI01-NS012. 
Using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account the PowerShell script could not connect to \BBI01-NS012IPC$ share:


The same issue is happening during FSAA scan - the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is used from FRBBI-IMS02 proxy.
But the scan is failing with ""Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol"" because FRBBI-IMS02 proxy cannot connect to IPC$ share of the BBI01-NS012 target using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"". 

We also performed the same test but for proxy servers and target NetApp hosts for which the FSAA scan is successful.
Using PowerShell script and ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account we successfully connected to IPC$ share of the target NetApp hosts for which scan runs successfully:
DEIDUICS-OFS012:


ACM01-NS012:


Results of these tests performed with script correlate with results of the FSAA scans in StealthAudit.
As such, the script can be used by your Networking team as a valid tool for troubleshooting of the issue. 

According to information we collected so far using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account from some proxy servers works, but when the same account is used from other proxy servers - then FSAA scan fails (such as in case of FRBBI-IMS02 proxy for example). 
As we agreed, you will contact Networking team and provide this PowerShell Script to them as well as results of the tests we performed today. 

 

To continue, we also discussed this error message:
Failed to copy StealthAUDIT.lic file to base FSAA folder: Access is denied""

In previous tickets this issue was known to be resolved after restart of the StealthAudit console. As such, please, restart the StealthAudit console, then retry the FSAA scan that was failing with this error and let me know results. 
If the issue is still taking place - I will open a separate ticket for it to continue investigation. 

 

I am looking forward to hearing back from you!

Artem Naskal

Hello Saveetha, Fenil, 

Thank you very much for your time on a meeting today.
I am pleased to say that we made progress today because we isolated the issue to the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account.

Here is a recap of what we did today:

Allow me to describe an issue once more to make sure we cover all the details.
Currently you are experiencing an issue with FSAA permission scans for many NetApp hosts from GLOBAL and NHY domains. 
Each of the target NetApp host mentioned has their own corresponding Proxy server. 

Each of these proxy servers use the same connection profile:
GLOBAL NETAPP

This connection profile consists of these two service accounts:
GLOBALs-stealthnetapp (Active Directory Account) - this account is used to connect to target NetApp host from Proxy server.
NHYs01305proxy (StealthAudit task (Domain)) - this account is used to connect to Proxy from Stealth Audit server using Secure RPC.

On today`s remote session we checked required network ports and WMI connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers.
Ports 445 and 135 are opened and WMI connection test was successful as well.

Also, we confirmed that connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers using ""NHYs01305proxy"" account for ""Secure RPC"" works successfully.
Both Job and FSAA applet logs indicate that connection from Stealth Audit to Proxy can be successfully established when ""NHYs01305proxy"" account is used and ""Use secure RPC connection"" checkbox is enabled in Job Query settings.

However, issue appears when Proxy service tries to connect to target NetApp host using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to enumerate NetApp`s shares.
As such, in order to resolve this issue, you need to find out why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account leads to the error ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" when this account is used from the Proxy servers in question to connect to NetApp target hosts affected by the issue.

We agreed that you will contact Network and NetApp teams to clarify why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is failing to connect to target NetApp hosts from corresponding Proxy servers to access/enumerate available shares. 
In the meantime, we will clarify which isolation test can display issue with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account outside of StealthAudit.  

Please, let me know once you have news from your side. 
And I will reach out to you as soon as I have an update. 

Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
Thank you! 

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hello Artem,

 

Affected element is NetApp which uses below mentioned IMS servers as proxy.
We have shared the respective IMS servers of problematic NetApp.
And also, We can have a meeting scheduled, to get to know the issue in detail which will be easier for investigation.

Hi Saveetha, 

Please, accept my apologies for a delayed reply. Thank you very much for the provided details. 

Allow me additional time to finalize my analysis of the logs provided. Logs will allow me to narrow down scope of the issue and isolate the root cause. 
I will get back to you with a more detailed update by tomorrow. 

I just wanted to ask if you could help me clarify one detail about the list of affected servers. 
In the list of affected servers there are ""IMS Servers"" as well. If I remember correctly - these are Proxy servers that are used for scanning target NetApp hosts. 
Is this correct? Could you clarify if these IMS servers are all Enterprise Auditor FSAA proxy servers?:

GLOBAL

	Hi Artem, 

	 
	
	
	Currently several FSAA scans for both NHY and GLOBAL domains are affected by the issue, is that correct? 

	Not several. Some of the Netapps affected with this error message. 
	
	
	What steps to troubleshoot this issue have already been taken?

	Reconfigured job scan
	Re installed SA proxy in respective IMS servers
	Re added the Netapp host in host management. 
	Verified ports are opened. 
	
	 Have you checked connectivity between FSAA scan Proxy server and StealthAudit host with network team? 
	Yes, we verified the port connectivity from source to destination. 
	 
	
	The FSAA scan jobs for NHY and GLOBAL were configured a long time ago and previously were running successfully. As such, can you contact NHY and GLOBAL domain admins to check with them if there were any changes applied to domains? 
	Some netapps not working from the time it was configured. Some were stopped working for past few weeks. 
	 
	When was the last time these FSAA scan jobs run successfully? What is the Date and Time of the last successful run?
	It depends on each netapps. Most probably last three to five scans were failed. 


These are the affected host

Please, note instructions bellow. This information is very important to start our troubleshooting process efficiently and confidently.
Without this information we will have to spend additional time to get it before we are able to continue troubleshooting.
Please, make sure to provide as much details as possible.   

First of all, allow me to clarify additional details, this will help me understand issue better:


	Currently several FSAA scans for both NHY and GLOBAL domains are affected by the issue, is that correct? 
	What steps to troubleshoot this issue have already been taken? Have you checked connectivity between FSAA scan Proxy server and StealthAudit host with network team? 
	The FSAA scan jobs for NHY and GLOBAL were configured a long time ago and previously were running successfully. As such, can you contact NHY and GLOBAL domain admins to check with them if there were any changes applied to domains? 
	When was the last time these FSAA scan jobs run successfully? What is the Date and Time of the last successful run? 


To continue, if my understanding is correct, these are the affected target hosts:
From GLOBAL domain:
BBI01-NS012
CAKENICS-OFS012
CARUAICS-OFS012
MAG01-NS012
USSPDICS-OFS012

From NHY domain:
PSG00-NS012
DKTO3PV-NAO012
FIN00-NS012

As such, please, provide names of the FSAA scan jobs that are scanning these hosts and failing.
Also, provide the host name of the FSAA scan proxy server that is configured to scan these hosts. If there are multiple proxy servers that are scanning these hosts - please, provide thee full list of FSAA Scan Proxy servers. 
 

And last but not least, please, export support logs for the FSAA scan jobs that are failing with the ""Error during processing: Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol"". 
Right click on the Job or Job Group experiencing problems and select Export.","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #435045 -  - Error during processing:  Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol""    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Lb1Ne:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","saveetha.a@kyndryl.com","gergely.sallak@netwrix.com; nagendra.prasad1@kyndryl.com; ramesh.r3@kyndryl.com; fenilkumar.s@kyndryl.com","","true","2025-03-10T13:53:11.000Z","true"

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 
Here is a recap of what we discussed:

NetAPP team has provided access to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account in NetAPP.
We need to understand which permissions were provided to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account by your team to continue troubleshooting. 

Please, contact NetAPP and Networking team and request them to provide screenshots which can show how access was provided, and which permissions exactly were provided to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account from NetAPP side.

We also discussed that the ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" error can be caused due to NHY domain configuration. As such, I would suggest checking domain group policy configuration to see if there is something that could prevent IMS02 proxies from accessing and enumerating shares on the GLOBAL and NHY NetAPP hosts. 

In the meantime, I will consult with my team to see if we can suggest any other isolation tests for the ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" error besides previously provided PowerShell script.

Hello Saveetha, Fenil, 

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 
Here is a recap of today`s meeting for your records:

Using a PowerShell script that is attached to this email we tested connection to IPC$ share of the Target NetApp hosts from Proxy servers. 
The test was performed using credentials of the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account - because this is the account that the FSAA scans are configured to use. 

First, we performed test for the FRBBI site for which FSAA scan is failing, where Proxy is FRBBI-IMS02 and target NetApp is BBI01-NS012. 
Using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account the PowerShell script could not connect to \BBI01-NS012IPC$ share:


The same issue is happening during FSAA scan - the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is used from FRBBI-IMS02 proxy.
But the scan is failing with ""Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol"" because FRBBI-IMS02 proxy cannot connect to IPC$ share of the BBI01-NS012 target using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"". 

We also performed the same test but for proxy servers and target NetApp hosts for which the FSAA scan is successful.
Using PowerShell script and ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account we successfully connected to IPC$ share of the target NetApp hosts for which scan runs successfully:
DEIDUICS-OFS012:


ACM01-NS012:


Results of these tests performed with script correlate with results of the FSAA scans in StealthAudit.
As such, the script can be used by your Networking team as a valid tool for troubleshooting of the issue. 

According to information we collected so far using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account from some proxy servers works, but when the same account is used from other proxy servers - then FSAA scan fails (such as in case of FRBBI-IMS02 proxy for example). 
As we agreed, you will contact Networking team and provide this PowerShell Script to them as well as results of the tests we performed today. 

 

To continue, we also discussed this error message:
Failed to copy StealthAUDIT.lic file to base FSAA folder: Access is denied""

In previous tickets this issue was known to be resolved after restart of the StealthAudit console. As such, please, restart the StealthAudit console, then retry the FSAA scan that was failing with this error and let me know results. 
If the issue is still taking place - I will open a separate ticket for it to continue investigation. 

 

I am looking forward to hearing back from you!

Artem Naskal

Hello Saveetha, 

This is Artem, thank you for waiting. 
We have prepared a PowerShell script for testing access to IPC$ share of the target NetApp host from Proxy server for use with ""GLOGALs-stealthnetapp"" account. 
I would like to suggest scheduling a meeting where we can discuss how script works and perform test using it together so that you can relay this information later on to your team. 

Please, use this link to schedule meeting with me at the available time:

Hello Saveetha, Fenil, 

Thank you very much for your time on a meeting today.
I am pleased to say that we made progress today because we isolated the issue to the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account.

Here is a recap of what we did today:

Allow me to describe an issue once more to make sure we cover all the details.
Currently you are experiencing an issue with FSAA permission scans for many NetApp hosts from GLOBAL and NHY domains. 
Each of the target NetApp host mentioned has their own corresponding Proxy server. 

Each of these proxy servers use the same connection profile:
GLOBAL NETAPP

This connection profile consists of these two service accounts:
GLOBALs-stealthnetapp (Active Directory Account) - this account is used to connect to target NetApp host from Proxy server.
NHYs01305proxy (StealthAudit task (Domain)) - this account is used to connect to Proxy from Stealth Audit server using Secure RPC.

On today`s remote session we checked required network ports and WMI connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers.
Ports 445 and 135 are opened and WMI connection test was successful as well.

Also, we confirmed that connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers using ""NHYs01305proxy"" account for ""Secure RPC"" works successfully.
Both Job and FSAA applet logs indicate that connection from Stealth Audit to Proxy can be successfully established when ""NHYs01305proxy"" account is used and ""Use secure RPC connection"" checkbox is enabled in Job Query settings.

However, issue appears when Proxy service tries to connect to target NetApp host using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to enumerate NetApp`s shares.
As such, in order to resolve this issue, you need to find out why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account leads to the error ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" when this account is used from the Proxy servers in question to connect to NetApp target hosts affected by the issue.

We agreed that you will contact Network and NetApp teams to clarify why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is failing to connect to target NetApp hosts from corresponding Proxy servers to access/enumerate available shares. 
In the meantime, we will clarify which isolation test can display issue with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account outside of StealthAudit.  

Please, let me know once you have news from your side. 
And I will reach out to you as soon as I have an update. 

Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
Thank you! 

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Artem,

 

Affected element is NetApp which uses below mentioned IMS servers as proxy.
We have shared the respective IMS servers of problematic NetApp.
And also, We can have a meeting scheduled, to get to know the issue in detail which will be easier for investigation.

Hi Saveetha, 

Please, accept my apologies for a delayed reply. Thank you very much for the provided details. 

Allow me additional time to finalize my analysis of the logs provided. Logs will allow me to narrow down scope of the issue and isolate the root cause. 
I will get back to you with a more detailed update by tomorrow. 

I just wanted to ask if you could help me clarify one detail about the list of affected servers. 
In the list of affected servers there are ""IMS Servers"" as well. If I remember correctly - these are Proxy servers that are used for scanning target NetApp hosts. 
Is this correct? Could you clarify if these IMS servers are all Enterprise Auditor FSAA proxy servers?:

	Hi Artem, 

	 
	
	
	Currently several FSAA scans for both NHY and GLOBAL domains are affected by the issue, is that correct? 

	Not several. Some of the Netapps affected with this error message. 
	
	
	What steps to troubleshoot this issue have already been taken?

	Reconfigured job scan
	Re installed SA proxy in respective IMS servers
	Re added the Netapp host in host management. 
	Verified ports are opened. 
	
	 Have you checked connectivity between FSAA scan Proxy server and StealthAudit host with network team? 
	Yes, we verified the port connectivity from source to destination. 
	 
	
	The FSAA scan jobs for NHY and GLOBAL were configured a long time ago and previously were running successfully. As such, can you contact NHY and GLOBAL domain admins to check with them if there were any changes applied to domains? 
	Some netapps not working from the time it was configured. Some were stopped working for past few weeks. 
	 
	When was the last time these FSAA scan jobs run successfully? What is the Date and Time of the last successful run?
	It depends on each netapps. Most probably last three to five scans were failed. 


These are the affected host

Hello Saveetha, 

Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support.

This is Artem, I will be assisting you with this ticket as your lead technical support representative.
I am sorry to hear that this issue is affecting many target servers, I will assist you with resolving this issue as soon as possible. 

Please, note instructions bellow. This information is very important to start our troubleshooting process efficiently and confidently.
Without this information we will have to spend additional time to get it before we are able to continue troubleshooting.
Please, make sure to provide as much details as possible.   

First of all, allow me to clarify additional details, this will help me understand issue better:


	Currently several FSAA scans for both NHY and GLOBAL domains are affected by the issue, is that correct? 
	What steps to troubleshoot this issue have already been taken? Have you checked connectivity between FSAA scan Proxy server and StealthAudit host with network team? 
	The FSAA scan jobs for NHY and GLOBAL were configured a long time ago and previously were running successfully. As such, can you contact NHY and GLOBAL domain admins to check with them if there were any changes applied to domains? 
	When was the last time these FSAA scan jobs run successfully? What is the Date and Time of the last successful run? 


To continue, if my understanding is correct, these are the affected target hosts:
From GLOBAL domain:
BBI01-NS012
CAKENICS-OFS012
CARUAICS-OFS012
MAG01-NS012
USSPDICS-OFS012

From NHY domain:
PSG00-NS012
DKTO3PV-NAO012
FIN00-NS012

As such, please, provide names of the FSAA scan jobs that are scanning these hosts and failing.
Also, provide the host name of the FSAA scan proxy server that is configured to scan these hosts. If there are multiple proxy servers that are scanning these hosts - please, provide thee full list of FSAA Scan Proxy servers. 
 

And last but not least, please, export support logs for the FSAA scan jobs that are failing with the ""Error during processing: Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol"".

Hello Saveetha, Fenil,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we discussed:

NetAPP team has provided access to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account in NetAPP.
We need to understand which permissions were provided to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account by your team to continue troubleshooting.

Please, contact NetAPP and Networking team and request them to provide screenshots which can show how access was provided, and which permissions exactly were provided to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account from NetAPP side.

We also discussed that the ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$<file://TargetNetAppHost/IPC$>"" error can be caused due to NHY domain configuration. As such, I would suggest checking domain group policy configuration to see if there is something that could prevent IMS02 proxies from accessing and enumerating shares on the GLOBAL and NHY NetAPP hosts.

In the meantime, I will consult with my team to see if we can suggest any other isolation tests for the ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$<file://TargetNetAppHost/IPC$>"" error besides previously provided PowerShell script.

Artem Naskal

Hello Saveetha,

I have not heard back from you after our last meeting and wanted to ask if you had an update from Networking team.
Did Networking team had any questions or updates based on the tests we performed during our last meeting using GLOBALs-stealthnetapp account and the PowerShell script?

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Hello Saveetha, Fenil,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of today`s meeting for your records:

Using a PowerShell script that is attached to this email we tested connection to IPC$ share of the Target NetApp hosts from Proxy servers.
The test was performed using credentials of the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account - because this is the account that the FSAA scans are configured to use.

First, we performed test for the FRBBI site for which FSAA scan is failing, where Proxy is FRBBI-IMS02 and target NetApp is BBI01-NS012.
Using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account the PowerShell script could not connect to \BBI01-NS012IPC$<file://BBI01-NS012/IPC$> share:
[cid:image005.png@01DB9371.C4E633D0]

The same issue is happening during FSAA scan - the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is used from FRBBI-IMS02 proxy.
But the scan is failing with ""Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol"" because FRBBI-IMS02 proxy cannot connect to IPC$ share of the BBI01-NS012 target using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"".

We also performed the same test but for proxy servers and target NetApp hosts for which the FSAA scan is successful.
Using PowerShell script and ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account we successfully connected to IPC$ share of the target NetApp hosts for which scan runs successfully:
DEIDUICS-OFS012:
[cid:image006.png@01DB9371.C4E633D0]

ACM01-NS012:
[cid:image007.png@01DB9371.C4E633D0]

Results of these tests performed with script correlate with results of the FSAA scans in StealthAudit.
As such, the script can be used by your Networking team as a valid tool for troubleshooting of the issue.

According to information we collected so far using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account from some proxy servers works, but when the same account is used from other proxy servers - then FSAA scan fails (such as in case of FRBBI-IMS02 proxy for example).
As we agreed, you will contact Networking team and provide this PowerShell Script to them as well as results of the tests we performed today.



To continue, we also discussed this error message:
Failed to copy StealthAUDIT.lic file to base FSAA folder: Access is denied""

In previous tickets this issue was known to be resolved after restart of the StealthAudit console. As such, please, restart the StealthAudit console, then retry the FSAA scan that was failing with this error and let me know results.
If the issue is still taking place - I will open a separate ticket for it to continue investigation.



I am looking forward to hearing back from you!

Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hello Saveetha, Fenil,

Thank you very much for your time on a meeting today.
I am pleased to say that we made progress today because we isolated the issue to the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account.

Here is a recap of what we did today:

Allow me to describe an issue once more to make sure we cover all the details.
Currently you are experiencing an issue with FSAA permission scans for many NetApp hosts from GLOBAL and NHY domains.
Each of the target NetApp host mentioned has their own corresponding Proxy server.

Each of these proxy servers use the same connection profile:
GLOBAL NETAPP

This connection profile consists of these two service accounts:
GLOBALs-stealthnetapp (Active Directory Account) - this account is used to connect to target NetApp host from Proxy server.
NHYs01305proxy (StealthAudit task (Domain)) - this account is used to connect to Proxy from Stealth Audit server using Secure RPC.

On today`s remote session we checked required network ports and WMI connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers.
Ports 445 and 135 are opened and WMI connection test was successful as well.

Also, we confirmed that connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers using ""NHYs01305proxy"" account for ""Secure RPC"" works successfully.
Both Job and FSAA applet logs indicate that connection from Stealth Audit to Proxy can be successfully established when ""NHYs01305proxy"" account is used and ""Use secure RPC connection"" checkbox is enabled in Job Query settings.

However, issue appears when Proxy service tries to connect to target NetApp host using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to enumerate NetApp`s shares.
As such, in order to resolve this issue, you need to find out why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account leads to the error ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$<file://TargetNetAppHost/IPC$>"" when this account is used from the Proxy servers in question to connect to NetApp target hosts affected by the issue.

We agreed that you will contact Network and NetApp teams to clarify why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is failing to connect to target NetApp hosts from corresponding Proxy servers to access/enumerate available shares.
In the meantime, we will clarify which isolation test can display issue with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account outside of StealthAudit.

Please, let me know once you have news from your side.
And I will reach out to you as soon as I have an update.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.
Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Saveetha,

Please, accept my apologies for a delayed reply. Thank you very much for the provided details.

Allow me additional time to finalize my analysis of the logs provided. Logs will allow me to narrow down scope of the issue and isolate the root cause.
I will get back to you with a more detailed update by tomorrow.

I just wanted to ask if you could help me clarify one detail about the list of affected servers.
In the list of affected servers there are ""IMS Servers"" as well. If I remember correctly - these are Proxy servers that are used for scanning target NetApp hosts.
Is this correct? Could you clarify if these IMS servers are all Enterprise Auditor FSAA proxy servers?:
GLOBAL
-------------------------------------------
 IMS SERVERS
FRBBIPV-IMS02
CAKENPV-IMS02
CARUAPV-IMS02
NOMAGPV-IMS02
USSPDPV-IMS02

NHY

IMS SERVERS
FRBDCPV-IMS02
DKTO1PV-IMS02

  *   Hi Artem,


  *   Currently several FSAA scans for both NHY and GLOBAL domains are affected by the issue, is that correct?
Not several. Some of the Netapps affected with this error message.

  *   What steps to troubleshoot this issue have already been taken?
Reconfigured job scan
Re installed SA proxy in respective IMS servers
Re added the Netapp host in host management.
Verified ports are opened.

 Have you checked connectivity between FSAA scan Proxy server and StealthAudit host with network team?
Yes, we verified the port connectivity from source to destination.


  *   The FSAA scan jobs for NHY and GLOBAL were configured a long time ago and previously were running successfully. As such, can you contact NHY and GLOBAL domain admins to check with them if there were any changes applied to domains?
Some netapps not working from the time it was configured. Some were stopped working for past few weeks.

  *   When was the last time these FSAA scan jobs run successfully? What is the Date and Time of the last successful run?
It depends on each netapps. Most probably last three to five scans were failed.
These are the affected host
GLOBAL

Hello Saveetha,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support.

This is Artem, I will be assisting you with this ticket as your lead technical support representative.
I am sorry to hear that this issue is affecting many target servers, I will assist you with resolving this issue as soon as possible.

Please, note instructions bellow. This information is very important to start our troubleshooting process efficiently and confidently.
Without this information we will have to spend additional time to get it before we are able to continue troubleshooting.
Please, make sure to provide as much details as possible.

First of all, allow me to clarify additional details, this will help me understand issue better:

  *   Currently several FSAA scans for both NHY and GLOBAL domains are affected by the issue, is that correct?
  *   What steps to troubleshoot this issue have already been taken? Have you checked connectivity between FSAA scan Proxy server and StealthAudit host with network team?
  *   The FSAA scan jobs for NHY and GLOBAL were configured a long time ago and previously were running successfully. As such, can you contact NHY and GLOBAL domain admins to check with them if there were any changes applied to domains?
  *   When was the last time these FSAA scan jobs run successfully? What is the Date and Time of the last successful run?

To continue, if my understanding is correct, these are the affected target hosts:
From GLOBAL domain:
BBI01-NS012
CAKENICS-OFS012
CARUAICS-OFS012
MAG01-NS012
USSPDICS-OFS012

From NHY domain:
PSG00-NS012
DKTO3PV-NAO012
FIN00-NS012

As such, please, provide names of the FSAA scan jobs that are scanning these hosts and failing.
Also, provide the host name of the FSAA scan proxy server that is configured to scan these hosts. If there are multiple proxy servers that are scanning these hosts - please, provide thee full list of FSAA Scan Proxy servers.


And last but not least, please, export support logs for the FSAA scan jobs that are failing with the ""Error during processing: Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol"".
Right click on the Job or Job Group experiencing problems and select Export.

Thank you for sharing this information with us. 

I have consulted with my team and would like to suggest you additional troubleshooting steps. 
These tests will allow you to check if NetAPP FSAA Scan port requirements are met or not:

1. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:


2. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

3. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Hello Saveetha, Fenil, 

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 
Here is a recap of what we discussed:

NetAPP team has provided access to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account in NetAPP.
We need to understand which permissions were provided to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account by your team to continue troubleshooting. 

Please, contact NetAPP and Networking team and request them to provide screenshots which can show how access was provided, and which permissions exactly were provided to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account from NetAPP side.

We also discussed that the ""Failed to connect to  \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" error can be caused due to NHY domain configuration. As such, I would suggest checking domain group policy configuration to see if there is something that could prevent IMS02 proxies from accessing and enumerating shares on the GLOBAL and NHY NetAPP hosts. 

In the meantime, I will consult with my team to see if we can suggest any other isolation tests for the ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" error besides previously provided PowerShell script.

Hello Saveetha, 

I have not heard back from you after our last meeting and wanted to ask if you had an update from Networking team. 
Did Networking team had any questions or updates based on the tests we performed during our last meeting using GLOBALs-stealthnetapp account and the PowerShell script? 

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Hello Saveetha, Fenil, 

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 
Here is a recap of today`s meeting for your records:

Using a PowerShell script that is attached to this email we tested connection to IPC$ share of the Target NetApp hosts from Proxy servers. 
The test was performed using credentials of the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account - because this is the account that the FSAA scans are configured to use. 

First, we performed test for the FRBBI site for which FSAA scan is failing, where Proxy is FRBBI-IMS02 and target NetApp is BBI01-NS012. 
Using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account the PowerShell script could not connect to \BBI01-NS012IPC$ share:


The same issue is happening during FSAA scan - the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is used from FRBBI-IMS02 proxy.
But the scan is failing with ""Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol"" because FRBBI-IMS02 proxy cannot connect to IPC$ share of the BBI01-NS012 target using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"". 

We also performed the same test but for proxy servers and target NetApp hosts for which the FSAA scan is successful.
Using PowerShell script and ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account we successfully connected to IPC$ share of the target NetApp hosts for which scan runs successfully:
DEIDUICS-OFS012:


ACM01-NS012:


Results of these tests performed with script correlate with results of the FSAA scans in StealthAudit.
As such, the script can be used by your Networking team as a valid tool for troubleshooting of the issue. 

According to information we collected so far using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account from some proxy servers works, but when the same account is used from other proxy servers - then FSAA scan fails (such as in case of FRBBI-IMS02 proxy for example). 
As we agreed, you will contact Networking team and provide this PowerShell Script to them as well as results of the tests we performed today. 

 

To continue, we also discussed this error message:
Failed to copy StealthAUDIT.lic file to base FSAA folder: Access is denied""

In previous tickets this issue was known to be resolved after restart of the StealthAudit console. As such, please, restart the StealthAudit console, then retry the FSAA scan that was failing with this error and let me know results. 
If the issue is still taking place - I will open a separate ticket for it to continue investigation. 

 

I am looking forward to hearing back from you!

Artem Naskal

Hello Saveetha, Fenil, 

Thank you very much for your time on a meeting today.
I am pleased to say that we made progress today because we isolated the issue to the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account.

Here is a recap of what we did today:

Allow me to describe an issue once more to make sure we cover all the details.
Currently you are experiencing an issue with FSAA permission scans for many NetApp hosts from GLOBAL and NHY domains. 
Each of the target NetApp host mentioned has their own corresponding Proxy server. 

Each of these proxy servers use the same connection profile:
GLOBAL NETAPP

This connection profile consists of these two service accounts:
GLOBALs-stealthnetapp (Active Directory Account) - this account is used to connect to target NetApp host from Proxy server.
NHYs01305proxy (StealthAudit task (Domain)) - this account is used to connect to Proxy from Stealth Audit server using Secure RPC.

On today`s remote session we checked required network ports and WMI connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers.
Ports 445 and 135 are opened and WMI connection test was successful as well.

Also, we confirmed that connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers using ""NHYs01305proxy"" account for ""Secure RPC"" works successfully.
Both Job and FSAA applet logs indicate that connection from Stealth Audit to Proxy can be successfully established when ""NHYs01305proxy"" account is used and ""Use secure RPC connection"" checkbox is enabled in Job Query settings.

However, issue appears when Proxy service tries to connect to target NetApp host using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to enumerate NetApp`s shares.
As such, in order to resolve this issue, you need to find out why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account leads to the error ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" when this account is used from the Proxy servers in question to connect to NetApp target hosts affected by the issue.

We agreed that you will contact Network and NetApp teams to clarify why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is failing to connect to target NetApp hosts from corresponding Proxy servers to access/enumerate available shares. 
In the meantime, we will clarify which isolation test can display issue with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account outside of StealthAudit.  

Please, let me know once you have news from your side. 
And I will reach out to you as soon as I have an update. 

Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
Thank you! 

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Artem,



 



Affected element is NetApp which uses below mentioned IMS servers as proxy.
We have shared the respective IMS servers of problematic NetApp.
And also, We can have a meeting scheduled, to get to know the issue in detail which will be easier for investigation.

Hi Saveetha, 

Please, accept my apologies for a delayed reply. Thank you very much for the provided details. 

Allow me additional time to finalize my analysis of the logs provided. Logs will allow me to narrow down scope of the issue and isolate the root cause. 
I will get back to you with a more detailed update by tomorrow. 

I just wanted to ask if you could help me clarify one detail about the list of affected servers. 
In the list of affected servers there are ""IMS Servers"" as well. If I remember correctly - these are Proxy servers that are used for scanning target NetApp hosts. 
Is this correct? Could you clarify if these IMS servers are all Enterprise Auditor FSAA proxy servers?:

GLOBAL

 IMS SERVERS

FRBBIPV-IMS02

CAKENPV-IMS02

CARUAPV-IMS02

	Hi Artem, 




 




	Currently several FSAA scans for both NHY and GLOBAL domains are affected by the issue, is that correct? 




Not several. Some of the Netapps affected with this error message. 




	What steps to troubleshoot this issue have already been taken?




Reconfigured job scan
Re installed SA proxy in respective IMS servers
Re added the Netapp host in host management. 
Verified ports are opened. 

 Have you checked connectivity between FSAA scan Proxy server and StealthAudit host with network team? 
Yes, we verified the port connectivity from source to destination. 
 



	The FSAA scan jobs for NHY and GLOBAL were configured a long time ago and previously were running successfully. As such, can you contact NHY and GLOBAL domain admins to check with them if there were any changes applied to domains? 
	Some netapps not working from the time it was configured. Some were stopped working for past few weeks. 
	 
	When was the last time these FSAA scan jobs run successfully? What is the Date and Time of the last successful run?
	It depends on each netapps. Most probably last three to five scans were failed. 


These are the affected host

Hello Saveetha,

Thank you for sharing this information with us.

I have consulted with my team and would like to suggest you additional troubleshooting steps.
These tests will allow you to check if NetAPP FSAA Scan port requirements are met or not:

1. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:
[Image_2025-03-12_20-36-25.png]

2. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

3. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Hello Saveetha, Fenil,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we discussed:

NetAPP team has provided access to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account in NetAPP.
We need to understand which permissions were provided to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account by your team to continue troubleshooting.

Please, contact NetAPP and Networking team and request them to provide screenshots which can show how access was provided, and which permissions exactly were provided to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account from NetAPP side.

We also discussed that the ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" error can be caused due to NHY domain configuration. As such, I would suggest checking domain group policy configuration to see if there is something that could prevent IMS02 proxies from accessing and enumerating shares on the GLOBAL and NHY NetAPP hosts.

In the meantime, I will consult with my team to see if we can suggest any other isolation tests for the ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" error besides previously provided PowerShell script.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Saveetha, Fenil,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of today`s meeting for your records:

Using a PowerShell script that is attached to this email we tested connection to IPC$ share of the Target NetApp hosts from Proxy servers.
The test was performed using credentials of the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account - because this is the account that the FSAA scans are configured to use.

First, we performed test for the FRBBI site for which FSAA scan is failing, where Proxy is FRBBI-IMS02 and target NetApp is BBI01-NS012.
Using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account the PowerShell script could not connect to \BBI01-NS012IPC$ share:
[cid:54ba4632-c8b6-44ab-8553-45c4bf7cb552@Image_6_]

The same issue is happening during FSAA scan - the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is used from FRBBI-IMS02 proxy.
But the scan is failing with ""Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol"" because FRBBI-IMS02 proxy cannot connect to IPC$ share of the BBI01-NS012 target using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"".

We also performed the same test but for proxy servers and target NetApp hosts for which the FSAA scan is successful.
Using PowerShell script and ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account we successfully connected to IPC$ share of the target NetApp hosts for which scan runs successfully:
DEIDUICS-OFS012:
[cid:f393f45d-d372-46e9-bbe7-313e90f13469@Image_7_]

ACM01-NS012:
[cid:f13d957a-e6ea-4088-90bf-0c2493d262fa@Image_8_]

Results of these tests performed with script correlate with results of the FSAA scans in StealthAudit.
As such, the script can be used by your Networking team as a valid tool for troubleshooting of the issue.

According to information we collected so far using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account from some proxy servers works, but when the same account is used from other proxy servers - then FSAA scan fails (such as in case of FRBBI-IMS02 proxy for example).
As we agreed, you will contact Networking team and provide this PowerShell Script to them as well as results of the tests we performed today.



To continue, we also discussed this error message:
Failed to copy StealthAUDIT.lic file to base FSAA folder: Access is denied""

In previous tickets this issue was known to be resolved after restart of the StealthAudit console. As such, please, restart the StealthAudit console, then retry the FSAA scan that was failing with this error and let me know results.
If the issue is still taking place - I will open a separate ticket for it to continue investigation.



I am looking forward to hearing back from you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Saveetha, Fenil,

Thank you very much for your time on a meeting today.
I am pleased to say that we made progress today because we isolated the issue to the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account.

Here is a recap of what we did today:

Allow me to describe an issue once more to make sure we cover all the details.
Currently you are experiencing an issue with FSAA permission scans for many NetApp hosts from GLOBAL and NHY domains.
Each of the target NetApp host mentioned has their own corresponding Proxy server.

Each of these proxy servers use the same connection profile:
GLOBAL NETAPP

This connection profile consists of these two service accounts:
GLOBALs-stealthnetapp (Active Directory Account) - this account is used to connect to target NetApp host from Proxy server.
NHYs01305proxy (StealthAudit task (Domain)) - this account is used to connect to Proxy from Stealth Audit server using Secure RPC.

On today`s remote session we checked required network ports and WMI connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers.
Ports 445 and 135 are opened and WMI connection test was successful as well.

Also, we confirmed that connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers using ""NHYs01305proxy"" account for ""Secure RPC"" works successfully.
Both Job and FSAA applet logs indicate that connection from Stealth Audit to Proxy can be successfully established when ""NHYs01305proxy"" account is used and ""Use secure RPC connection"" checkbox is enabled in Job Query settings.

However, issue appears when Proxy service tries to connect to target NetApp host using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to enumerate NetApp`s shares.
As such, in order to resolve this issue, you need to find out why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account leads to the error ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" when this account is used from the Proxy servers in question to connect to NetApp target hosts affected by the issue.

We agreed that you will contact Network and NetApp teams to clarify why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is failing to connect to target NetApp hosts from corresponding Proxy servers to access/enumerate available shares.
In the meantime, we will clarify which isolation test can display issue with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account outside of StealthAudit.

Please, let me know once you have news from your side.
And I will reach out to you as soon as I have an update.

Looking forward to hearing back from you.
Thank you!

Hello Artem,



Affected element is NetApp which uses below mentioned IMS servers as proxy.
We have shared the respective IMS servers of problematic NetApp.
And also, We can have a meeting scheduled, to get to know the issue in detail which will be easier for investigation.

Hi Saveetha,

Please, accept my apologies for a delayed reply. Thank you very much for the provided details.

Allow me additional time to finalize my analysis of the logs provided. Logs will allow me to narrow down scope of the issue and isolate the root cause.
I will get back to you with a more detailed update by tomorrow.

I just wanted to ask if you could help me clarify one detail about the list of affected servers.
In the list of affected servers there are ""IMS Servers"" as well. If I remember correctly - these are Proxy servers that are used for scanning target NetApp hosts.
Is this correct? Could you clarify if these IMS servers are all Enterprise Auditor FSAA proxy servers?:

GLOBAL
-------------------------------------------
 IMS SERVERS

FRBBIPV-IMS02

CAKENPV-IMS02

CARUAPV-IMS02

  *   Hi Artem,



  *   Currently several FSAA scans for both NHY and GLOBAL domains are affected by the issue, is that correct?

Not several. Some of the Netapps affected with this error message.

  *   What steps to troubleshoot this issue have already been taken?

Reconfigured job scan
Re installed SA proxy in respective IMS servers
Re added the Netapp host in host management.
Verified ports are opened.

 Have you checked connectivity between FSAA scan Proxy server and StealthAudit host with network team?
Yes, we verified the port connectivity from source to destination.


  *   The FSAA scan jobs for NHY and GLOBAL were configured a long time ago and previously were running successfully. As such, can you contact NHY and GLOBAL domain admins to check with them if there were any changes applied to domains?
Some netapps not working from the time it was configured. Some were stopped working for past few weeks.

  *   When was the last time these FSAA scan jobs run successfully? What is the Date and Time of the last successful run?
It depends on each netapps. Most probably last three to five scans were failed.

These are the affected host

Hello Saveetha, 

Thank you for sharing this information with us. 

I have consulted with my team and would like to suggest you additional troubleshooting steps. 
These tests will allow you to check if NetAPP FSAA Scan port requirements are met or not:

1. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:


2. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

3. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy  servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Hello Saveetha, Fenil, 

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 
Here is a recap of what we discussed:

NetAPP team has provided access to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account in NetAPP.
We need to understand which permissions were provided to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account by your team to continue troubleshooting. 

Please, contact NetAPP and Networking team and request them to provide screenshots which can show how access was provided, and which permissions exactly were provided to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account from NetAPP side.

We also discussed that the ""Failed to connect to  \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" error can be caused due to NHY domain configuration. As such, I would suggest checking domain group policy configuration to see if there is something that could prevent IMS02 proxies from accessing and enumerating shares on the GLOBAL and NHY NetAPP hosts. 

In the meantime, I will consult with my team to see if we can suggest any other isolation tests for the ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" error besides previously provided PowerShell script.

Hello Saveetha, 

I have not heard back from you after our last meeting and wanted to ask if you had an update from Networking team. 
Did Networking team had any questions or updates based on the tests we performed during our last meeting using GLOBALs-stealthnetapp account and the PowerShell script? 

Looking forward to hearing back from you.

Hello Saveetha, Fenil, 

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 
Here is a recap of today`s meeting for your records:

Using a PowerShell script that is attached to this email we tested connection to IPC$ share of the Target NetApp hosts from Proxy servers. 
The test was performed using credentials of the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account - because this is the account that the FSAA scans are configured to use. 

First, we performed test for the FRBBI site for which FSAA scan is failing, where Proxy is FRBBI-IMS02 and target NetApp is BBI01-NS012. 
Using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account the PowerShell script could not connect to \BBI01-NS012IPC$ share:


The same issue is happening during FSAA scan - the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is used from FRBBI-IMS02 proxy.
But the scan is failing with ""Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol"" because FRBBI-IMS02 proxy cannot connect to IPC$ share of the BBI01-NS012 target using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"". 

We also performed the same test but for proxy servers and target NetApp hosts for which the FSAA scan is successful.
Using PowerShell script and ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account we successfully connected to IPC$ share of the target NetApp hosts for which scan runs successfully:
DEIDUICS-OFS012:


ACM01-NS012:


Results of these tests performed with script correlate with results of the FSAA scans in StealthAudit.
As such, the script can be used by your Networking team as a valid tool for troubleshooting of the issue. 

According to information we collected so far using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account from some proxy servers works, but when the same account is used from other proxy servers - then FSAA scan fails (such as in case of FRBBI-IMS02 proxy for example). 
As we agreed, you will contact Networking team and provide this PowerShell Script to them as well as results of the tests we performed today. 

 

To continue, we also discussed this error message:
Failed to copy StealthAUDIT.lic file to base FSAA folder: Access is denied""

In previous tickets this issue was known to be resolved after restart of the StealthAudit console. As such, please, restart the StealthAudit console, then retry the FSAA scan that was failing with this error and let me know results. 
If the issue is still taking place - I will open a separate ticket for it to continue investigation. 

 

I am looking forward to hearing back from you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hello Saveetha, 

This is Artem, thank you for waiting. 
We have prepared a PowerShell script for testing access to IPC$ share of the target NetApp host from Proxy server for use with ""GLOGALs-stealthnetapp"" account. 
I would like to suggest scheduling a meeting where we can discuss how script works and perform test using it together so that you can relay this information later on to your team. 

Please, use this link to schedule meeting with me at the available time:

Hello Saveetha, Fenil, 

Thank you very much for your time on a meeting today.
I am pleased to say that we made progress today because we isolated the issue to the ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account.

Here is a recap of what we did today:

Allow me to describe an issue once more to make sure we cover all the details.
Currently you are experiencing an issue with FSAA permission scans for many NetApp hosts from GLOBAL and NHY domains. 
Each of the target NetApp host mentioned has their own corresponding Proxy server. 

Each of these proxy servers use the same connection profile:
GLOBAL NETAPP

This connection profile consists of these two service accounts:
GLOBALs-stealthnetapp (Active Directory Account) - this account is used to connect to target NetApp host from Proxy server.
NHYs01305proxy (StealthAudit task (Domain)) - this account is used to connect to Proxy from Stealth Audit server using Secure RPC.

On today`s remote session we checked required network ports and WMI connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers.
Ports 445 and 135 are opened and WMI connection test was successful as well.

Also, we confirmed that connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers using ""NHYs01305proxy"" account for ""Secure RPC"" works successfully.
Both Job and FSAA applet logs indicate that connection from Stealth Audit to Proxy can be successfully established when ""NHYs01305proxy"" account is used and ""Use secure RPC connection"" checkbox is enabled in Job Query settings.

However, issue appears when Proxy service tries to connect to target NetApp host using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to enumerate NetApp`s shares.
As such, in order to resolve this issue, you need to find out why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account leads to the error ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" when this account is used from the Proxy servers in question to connect to NetApp target hosts affected by the issue.

We agreed that you will contact Network and NetApp teams to clarify why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account is failing to connect to target NetApp hosts from corresponding Proxy servers to access/enumerate available shares. 
In the meantime, we will clarify which isolation test can display issue with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account outside of StealthAudit.  

Please, let me know once you have news from your side. 
And I will reach out to you as soon as I have an update. 

Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
Thank you! 

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hello Artem,



 



Affected element is NetApp which uses below mentioned IMS servers as proxy.
We have shared the respective IMS servers of problematic NetApp.
And also, We can have a meeting scheduled, to get to know the issue in detail which will be easier for investigation.

Hi Saveetha, 

Please, accept my apologies for a delayed reply. Thank you very much for the provided details. 

Allow me additional time to finalize my analysis of the logs provided. Logs will allow me to narrow down scope of the issue and isolate the root cause. 
I will get back to you with a more detailed update by tomorrow. 

I just wanted to ask if you could help me clarify one detail about the list of affected servers. 
In the list of affected servers there are ""IMS Servers"" as well. If I remember correctly - these are Proxy servers that are used for scanning target NetApp hosts. 
Is this correct? Could you clarify if these IMS servers are all Enterprise Auditor FSAA proxy servers?:

GLOBAL

 IMS SERVERS

FRBBIPV-IMS02

CAKENPV-IMS02

CARUAPV-IMS02

IMS SERVERS

FRBDCPV-IMS02

DKTO1PV-IMS02

	Hi Artem, 




 




	Currently several FSAA scans for both NHY and GLOBAL domains are affected by the issue, is that correct? 




Not several. Some of the Netapps affected with this error message. 




	What steps to troubleshoot this issue have already been taken?




Reconfigured job scan
Re installed SA proxy in respective IMS servers
Re added the Netapp host in host management. 
Verified ports are opened. 

 Have you checked connectivity between FSAA scan Proxy server and StealthAudit host with network team? 
Yes, we verified the port connectivity from source to destination. 
 



	The FSAA scan jobs for NHY and GLOBAL were configured a long time ago and previously were running successfully. As such, can you contact NHY and GLOBAL domain admins to check with them if there were any changes applied to domains? 
	Some netapps not working from the time it was configured. Some were stopped working for past few weeks. 
	 
	When was the last time these FSAA scan jobs run successfully? What is the Date and Time of the last successful run?
	It depends on each netapps. Most probably last three to five scans were failed. 


These are the affected host

Thank you for getting back to us with an update. 

This ticket is for troubleshooting FSAA scan error when using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" to access NetAPP hosts shares. 
Last time we suggested to either use a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares. 
Or perform these additional tests to see if network requirements are met:
 

1. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:


2. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

3. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts. 


Could you let me know, do you have status for that? Have you tried steps above with your Networking team?

Hello Artem,

We have followed the steps outlined, and the issue seems to be related to NAME RESOLUTION. When using the FQDN with port 445, the test is successful. However, when using only the NetApp name (without the FQDN), the test fails.

[cid:a8564e52-dd88-47fe-90b3-2f2245c86fed]
For other working NetApps, the NetApp name alone is sufficient, and the test succeeds. We believe the problematic NetApp should behave the same way and work with just the NetApp name, without requiring the FQDN.[cid:c0bad152-64ad-4e54-b20f-b381793dec32]
Could you please provide insight into the cause or advise on the next steps?

Thank you for the update and for clarifying all these details.

The Host name resolution and Test-NetConnection on port 445 only works if you are using FQDN for the problematic NetApp hosts. If you are looking to resolve this and make problematic NetAPP host available with Hostname only - then you need to contact your NetAPP and networking team who are responsible for this kind of configuration.
Contact them and provide them with information and screenshot you provided to us in the last email - this will be enough for them to start investigation and resolve this.

I also must point out, that even if you make problematic NetAPP host available via Hostname only - you still need to make sure that ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account.

As such, I would highly recommend contacting your Networking team and team responsible for configuring NetAPP hosts and ask them to assist you with resolving both issues:


	NetAPP hostname resolution without FQDN
	And making sure ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account

I have attached PowerShell script to this email.

For other working NetApps, the NetApp name alone is sufficient, and the test succeeds. We believe the problematic NetApp should behave the same way and work with just the NetApp name, without requiring the FQDN.[cid:6d4ae499-95c1-439c-9bf1-f4d890d7dcf8@Image_1_]
Could you please provide insight into the cause or advise on the next steps?

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for getting back to us with an update.

This ticket is for troubleshooting FSAA scan error when using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" to access NetAPP hosts shares.
Last time we suggested to either use a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares.
Or perform these additional tests to see if network requirements are met:


1. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:
[Image_2025-03-12_20-36-25.png]

2. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

3. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Could you let me know, do you have status for that? Have you tried steps above with your Networking team?

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for the update and for clarifying all these details.

The Host name resolution and Test-NetConnection on port 445 only works if you are using FQDN for the problematic NetApp hosts. If you are looking to resolve this and make problematic NetAPP host available with Hostname only - then you need to contact your NetAPP and networking team who are responsible for this kind of configuration.
Contact them and provide them with information and screenshot you provided to us in the last email - this will be enough for them to start investigation and resolve this.

I also must point out, that even if you make problematic NetAPP host available via Hostname only - you still need to make sure that ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account.

As such, I would highly recommend contacting your Networking team and team responsible for configuring NetAPP hosts and ask them to assist you with resolving both issues:

  *   NetAPP hostname resolution without FQDN
  *   And making sure ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account

I have attached PowerShell script to this email.

The following was provided from our side as a list of requirements that should be met in your environment for successful NetAPP host FSAA scan:

1. First of all, we suggested using a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares. 
You can find the script attached to this email.

Script must be run from the Proxy server and target NetAPP host. Script must also use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account as this is the account that is configured in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

To target different NetAPP hosts you need to modify the following variables inside the script:
$NetAppHost = ""10.62.3.153""
$SharePath = ""\$NetAppHostIPC$""

To use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account its credentials must be provided to this variable inside the script:
$Accounts = @(
    @{ Username = ""username""; Password = ""Password"" }
    @{ Username = ""domainusername""; Password = ""Password"" }
)

If script is not producing successful results - this means that you must engage your NetAPP team and possibly NetAPP support to resolve this issue. Script must run successfully to ensure successful FSAA Scan against NetAPP hosts.

Alternatively, these additional tests were suggested to see if network requirements are met:

2. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:


3. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

4. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Hello Artem, 

 

We have followed the steps outlined, and the issue seems to be related to NAME RESOLUTION. When using the FQDN with port 445, the test is successful. However, when using only the NetApp name (without the FQDN), the test fails.


For other working NetApps, the NetApp name alone is sufficient, and the test succeeds. We believe the problematic NetApp should behave the same way and work with just the NetApp name, without requiring the FQDN.

Could you please provide insight into the cause or advise on the next steps?

Hi Saveetha, 

Thank you for getting back to us with an update. 

This ticket is for troubleshooting FSAA scan error when using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" to access NetAPP hosts shares. 
Last time we suggested to either use a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares. 
Or perform these additional tests to see if network requirements are met:
 

1. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:


2. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

3. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts. 


Could you let me know, do you have status for that? Have you tried steps above with your Networking team?

Hi Saveetha, 

The following was provided from our side as a list of requirements that should be met in your environment for successful NetAPP host FSAA scan:

1. First of all, we suggested using a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares. 
You can find the script attached to this email.

Script must be run from the Proxy server and target NetAPP host. Script must also use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account as this is the account that is configured in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

To target different NetAPP hosts you need to modify the following variables inside the script:
$NetAppHost = ""10.62.3.153""
$SharePath = ""\$NetAppHostIPC$""

To use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account its credentials must be provided to this variable inside the script:
$Accounts = @(
    @{ Username = ""username""; Password = ""Password"" }
    @{ Username = ""domainusername""; Password = ""Password"" }
)

If script is not producing successful results - this means that you must engage your NetAPP team and possibly NetAPP support to resolve this issue. Script must run successfully to ensure successful FSAA Scan against NetAPP hosts.

Alternatively, these additional tests were suggested to see if network requirements are met:

2. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:


3. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

4. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Hi Saveetha, 

Thank you for the update and for clarifying all these details.

The Host name resolution and Test-NetConnection on port 445 only works if you are using FQDN for the problematic NetApp hosts. If you are looking to resolve this and make problematic NetAPP host available with Hostname only - then you need to contact your NetAPP and networking team who are responsible for this kind of configuration.
Contact them and provide them with information and screenshot you provided to us in the last email - this will be enough for them to start investigation and resolve this.

I also must point out, that even if you make problematic NetAPP host available via Hostname only - you still need to make sure that ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account.

As such, I would highly recommend contacting your Networking team and team responsible for configuring NetAPP hosts and ask them to assist you with resolving both issues:


	NetAPP hostname resolution without FQDN
	And making sure ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account


I have attached PowerShell script to this email.

Hi Saveetha,

The following was provided from our side as a list of requirements that should be met in your environment for successful NetAPP host FSAA scan:

1. First of all, we suggested using a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares.
You can find the script attached to this email.

Script must be run from the Proxy server and target NetAPP host. Script must also use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account as this is the account that is configured in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

To target different NetAPP hosts you need to modify the following variables inside the script:
$NetAppHost = ""10.62.3.153""
$SharePath = ""\$NetAppHostIPC$""

To use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account its credentials must be provided to this variable inside the script:
$Accounts = @(
    @{ Username = ""username""; Password = ""Password"" }
    @{ Username = ""domainusername""; Password = ""Password"" }
)

If script is not producing successful results - this means that you must engage your NetAPP team and possibly NetAPP support to resolve this issue. Script must run successfully to ensure successful FSAA Scan against NetAPP hosts.

Alternatively, these additional tests were suggested to see if network requirements are met:

2. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:
[Image_2025-03-12_20-36-25.png]

3. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

4. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for the update and for clarifying all these details.

The Host name resolution and Test-NetConnection on port 445 only works if you are using FQDN for the problematic NetApp hosts. If you are looking to resolve this and make problematic NetAPP host available with Hostname only - then you need to contact your NetAPP and networking team who are responsible for this kind of configuration.
Contact them and provide them with information and screenshot you provided to us in the last email - this will be enough for them to start investigation and resolve this.

I also must point out, that even if you make problematic NetAPP host available via Hostname only - you still need to make sure that ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account.

As such, I would highly recommend contacting your Networking team and team responsible for configuring NetAPP hosts and ask them to assist you with resolving both issues:

  *   NetAPP hostname resolution without FQDN
  *   And making sure ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account

I have attached PowerShell script to this email.

Hello Artem,

We have followed the steps outlined, and the issue seems to be related to NAME RESOLUTION. When using the FQDN with port 445, the test is successful. However, when using only the NetApp name (without the FQDN), the test fails.

[cid:956f8982-734a-4ae0-8278-b9999c486596@Image_3_]
For other working NetApps, the NetApp name alone is sufficient, and the test succeeds. We believe the problematic NetApp should behave the same way and work with just the NetApp name, without requiring the FQDN.[cid:128216e2-dc75-4df9-8256-6e0692fcc9ea@Image_4_]
Could you please provide insight into the cause or advise on the next steps?

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for getting back to us with an update.

This ticket is for troubleshooting FSAA scan error when using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" to access NetAPP hosts shares.
Last time we suggested to either use a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares.
Or perform these additional tests to see if network requirements are met:


1. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:
[Image_2025-03-12_20-36-25.png]

2. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

3. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Could you let me know, do you have status for that? Have you tried steps above with your Networking team?

Hi Artem, 

 

We have requested our DNS team to create DNS record in both domain for the problematic server. If that works, we can conclude that issue has been resolved. We are waiting for the DNS team response on this. Until then, please place the ticket on hold.

Hi Saveetha, 

The following was provided from our side as a list of requirements that should be met in your environment for successful NetAPP host FSAA scan:

1. First of all, we suggested using a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares. 
You can find the script attached to this email.

Script must be run from the Proxy server and target NetAPP host. Script must also use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account as this is the account that is configured in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

To target different NetAPP hosts you need to modify the following variables inside the script:
$NetAppHost = ""10.62.3.153""
$SharePath = ""\$NetAppHostIPC$""

To use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account its credentials must be provided to this variable inside the script:
$Accounts = @(
    @{ Username = ""username""; Password = ""Password"" }
    @{ Username = ""domainusername""; Password = ""Password"" }
)

If script is not producing successful results - this means that you must engage your NetAPP team and possibly NetAPP support to resolve this issue. Script must run successfully to ensure successful FSAA Scan against NetAPP hosts.

Alternatively, these additional tests were suggested to see if network requirements are met:

2. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:


3. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

4. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Hi Saveetha, 

Thank you for the update and for clarifying all these details.

The Host name resolution and Test-NetConnection on port 445 only works if you are using FQDN for the problematic NetApp hosts. If you are looking to resolve this and make problematic NetAPP host available with Hostname only - then you need to contact your NetAPP and networking team who are responsible for this kind of configuration.
Contact them and provide them with information and screenshot you provided to us in the last email - this will be enough for them to start investigation and resolve this.

I also must point out, that even if you make problematic NetAPP host available via Hostname only - you still need to make sure that ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account.

As such, I would highly recommend contacting your Networking team and team responsible for configuring NetAPP hosts and ask them to assist you with resolving both issues:


	NetAPP hostname resolution without FQDN

Hi Artem,

We have requested our DNS team to create DNS record in both domain for the problematic server. If that works, we can conclude that issue has been resolved. We are waiting for the DNS team response on this. Until then, please place the ticket on hold.

Hi Saveetha,

The following was provided from our side as a list of requirements that should be met in your environment for successful NetAPP host FSAA scan:

1. First of all, we suggested using a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares.
You can find the script attached to this email.

Script must be run from the Proxy server and target NetAPP host. Script must also use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account as this is the account that is configured in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

To target different NetAPP hosts you need to modify the following variables inside the script:
$NetAppHost = ""10.62.3.153""
$SharePath = ""\$NetAppHostIPC$""

To use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account its credentials must be provided to this variable inside the script:
$Accounts = @(
    @{ Username = ""username""; Password = ""Password"" }
    @{ Username = ""domainusername""; Password = ""Password"" }
)

If script is not producing successful results - this means that you must engage your NetAPP team and possibly NetAPP support to resolve this issue. Script must run successfully to ensure successful FSAA Scan against NetAPP hosts.

Alternatively, these additional tests were suggested to see if network requirements are met:

2. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:
[Image_2025-03-12_20-36-25.png]

3. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

4. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for the update and for clarifying all these details.

The Host name resolution and Test-NetConnection on port 445 only works if you are using FQDN for the problematic NetApp hosts. If you are looking to resolve this and make problematic NetAPP host available with Hostname only - then you need to contact your NetAPP and networking team who are responsible for this kind of configuration.
Contact them and provide them with information and screenshot you provided to us in the last email - this will be enough for them to start investigation and resolve this.

I also must point out, that even if you make problematic NetAPP host available via Hostname only - you still need to make sure that ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account.

As such, I would highly recommend contacting your Networking team and team responsible for configuring NetAPP hosts and ask them to assist you with resolving both issues:

  *   NetAPP hostname resolution without FQDN
  *   And making sure ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account

I have attached PowerShell script to this email.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Lb1Ne:ref



Hello Artem,

We have followed the steps outlined, and the issue seems to be related to NAME RESOLUTION. When using the FQDN with port 445, the test is successful. However, when using only the NetApp name (without the FQDN), the test fails.

[cid:7e263fe2-6da1-451a-aab5-fe174ff026ac@Image_4_]
For other working NetApps, the NetApp name alone is sufficient, and the test succeeds. We believe the problematic NetApp should behave the same way and work with just the NetApp name, without requiring the FQDN.[cid:533f1ec5-1193-4c03-824b-02a8d2fb61bc@Image_5_]
Could you please provide insight into the cause or advise on the next steps?

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for getting back to us with an update.

This ticket is for troubleshooting FSAA scan error when using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" to access NetAPP hosts shares.
Last time we suggested to either use a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares.
Or perform these additional tests to see if network requirements are met:


1. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:
[Image_2025-03-12_20-36-25.png]

2. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

3. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Could you let me know, do you have status for that? Have you tried steps above with your Networking team?

Thank you for the prompt reply.
I am happy to hear that this resolved the issue for you! This is great news.

The following is a recap of the ticket for your records:

Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly known as Enterprise Auditor) FSAA scans could not start against some NetAPP hosts in NHY and Global domain.

After performing multiple troubleshooting steps and tests it was found that the following Test-NetConnection command is failing against NetAPP hosts with issue when only hostname is used:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

Command could run successfully for other NetAPP hosts when only hostname is used, but for those NetAPP hosts that were having issues in Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) - the same command was failing when only target host name is used.

After adding needed DNS server records issue was resolved for previously failing NetAPP hosts.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return.
In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Hi Artem, 

 

We have requested our DNS team to create DNS record in both domain for the problematic server. If that works, we can conclude that issue has been resolved. We are waiting for the DNS team response on this. Until then, please place the ticket on hold.

Hi Saveetha, 

The following was provided from our side as a list of requirements that should be met in your environment for successful NetAPP host FSAA scan:

1. First of all, we suggested using a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares. 
You can find the script attached to this email.

Script must be run from the Proxy server and target NetAPP host. Script must also use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account as this is the account that is configured in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.

To target different NetAPP hosts you need to modify the following variables inside the script:
$NetAppHost = ""10.62.3.153""
$SharePath = ""\$NetAppHostIPC$""

To use ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account its credentials must be provided to this variable inside the script:
$Accounts = @(
    @{ Username = ""username""; Password = ""Password"" }
    @{ Username = ""domainusername""; Password = ""Password"" }
)

If script is not producing successful results - this means that you must engage your NetAPP team and possibly NetAPP support to resolve this issue. Script must run successfully to ensure successful FSAA Scan against NetAPP hosts.

Alternatively, these additional tests were suggested to see if network requirements are met:

2. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:


3. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

4. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts.

Hello Artem, 

 

WORKING NETAPP: 
Source : NLANLPV-IMS02

Destination: NLANLICS-OFS012


	
	Access has been granted for both the account ""NHYs01305proxy"" and ""Globals-stealthnetapp"". Verified using IPC script provided by Netwrix.  
	
	
	Two DNS record has been created. One in NHy domain and Other in Global.to Domain. 
	3) Port 445 is opened.
	 
	


 

NOT WORKING NETAPP: 
Source: USAYSPV-IMS02

Destination: USAYSICS-OFS012


	
	Access has been granted for both the account ""NHYs01305proxy"" and ""Globals-stealthnetapp"". Verified using IPC script provided by Netwrix.  
	
	
	Only one DNS record exist in Global.to Domain.
	
	
	Port 445 is opened.

	 
	


What would be the Netwrix suggestion in this case?

Hi Saveetha, 

Thank you for the update and for clarifying all these details.

The Host name resolution and Test-NetConnection on port 445 only works if you are using FQDN for the problematic NetApp hosts. If you are looking to resolve this and make problematic NetAPP host available with Hostname only - then you need to contact your NetAPP and networking team who are responsible for this kind of configuration.
Contact them and provide them with information and screenshot you provided to us in the last email - this will be enough for them to start investigation and resolve this.

I also must point out, that even if you make problematic NetAPP host available via Hostname only - you still need to make sure that ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account.

As such, I would highly recommend contacting your Networking team and team responsible for configuring NetAPP hosts and ask them to assist you with resolving both issues:


	NetAPP hostname resolution without FQDN
	And making sure ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script runs successfully from the problematic Proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" user account


I have attached PowerShell script to this email.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Lb1Ne:ref
 

 

Hello Artem, 

 

We have followed the steps outlined, and the issue seems to be related to NAME RESOLUTION. When using the FQDN with port 445, the test is successful. However, when using only the NetApp name (without the FQDN), the test fails.


For other working NetApps, the NetApp name alone is sufficient, and the test succeeds. We believe the problematic NetApp should behave the same way and work with just the NetApp name, without requiring the FQDN.

Could you please provide insight into the cause or advise on the next steps?

Hi Saveetha, 

Thank you for getting back to us with an update. 

This ticket is for troubleshooting FSAA scan error when using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" to access NetAPP hosts shares. 
Last time we suggested to either use a PowerShell script that performs a ""netuse"" command with ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to one of the NetAPP shares. 
Or perform these additional tests to see if network requirements are met:
 

1. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings:


2. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" - contact your networking team and ask them to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand.

3. Next, perform Test-NetConnection command check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy server, which are IMS02 servers in your environment.
<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing.

If ""Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445"" that is executed on IMS02 Proxy is failing - then contact your networking team and ask them to allow port 445 (for SMB connection) between StealthAudit FSAA Proxy Server to NetAPP hosts. 


Could you let me know, do you have status for that? Have you tried steps above with your Networking team?
