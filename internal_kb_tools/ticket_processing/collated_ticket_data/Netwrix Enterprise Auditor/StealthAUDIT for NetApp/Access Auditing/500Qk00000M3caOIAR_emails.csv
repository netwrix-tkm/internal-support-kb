Thank you for the update! I am glad to hear that I was able to help you resolve your request.  

The following is a summary of the ticket for your records




""FS_OpenAccess"" report is created by analyzing all FSAA related information from NEA database.
It is not possible to provide a list of specific hosts for ""FS_OpenAccess"" report. Instead, this report is created based on the data for all hosts that were scanned during FSAA permission scan jobs. 

As such the hosts that will end up in the default built-in ""Open Access"" report - are those hosts, data for whom exists in the NEA database. 

This is why it was suggested creating a separate job which will remove data for decommissioned NetApp hosts - because once data for such hosts is removed, then future reports generated by ""FS_OpenAccess"" job will no longer reflect information about such hosts. This is the best practice for such scenario. 

This is why we discussed that to remove the decommissioned NetApp hosts from the Open Access report we first need to remove such NetApp hosts from StealthAudit database. 

As such, using steps from this KB article:
How to Drop Data for Decommissioned File Servers
we created a new job which removes data for desire NetApp hosts for you from the database. 

This new job consists of two tasks:


	a query which removes data related to hosts specified in ""Hosts"" settings of the job. 
	and an analysis task that selects all hosts from SA_FSAA_Hosts table: this analysis is used to check which hosts are still in Stealth Audit database. It can be used for checking if the host was removed successfully. 


However, ther is an alternative method to remove decomissioned NetApp hosts from final report. 

It is possible to create a custom report based on ""FS_OpenAccess"" job report.
Within this custom report you can filter out NetApp hosts that are decommissioned. This means that information for old, decommissioned NetApp hosts will still be present in Database, but instead of running job to remove that data - you can create a custom report that will filter out unnecessary hosts. 

FS_OpenAccess job has 4 different reports that are generated as a result:


You need to decide which report you would like to customize. 

Then create a copy of this report and customize it as described in this article:
Creating a Report
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return.
In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did.
Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

This is Artem with 00436257 - How to remove decommissioned netapp from Netapp open access report? ticket.
As we discussed on our meeting today, please, reply back to Iliya to the ticket ""00438421 - Discrepancy in netapp open access report."" and share results of these steps:

Please check the effective access for any of these folders. 


	Right-click on the problematic folder.
	Click Properties > Security tab.
	Click Advanced.
	Go to the Effective Access tab.
	Click Select a user and type in Everyone (or a specific user they claim has access).
	Click View Effective Access.


After doing that you can check NTFS level permissions as well:


	Check Share Permissions

	
		Open Run (Win + R), type fsmgmt.msc, and hit Enter.
		Locate the shared folder and right-click > Properties.
		Go to the Share Permissions tab.
		Look for ""Everyone"" and see if it has permissions.
	
	
	Check NTFS (File System) Permissions
	
		Open the folder location in File Explorer.
		Right-click the folder > Properties > Security tab.
		Check if ""Everyone"" exists in the list.
		Click Advanced and see if it appears in inherited permissions.
	
	


Regarding Temp$:
Special administrative shares like Temp$ might have default permissions that don’t always show in standard checks. Please note that ""Everyone"" is a default security principal in Windows and may show up regardless of permissions granted.

 

This ticket will be closed as it was regarding removal of decommissioned NetApp hosts from Open Access report.

Hi Artem, 

 

Could you answer this question please?

In the NetApp open access report, some NetApp temporary folders indicate ""Everyone"" access. However, upon logging in, it appears that this access is not actually present. Please refer to the attached screenshot and document for details.

 

Could you clarify what ""Everyone"" means in the Trustee Name column? Does it imply that the NetApp folder truly grants access to ""Everyone""?
