Hi Saqib,

Thanks for that link. I will have a read.

Another job that just resulted in an error was:
Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAAScanProcess|Tier 1 database schema is not up to date, run the FileSystem Create Schema job

Do you know how I run this job ? I can't see it in the job tree.

Hi Saqib,

I don't believe I have a File System0.CreateSchema job to run.

Is there a way I can create it or perhaps the position of it has changed from version 11 to 12 ?

I have attached a screenshot of my job tree.

Do you know how I run this job ? I can't see it in the job tree.

Hi Saqib,

The job execution timeout expired.

I ran the command as advised and there was a message about not ""cannot find the object... because it does not exist or you do not have permissions""
I have attached a screenshot of the window including the message.

I believe from setup of 11.6 I have admin privileges on the SQL server/database.

Hi Saqib,

Thanks for that link. I will have a read.

Another job that just resulted in an error was:
Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAAScanProcess|Tier 1 database schema is not up to date, run the FileSystem Create Schema job

Do you know how I run this job ? I can't see it in the job tree.

Hi Saqib,

 

The job execution timeout expired.

 

I ran the command as advised and there was a message about not “cannot find the object… because it does not exist or you do not have permissions”

I have attached a screenshot of the window including the message.

 

I believe from setup of 11.6 I have admin privileges on the SQL server/database.

Hello Matthew,

Please cancel the FileSystem0.Collection0-Create Schema job, navigate to SQL Server Management Studio and run these commands:
 



ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


Re-run the FileSystem0.Collection0-Create Schema job. Once completed, navigate back to SQL Server Management Studio and run these commands:
 




 


ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


Please share your findings afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

I have found it in the job tree under: FileSystem0.Collection0-Create Schema

 

I have started the job, it is still running.


I will advise once it’s completed and I have ran a new job manually to verify if any errors occur.

Hi Saqib,

 

I have booked our catch-up for 2pm today.

If too soon, then please let me know.

 

Also I am only able to screen share on MS Teams so let me know if you can join a MS Teams meeting and we can have that capability otherwise I can join on your Zoom link and talk on there and discuss without screen sharing.

Hi Saqib,

 

The job execution timeout expired.

 

I ran the command as advised and there was a message about not “cannot find the object… because it does not exist or you do not have permissions”

I have attached a screenshot of the window including the message.

 

I believe from setup of 11.6 I have admin privileges on the SQL server/database.

 

Regards,

Hello Matthew,

Please cancel the FileSystem0.Collection0-Create Schema job, navigate to SQL Server Management Studio and run these commands:
 



ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;



 


ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


Re-run the FileSystem0.Collection0-Create Schema job. Once completed, navigate back to SQL Server Management Studio and run these commands:
 




 



 


 



 


ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;



 


ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


Please share your findings afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

The job execution timeout expired.

 

I ran the command as advised and there was a message about not “cannot find the object… because it does not exist or you do not have permissions”

I have attached a screenshot of the window including the message.

 

I believe from setup of 11.6 I have admin privileges on the SQL server/database.

Hello Matthew,

Please cancel the FileSystem0.Collection0-Create Schema job, navigate to SQL Server Management Studio and run these commands:
 



ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


 


ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


Re-run the FileSystem0.Collection0-Create Schema job. Once completed, navigate back to SQL Server Management Studio and run these commands:
 



 


 


 


 


ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


 


ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


Please share your findings afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,


Thanks for that link. I will have a read.

 

Another job that just resulted in an error was:

Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAAScanProcess|Tier 1 database schema is not up to date, run the FileSystem Create Schema job

 

Do you know how I run this job ? I can’t see it in the job tree.

Hi Saqib,

I have booked our catch-up for 2pm today.
If too soon, then please let me know.

Hi Saqib,

The job execution timeout expired.

I ran the command as advised and there was a message about not ""cannot find the object... because it does not exist or you do not have permissions""
I have attached a screenshot of the window including the message.

I believe from setup of 11.6 I have admin privileges on the SQL server/database.

Hello Matthew,

Please cancel the FileSystem0.Collection0-Create Schema job, navigate to SQL Server Management Studio and run these commands:




ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;







ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
Re-run the FileSystem0.Collection0-Create Schema job. Once completed, navigate back to SQL Server Management Studio and run these commands:




















ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;







ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
Please share your findings afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

I have found it in the job tree under: FileSystem0.Collection0-Create Schema

I have started the job, it is still running.

I will advise once it's completed and I have ran a new job manually to verify if any errors occur.

Hi Saqib,

Thanks for that link. I will have a read.

Another job that just resulted in an error was:
Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAAScanProcess|Tier 1 database schema is not up to date, run the FileSystem Create Schema job

Do you know how I run this job ? I can't see it in the job tree.

Hello Matthew,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
checked the error that was popping when running the Create-Schema job. To resolve that issue, we opened SQL Server Management Studio and identified the full path to DB tables to be used. We modified the commands as follows:
 



ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails] NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourceMap] NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;



Similarly, the other set of SQL queries was also modified to:
 




 


ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails] WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourceMap] WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;



The first set of commands was run but there was already a scheduled job running and it was taking very long.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Since there was a scheduled job running, it was decided that you will run the first set of commands, execute the create schema job.


To go through the process tomorrow once the scheduled jobs complete, please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience:

Hi Saqib,

 

The job execution timeout expired.

 

I ran the command as advised and there was a message about not “cannot find the object… because it does not exist or you do not have permissions”

I have attached a screenshot of the window including the message.

 

I believe from setup of 11.6 I have admin privileges on the SQL server/database.

I have started the job, it is still running.


I will advise once it’s completed and I have ran a new job manually to verify if any errors occur.

Hi Saqib,


Thanks for that link. I will have a read.

 

Another job that just resulted in an error was:

Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAAScanProcess|Tier 1 database schema is not up to date, run the FileSystem Create Schema job

 

Do you know how I run this job ? I can’t see it in the job tree.

Hello Matthew,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
checked the error that was popping when running the Create-Schema job. To resolve that issue, we opened SQL Server Management Studio and identified the full path to DB tables to be used. We modified the commands as follows:
 



ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails] NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourceMap] NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;



Similarly, the other set of SQL queries was also modified to:
 



 


ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails] WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;


ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourceMap] WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;



The first set of commands was run but there was already a scheduled job running and it was taking very long.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Since there was a scheduled job running, it was decided that you will run the first set of commands, execute the create schema job.


To go through the process tomorrow once the scheduled jobs complete, please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience:

Hi Saqib,

 

Here is column 1 text for ‘Query’:
INSERT INTO [dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourceMap]

        ([HOST], [ID], [AccessID], [ActivityID], [DLPID])

      SELECT 

        [HOST], [ID], [AccessID], [ActivityID], [DLPID]

      FROM [dbo].[SA_FSAA_Resources] Old

      WHERE Old.HOST = @CurrHost

        AND Old.ID >= @StartID

        AND Old.ID < @EndID

      ORDER BY Old.HOST, Old.ID

 

And the screenshot of the other columns data:

Hi Saqib,

 

I have found it in the job tree under: FileSystem0.Collection0-Create Schema

 

I have started the job, it is still running.


I will advise once it’s completed and I have ran a new job manually to verify if any errors occur.

 

Regards,

Hi Matthew,

For that error, please run this job File System0.CreateSchema and the error will go away.

Hi Saqib,


Thanks for that link. I will have a read.

 

Another job that just resulted in an error was:

Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAAScanProcess|Tier 1 database schema is not up to date, run the FileSystem Create Schema job

 

Do you know how I run this job ? I can’t see it in the job tree.

 

Regards,
