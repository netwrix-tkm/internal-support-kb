Have FSAA scan configured with remote Proxy as a service with Secure RPC
FSAA proxy and target NetApp hosts are located in different domains. 
FSAA scan periodically fails with:
Error during processing: Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol""","Customer is getting this error during NetApp FSAA scans:
Error during processing: Cannot connect to server with any selected protocol""

Affected target hosts:

From GLOBAL domain: 
BBI01-NS012 
CAKENICS-OFS012
CARUAICS-OFS012

USSPDICS-OFS012

From NHY domain:
PSG00-NS012
DKTO3PV-NAO012

Each of the target hosts mentioned above have their own corresponding Proxy servers, which are the following:
GLOBAL
-------------------------------------------
 IMS SERVERS
FRBBIPV-IMS02
CAKENPV-IMS02
CARUAPV-IMS02
NOMAGPV-IMS02
USSPDPV-IMS02
 
NHY
-------------------------------------------
IMS SERVERS
FRBDCPV-IMS02
DKTO1PV-IMS02
SEMYRPV-IMS02

Each of these proxies use this connection profile:
GLOBAL NETAPP

Connection profle consists of these two service account:
GLOBALs-stealthnetapp (Active Directory Account)
NHYs01305proxy (StealthAudit task (Domain))

On today`s remote session we checked required network ports and wmi connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy server. 
ports 445 and 135 are openned and WMI connection test was successful as well. 

Also, we confirmed that connection between StealthAudit server and Proxy servers using ""NHYs01305proxy"" account for ""Secure RPC"" works successfully. Both Job and FSAA applet logs indicate that connection from Stealth Audit to Proxy can be successfully established. 

However, issue appears when Proxy service tries to connect to target NetApp host using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account to enumerate NetApp shares. 

As such, in order to resolve this issue, we need to figure out why ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account leads to the error ""Failed to connect to \TargetNetAppHostIPC$"" when this account is used from the Proxy servers in question to connect to NetApp target hosts. 

Case that is linked to this issue:
00431554 - FSAA scan error: Failed to connect to \BEWLDPV-APP002IPC$:

---------------------
17.02.2025 

Using script provided by Damir we tested access to IPC$ share via ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account for both failing and successful FSAA scan sites. 

Script clearly showed that ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account for some reason is failing to access IPC$ shares for some target hosts, but for other target hosts (for which FSAA scan is successful) it is working fine. 

This proves that issue is outside of StealthAudit product and is caused by combination of User Account and Proxy server/Target NetApp. 

Customer will contact Networking team, provide them with PowerShell script and our test results, and ask them to assist with this issue.

Customer asked for additional time to check the issue with networking and security teams.

12.03.2025

Had a meeting with Saveetha. 
She said that NetAPp and Networking team has ""provided access"" to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account in NetAPP but the issue is still there. 

I asked Saveetha to provide screenshots of what exactly NetAPP team did and how this ""access"" was provided to ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account. 

In the meantime, I will check if we can come up with some other isolation tests besides ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script. 
(netapp IPC$ check.zip is available on the ticket share for reference)

--------------
12.03.2025 update

As per conversation with team customer should check if these NetAPP FSAA port requirements are met:
1. In FSAA System Scan query settings check the Scan Settings > NetApp communication security settings. 

2. Depending on what is set in ""NetApp communication security settings"" Kyndryl then needs to check either port 443 (for HTTPS) or port 80 (for HTTP) between NEA server and target NetAPP host affected by the issue at hand. 

3. Next, Kyndryl must perform this tnc check from IMS02 Proxy servers from which scan is failing to the NetAPP host affected by the issue:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

This command must be run from Proxy.<hostname> must be the hostname of the target NetAPP for which scan is failing. 

If all of the above is successful - then they need to rerun the ""netapp IPC$ check"" PowerShell script from IMS02 proxy using ""GLOBALs-stealthnetapp"" account. 

If PowerShell script still fails (and script does ""netuse"" for NetAPP IPC$ share using provided creds) - then issue is 100% withing their environment, it is outside of NEA and there is nothing else we can check from our side.","Customer will reply back to us once they have an update from their Networking team.","Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly known as Enterprise Auditor) FSAA scans could not start against some NetAPP hosts in NHY and Global domain. 

After performing multiple troubleshooting steps and tests it was found that the following Test-NetConnection command is failing against NetAPP hosts with issue when only hostname is used:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <hostname> -Port 445

Command could run successfully for other NetAPP hosts when only hostname is used, but for those NetAPP hosts that were having issues in Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) - the same command was failing when only target host name is used.

After adding needed DNS server records issue was resolved for previously failing NetAPP hosts.","Network Connectivity","Artem Naskal","Error","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for NetApp","Access Auditing","11.5","","67.0","Closed - Resolved","Hydro Group Norway","saveetha Anesh","2025-02-07T12:04:34.000Z","2025-04-15T12:51:10.000Z"
