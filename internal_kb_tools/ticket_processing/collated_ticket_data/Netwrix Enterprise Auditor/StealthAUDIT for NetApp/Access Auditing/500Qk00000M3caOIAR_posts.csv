End customer of Kyndryl wants to remove decommissioned NetApp hosts from Open Access report. 

As such, suggested Kyndryl that a job to remove decommissioned NetApp hosts data needs to be created. 

We created job on a remote session using steps from this KB:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000001qvpKAA.html

I left remote session when the new job`s query was still running.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-02-20T10:57:39.000Z"
