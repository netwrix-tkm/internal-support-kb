Could not use view or function 'SA_FS_BrokenInheritance_UniqueTrustees' because of binding errors.""","I saw this was reported in case 00382569. The solution in this case was to replace the job with an older version. I confirmed this did work, but the version shipping out of the box is having this error in some environments.

ERROR DataAnalysis:SQLScripting ExecuteNonQuery ""Invalid object name 'SA_FS_BrokenInheritance_Details'. Could not use view or function 'SA_FS_BrokenInheritance_UniqueTrustees' because of binding errors.""

I could not reproduce this in my lab. Investigating the issue at the customers it appeared the #tmpPaths and the permissionsCompaison table both had data.","BSW: a product fix has been released","Running the new out of the box version of the SA_FS_BrokenInheritance_Details results in error messages.  Using a copy from my 11.0 lab this ran fine.  I took this resolution from another support ticket so I know other customers are running into this too.  I tried to replicate this in my lab with the same version the customer was running and I could not replicate.","Upgrade customer to latest NEA/SA and remove all pre-existing tables/views with prefix FS_BrokenInheritance","The issue should be resolved by the customer upgrading to the latest version of 11.6 and dropping any table in the database with the prefix ""FS_BrokenInheritance"".

Customer has terminated their contract so they will not be upgrading.","Product defect","Tay Caliguiri","Error","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for NetApp","Access Auditing","11.5","11.5","193.9","Closed - Resolved","Continental Resources, Inc.","Phi Tran","2024-09-25T18:53:09.000Z","2025-04-07T16:34:15.000Z"
