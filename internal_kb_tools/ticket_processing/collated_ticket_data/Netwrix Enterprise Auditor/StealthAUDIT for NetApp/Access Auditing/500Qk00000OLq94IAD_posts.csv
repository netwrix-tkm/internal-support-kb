I had a meeting with the customer. We identified if the tables referenced in the SQL query exist or not. They did exist and we modified the query accordingly. We ran it, however, there was a scheduled job already running and we decided to meet tomorrow to complete the process.","","","","005Qk00000214EvIAI","2025-04-28T04:30:51.000Z"
