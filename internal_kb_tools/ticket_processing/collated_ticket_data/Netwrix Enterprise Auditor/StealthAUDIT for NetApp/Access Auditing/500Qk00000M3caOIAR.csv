How to remove decommissioned netapp from Netapp open access report?","","--------
20.02.2025 

End customer of Kyndryl wants to remove decommissioned NetApp hosts from Open Access report. 

As such, suggested Kyndryl that a job to remove decommissioned NetApp hosts data needs to be created. 

We created job on a remote session using steps from this KB:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000001qvpKAA.html

I left remote session when the new job`s query was still running.","Customer will re-run ""Open Access"" job to generate a new report after data for decommissioned Net App hosts is removed from stealth audit database.","""FS_OpenAccess"" report is created by analyzing all FSAA related information from NEA database.
It is not possible to provide a list of specific hosts for ""FS_OpenAccess"" report. Instead, this report is created based on the data for all hosts that were scanned during FSAA permission scan jobs. 

As such the hosts that will end up in the default built-in ""Open Access"" report - are those hosts, data for whom exists in the NEA database. 

This is why it was suggested creating a separate job which will remove data for decommissioned NetApp hosts - because once data for such hosts is removed, then future reports generated by ""FS_OpenAccess"" job will no longer reflect information about such hosts. This is the best practice for such scenario. 

This is why we discussed that to remove the decommissioned NetApp hosts from the Open Access report we first need to remove such NetApp hosts from StealthAudit database. 

As such, using steps from this KB article:
How to Drop Data for Decommissioned File Servers
we created a new job which removes data for desire NetApp hosts for you from the database. 

This new job consists of two tasks:

a query which removes data related to hosts specified in ""Hosts"" settings of the job. 
and an analysis task that selects all hosts from SA_FSAA_Hosts table: this analysis is used to check which hosts are still in Stealth Audit database. It can be used for checking if the host was removed successfully. 
However, ther is an alternative method to remove decomissioned NetApp hosts from final report. 

It is possible to create a custom report based on ""FS_OpenAccess"" job report.
Within this custom report you can filter out NetApp hosts that are decommissioned. This means that information for old, decommissioned NetApp hosts will still be present in Database, but instead of running job to remove that data - you can create a custom report that will filter out unnecessary hosts. 

FS_OpenAccess job has 4 different reports that are generated as a result:

You need to decide which report you would like to customize. 

Then create a copy of this report and customize it as described in this article:
