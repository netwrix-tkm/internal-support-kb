Furthremore, he is also getting Schema update error. They have been guided to run 0.Create Schema job

28/04/2025:
I had a meeting with the customer. We identified if the tables referenced in the SQL query exist or not. They did exist and we modified the query accordingly. We ran it, however, there was a scheduled job already running and we decided to meet tomorrow to complete the process.","In tomorrow's meeting, we will:
1. Run these commands:
ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails] NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourceMap] NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;

2. Run the Create Schema Job.

3. Once it finishes, run these commands:

ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails] WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourceMap] WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;","Symptom
After upgrading Netwrix Access Analyzer from v11.6.0.141 to v12.0.0.153, multiple jobs were failing with different errors:
 
GetFSACIniAttributeValue: Error: Ini section for [Windows file server] does not exist in ini file  \[Windows file server]C$ProgramDataNetwrixActivity MonitorAgent<a href='https://SBTFileMon.ini' target='_blank'>SBTFileMon.ini</a>

Unable to start scan: Proxy host list is either empty or no proxies were configured to scan the target host

Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAAScanProcess|Tier 1 database schema is not up to date, run the FileSystem Create Schema job

Resolution
For the first issue, this KB (Error: Ini Section Does Not Exist in SBTFileMon.ini) provided a solution.
The second issue was sorted out by upgrading the FSAA proxy agents installed on Windows Servers.
The third issue was resolved by running the following commands in SQL DB via SSMS console:
 
ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails] NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourceMap] NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
Afterwards, we ran the 0-Create Schema job which completed without any problems and then the other set of SQL queries was executed.
ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails] WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;
ALTER TABLE [DB_NAME].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourceMap] WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL;","Incorrect Configuration - Netwrix Product/System","Saqib Sharif","Error","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for NetApp","Access Auditing","12.0","12.0.0.153","14.9","Closed - Resolved","Thales Group Australia","Matthew Heaton-Harris","2025-04-23T05:58:37.000Z","2025-05-08T04:16:25.000Z"
