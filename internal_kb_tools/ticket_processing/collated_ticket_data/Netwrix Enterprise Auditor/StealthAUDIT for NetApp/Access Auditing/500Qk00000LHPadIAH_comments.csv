@Salesforce @Helen Randall - 
per discussion on the Technical Knowledge share, relaying guidance from dev on what to look out for if an issue like this comes up:

Below is what we have seen. Why the stacktrace relates to the issue is that SafeAccessTokenHandles are not being finalized, so when our code re-impersonates, there are none left. This could happen with other OS resources that have a limit however:


--- CODE ---
System.Security.SecurityException at
System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity.SafeImpersonate(Microsoft.Win32.SafeHandles.SafeAccessTokenHandle,
System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity, System.Threading.StackCrawlMark

@Salesforce  Update: A fix has been made that the dev team believes would help address this customer's issue. The fix is in the core area of the product

Due to the area of the code the fix is in, and due to the cumulative list of fixes that have been made between the version the customer is running and the available fix, we unfortunately cannot provide a hotfix for this issue. Because of this, customer must upgrade to a CU.  Prepping a build now. Should have a CU posted today.
