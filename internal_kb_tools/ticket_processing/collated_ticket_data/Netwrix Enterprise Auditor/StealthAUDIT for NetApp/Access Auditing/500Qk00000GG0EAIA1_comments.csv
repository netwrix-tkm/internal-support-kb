@Salesforce this one remains on the backlog. Currently P3s are unlikely to be looked at until 2025.

@Salesforce@Chris Brooks@Michael Burrofato @Michael Longo
I was not able to reproduce this issue. Can I ask that you
upgrade to the latest version and manually drop any object in tier1 that begins
with ""SA_FS_BrokenInheritance"". The job should handle that, but this
just ensures that you are starting fresh with the latest analysis. If the
problem persists, please provide the job log.

Do you mean drop a table from MSSQL that begins with ""SA_FS_BrokenInheritance""?

Or drop some record from a table?","0050g000006QqyEAAS","2025-03-25T20:27:48.000Z","2025-03-25T20:27:48.000Z","false","false"

@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer Good question. Please drop any Table or View that has that prefix in MSSQL, not individual records from a table.
Thanks!
