We believe the issue with the FS_BrokenInheritance job have been resolved. For our next steps, we'd like to upgrade to the latest version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor/StealthAUDIT and remove any pre-existing tables and views with the FS_BrokenInheritance prefix. The job does this anyways, but a clean slate never hurts.

Please use the link below to schedule a remote session for us to upgrade:

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=bp8ptQGW11GaE9kFsTC0K1cXXgrZsrHUW6kjDLYH.jA-Z&MeetingID=qh115Zgjf.Zta9ZrRtlWejiIsv2AHUAVOsLCqIe2Zzs-Z

Before the upgrade meeting, please complete the following:


	Take a backup/snapshot of the StealthAUDIT console server
	Take a backup/snapshot of the StealthAUDIT database
	Download the latest installers from the Netwrix Portal


Let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you,
Tay Caliguiri

Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Tay,

Thank you for reaching out and informing me about a potential fix to the broken inheritance job. However, I do not think applying the update will be necessary as our StealthAUDIT license expires at the end of April.

Thank you,

Hello Phi,

Looking forward to connecting with you!

Ticket Subject: Error Running Broken Inheritance Job ""Invalid object name 'SA_FS_BrokenInheritance_Details'. Could not use view or function 'SA_FS_BrokenInheritance_UniqueTrustees' because of binding errors.""
Ticket Details: I saw this was reported in case 00382569. The solution in this case was to replace the job with an older version. I confirmed this did work, but the version shipping out of the box is having this error in some environments.

ERROR DataAnalysis:SQLScripting ExecuteNonQuery ""Invalid object name 'SA_FS_BrokenInheritance_Details'. Could not use view or function 'SA_FS_BrokenInheritance_UniqueTrustees' because of binding errors.""

I could not reproduce this in my lab. Investigating the issue at the customers it appeared the #tmpPaths and the permissionsCompaison table both had data.

Thank you!

I'm sorry to hear you'll be leaving us. Would you like me to proceed with closing this ticket out then?

You do still have full support until the end of your contract date.
