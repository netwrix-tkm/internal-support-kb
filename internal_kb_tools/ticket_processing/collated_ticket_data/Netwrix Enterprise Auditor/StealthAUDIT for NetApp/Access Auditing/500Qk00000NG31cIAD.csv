FSAA System scan failed when there were 6 hosts left to scan.","Have 11.6.0.113 NEA installed. 
8 CPUs and 24 RAM on NEA server. 
Configure Host list for 120 NAS hosts. 
Scan this host list with FSAA system scan with 10 concurrent threads. 
Job failed with Out Of memory exception.","-----------
24.03.2025 
Customer reported that their FSAA System scan has failed for their NAS hosts with System.OutOfMemoryException error. 

Job finished processing almost all NAS hosts except for the last 6 hosts. 

Scan for these last 6 hosts failed with this error as seen in the job log:
19/03/2025 23:51:58	DEBUG	StealthAUDIT(TDispatch)	TDispatch.ExecuteJob	""Thread is waiting for work""	GL-9185-WNAS67P		5	11680	12872
20/03/2025 02:22:16	DEBUG	FILESYSTEMACCESS	AccessScanTask	""Scanned 5921k Objects [99.9%]""	MW-0775-WNAS20P	DCExtract	11812	11680	12872
20/03/2025 04:00:40	DEBUG	FILESYSTEMACCESS	AccessScanTask	""Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.""	JX-0245-WNAS00P	DCExtract	8992	11680	12872

this error then appears for each of the last 6 hosts. 

It looks like that the server which was selected as a Scanning Host simply run out of RAM while doing scan. 
If I remember correctly, all state uses Local Scan mode for File System. 
As such, most probably it was NEA server that run out of memory. 

Asked customer to provide additional details about FSAA job configuration and upload Windows Application events, Job Logs, Job Messages, and SADatabase logs folder from NEA server.

Affected NEA server is - A0775-APP2356-S. 

Customer upload windows application event logs from 18th of March instead of 20th of March when issue took place. 
Asked customer to re-upload. 

Also, asked customer to lower number of FSAA concurrent threads, then restart the FSAA system scan job for NAS hosts.

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.

We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

Customer will get back to us with results of the next FSAA system scan.","Customer will test FSAA system scan job after we changed page file settings and will get back to us with results.
Placing ticket into postponed reply to give customer additional time. Support will follow up with customer on Monday, 14th of April.","FSAA system scan job for the last 6 hosts failed with this error as seen in the job log:

It was confirmed that the root cause of this issue is lack of space for the Page file on the server.

Thus, we checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.
We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

After applying these changes we saw that FSAA system scan job no longer fails with ""Out Of memory"" errors.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix server","Artem Naskal","Error","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for NetApp","Access Auditing","11.6","11.6.0.113","22.9","Closed - Resolved","Allstate Insurance Company","Stealth Audit","2025-03-24T13:13:54.000Z","2025-04-16T10:37:51.000Z"
