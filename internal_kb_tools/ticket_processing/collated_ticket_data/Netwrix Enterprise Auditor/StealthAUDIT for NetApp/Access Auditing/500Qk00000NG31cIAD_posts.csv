24.03.2025 
Customer reported that their FSAA System scan has failed for their NAS hosts with System.OutOfMemoryException error. 

Job finished processing almost all NAS hosts except for the last 6 hosts. 

Scan for these last 6 hosts failed with this error as seen in the job log:
19/03/2025 23:51:58	DEBUG	StealthAUDIT(TDispatch)	TDispatch.ExecuteJob	""Thread is waiting for work""	GL-9185-WNAS67P		5	11680	12872

this error then appears for each of the last 6 hosts. 

It looks like that the server which was selected as a Scanning Host simply run out of RAM while doing scan. 
If I remember correctly, all state uses Local Scan mode for File System. 
As such, most probably it was NEA server that run out of memory. 

Asked customer to provide additional details about FSAA job configuration and upload Windows Application events, Job Logs, Job Messages, and SADatabase logs folder from NEA server.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-03-24T13:46:45.000Z"

We checked pagefile.sys settings for the A0775-APP2356-S and settings were set to default which means that page file was configured to be on C: drive.

We changed it to D: drive with ""System Managed"" settings and disabled page file for C: drive. We did the same for one more Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server too.

Customer will get back to us with results of the next FSAA system scan.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-04-01T09:40:34.000Z"
