This is only happening with one host. I am not sure how to go about finding what row in the database is causing this. The error is happening during the FSAA Bulk Import. Looking at the log, I don't know if other records for this host are getting imported or if the job fails at this point.","run the FSAA bulk import job","5-9   Applied hotfix today from development.

gathered logs and attached to ticket
-FSAA System Scan job export
-FSAA Bulk Import job export
-Proxy logs
-T2s from Proxy

copied T2s and client's bulk import job to my lab, targeted the host having issues (DRF-ERNIE2) and ran it
bulk imported without issue

Provided client with instructions to repair the database for that host","escalate ticket
