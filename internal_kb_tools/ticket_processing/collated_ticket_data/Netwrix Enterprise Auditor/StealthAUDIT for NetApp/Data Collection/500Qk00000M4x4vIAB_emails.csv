Hi Dusty,
                I checked the DRF-ERNIE2 permission scan job today and looks like it is running like it should. I renamed the ERNIE2 folder on the old proxy to see if a new one gets created on the next scan on Wednesday.

Hi Dusty,
                The scan job for ERNIE2 is successfully running. I will check again on Monday as it seems to run fine, then fail on the next scan.  I did see that another DRF-ERNIE2 folder was created again on the old proxy at the same time, 1:45 AM.

________________________________

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the last Ernie2 FSAA Scan completed as expected (11+hrs) from the manual kick off will see how the 2:30am auto run reports in the morning.
This should prove that the FSAADBs were updated on both host, as well see good time stamps on the files

We found that the Ernie2 folder was re-created at 1:45am Today (03062025) however we were not able to isolate which job created the empty folder.
Let me know if the Security Event log list out any of the folder modification.

Re-confirmed that the Proxy was induvial listed in each of the Groups scans

Confirmed within the SA_FSAA_Hosts table still list the LastScanHost as our expected Proxy.

Temp set the Run as in the schedule task as the domainService account (not other job have this).

If needed we can try for another meeting tomorrow after noon to drop all Ernie2 Tier 2 data and then rescan.

Again, thank You for your time.

Team,

Per our call today we looked at the FSAA Scan for ERNIE2.

Again noting that the Current Proxy is the Scn02 host.

Renamed the Tier 2s on the Scn Proxy for the host in question
Copied the only file that was not in sync for the Scan on proxy Scn02 over the local Tier 2s on the NEA server.

Temp set the Proxy host will want to set back to the Proxy host list  and disable the Affinity.

Kicked the FSAA Ernie2 scan off via the scheduled task.

Scan was over 500k objects at the end of the meeting.

Hi Dusty,
                I ran the ERNIE2 permission on Friday and it ran fine. The schedule kicked it off today with the same error message:
[cid:image003.png@01DB91D2.4391F440]

Still not sure why the schedule run doesn't work, but manually running the schedule does.  Hopefully we can figure out a fix for this on our meeting on Wednesday.

Hi Dusty,
                Looks like the work on the permission scan did not take.  ERNIE2 ran for only 8 minutes today with the following message:
[cid:image004.png@01DB91D2.4391F440]

I noticed on the console, there is still that file dated 1/24/2024.  I'm going to backup that file and run it manually, then wait until Monday to see if the automated scheduled job can run properly.

Hi Dusty,

                I checked the DRF-ERNIE2 permission scan job today and looks like it is running like it should. I renamed the ERNIE2 folder on the old proxy to see if a new one gets created on the next scan on Wednesday.

Hi Dusty,

                The scan job for ERNIE2 is successfully running. I will check again on Monday as it seems to run fine, then fail on the next scan.  I did see that another DRF-ERNIE2 folder was created again on the old proxy at the same time, 1:45 AM.

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the last Ernie2 FSAA Scan completed as expected (11+hrs) from the manual kick off will see how the 2:30am auto run reports in the morning.
This should prove that the FSAADBs were updated on both host, as well see good time stamps on the files

We found that the Ernie2 folder was re-created at 1:45am Today (03062025) however we were not able to isolate which job created the empty folder.
Let me know if the Security Event log list out any of the folder modification.

Re-confirmed that the Proxy was induvial listed in each of the Groups scans

Confirmed within the SA_FSAA_Hosts table still list the LastScanHost as our expected Proxy.

Temp set the Run as in the schedule task as the domainService account (not other job have this).

If needed we can try for another meeting tomorrow after noon to drop all Ernie2 Tier 2 data and then rescan.

Again, thank You for your time.

Team,

Per our call today we looked at the FSAA Scan for ERNIE2.

Again noting that the Current Proxy is the Scn02 host.

Renamed the Tier 2s on the Scn Proxy for the host in question
Copied the only file that was not in sync for the Scan on proxy Scn02 over the local Tier 2s on the NEA server.

Temp set the Proxy host will want to set back to the Proxy host list  and disable the Affinity.

Kicked the FSAA Ernie2 scan off via the scheduled task.

Scan was over 500k objects at the end of the meeting.

Hi Dusty,

                I ran the ERNIE2 permission on Friday and it ran fine. The schedule kicked it off today with the same error message:



 

Still not sure why the schedule run doesn’t work, but manually running the schedule does.  Hopefully we can figure out a fix for this on our meeting on Wednesday.

Hi Dusty,

                Looks like the work on the permission scan did not take.  ERNIE2 ran for only 8 minutes today with the following message:



 

I noticed on the console, there is still that file dated 1/24/2024.  I’m going to backup that file and run it manually, then wait until Monday to see if the automated scheduled job can run properly.

Hi Dusty,
                So far, looks like the permission scans for ERNIE2 are successful after you changed the settings.
[cid:image001.png@01DB9729.7F2B5080]

I checked the errors and they are the typical 3-4 errors about not finding the service account folder.  However, even though you changed the settings to specifically look at the proxy DRFSTEALTHSCN02, something is still using the old proxy of DRFSTEALTHSCN.  I checked the server and found this:
[cid:image002.png@01DB9729.EB13AC70]

Even though it’s forced to use DRFSTEALTHSCN02, something is still using the old proxy. Let me know if you want to investigate any further.  I feel whatever is still using the old proxy is the main issue.

Hi Dusty,

                So far, looks like the permission scans for ERNIE2 are successful after you changed the settings. 



 

I checked the errors and they are the typical 3-4 errors about not finding the service account folder.  However, even though you changed the settings to specifically look at the proxy DRFSTEALTHSCN02, something is still using the old proxy of DRFSTEALTHSCN.  I checked the server and found this:



 

Even though it’s forced to use DRFSTEALTHSCN02, something is still using the old proxy. Let me know if you want to investigate any further.  I feel whatever is still using the old proxy is the main issue.

Sorry for the delay. I found the prime issue of the permission scan.  All settings were changed to match the others.

A while back, when we had this issue before, I created scripts to mimic the transferring of data.  I guess I forgot to disable one.  When I changed the proxy, the script was still running and copying empty folders to the console server before the scan started.  Disabling the script fixed the issue.  I reverted all the changes we made to the job back to the original settings.  The scan is running successfully today.  I guess this one falls under “oops, my bad”.  You may close the ticket.
