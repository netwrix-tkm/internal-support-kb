Thank you for the logs. It does look like everything I need for the escalation, so I'm working on that now. In the meantime, you should be good to run a repair on that host. I suspect it will resolve the issue. Even if it does work after the repair, we still want to escalate so Dev can look for a root cause.

To run the repair, please follow the instructions below.
 
Repair the SQL Database


	
	Navigate to and select the 2-FSAA Bulk Import BE job in the NEA Job tree.

	
		
		The exact location in the Job tree can vary based on your deployment.
		
		
		The default location is NEA > Jobs > FileSystem > 0.Collection > 2-FSAA Bulk Import.
		
	
	
	
	Click Configure > Query > Query properties > Configure.

	
		
		This opens the File System Access Audit Data Collector Wizard.
		
	
	
	
	At the bottom of the wizard, click Maintenance.
	
	
	Select the Maintenance type: Repair, then click Next.
	
	
	Select the hosts that are throwing the error (I believe just DRF-ERNIE2 in this instance).
	
	
	Click Run.

	
		
		The maintenance should run immediately.
		
	
	
	
	After the maintenance finishes, click through the following dialogs: Continue > Finish > Next.
	
	Ensure that Import incomplete scan data is enabled, then click Finish.



You should then be able to run the collection and import again.

Please let me know if the error persists, and we will reach out when we have next steps regarding the escalation.
Thank you,

Hello Steven,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help. Thank you for providing the logs. Looking through them, it appears to be an issue updating the SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails table. I've discussed this internally and would like to escalate this ticket. Unfortunately, I will need a more complete collection of logs first.

Please zip up the .log files in that directory. 

There should be another subfolder with the name of the problematic host. Depending on the size of that folder, please zip it up and attach it to the ticket as well.

I suspect it will resolve the issue. Even if it does work after the repair, we still want to escalate so Dev can look for a root cause.

To run the repair, please follow the instructions below.
 
Repair the SQL Database


	
	Navigate to and select the 2-FSAA Bulk Import BE job in the NEA Job tree.

	
		
		The exact location in the Job tree can vary based on your deployment.
		
		
		The default location is NEA > Jobs > FileSystem > 0.Collection > 2-FSAA Bulk Import.
		
	
	
	
	Click Configure > Query > Query properties > Configure.

	
		
		This opens the File System Access Audit Data Collector Wizard.
		
	
	
	
	At the bottom of the wizard, click Maintenance.
	
	
	Select the Maintenance type: Repair, then click Next.
	
	
	Select the hosts that are throwing the error (I believe just DRF-ERNIE2 in this instance).
	
	
	Click Run.

	
		
		The maintenance should run immediately.
		
	
	
	
	After the maintenance finishes, click through the following dialogs: Continue > Finish > Next.
	
	Ensure that Import incomplete scan data is enabled, then click Finish.



You should then be able to run the collection and import again.

Please let me know if the error persists, and we will reach out when we have next steps regarding the escalation.
Thank you,

Thanks Josh.  I have both jobs set to DEBUG now. The scan will run tomorrow afternoon and the Bulk Import runs in the evening, so the earliest I can collect everything would be on Thursday. I will collect and upload to the ticket and let you know when they are available.

Hello Steven,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help. Thank you for providing the logs. Looking through them, it appears to be an issue updating the SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails table. I've discussed this internally and would like to escalate this ticket. Unfortunately, I will need a more complete collection of logs first.

It looks like they already are, but please confirm the logs for both the FSAA scan and bulk import are set to DEBUG:
(Right-click on the job and select Properties > Set ""Log Level"" to DEBUG)



Make sure both the scan and the bulk import jobs have had a chance to run while logs are set to DEBUG.
Then export both jobs and select ""Include all job components""

Attach the resulting .zip files to this ticket.

I'd also like a copy of the proxy logs and, if feasible, the T2 database for that file server.
On the proxy server used for auditing the file server having the issue, navigate to
C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA
Please zip up the .log files in that directory. 

There should be another subfolder with the name of the problematic host. Depending on the size of that folder, please zip it up and attach it to the ticket as well.

If you'd like me help gather these files over a remote session, just let me know.
Please also let me know when the files have been attached to the ticket; otherwise, it's easy for me to miss the notification.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton
Technical Support Engineer Tier 1

Hello Steven,

I have a couple of quick clarifying questions. Can you confirm for me which version and build you are currently running?
NAA > Help > About

Also, what type of file system is DRF-ERNIE2 (e.g., Windows, NetApp, Dell EMC)?

Thank you,

It looks like they already are, but please confirm the logs for both the FSAA scan and bulk import are set to DEBUG:
(Right-click on the job and select Properties > Set ""Log Level"" to DEBUG)

[cid:image002.png@01DBB5D2.5E86E520]

Make sure both the scan and the bulk import jobs have had a chance to run while logs are set to DEBUG.
Then export both jobs and select ""Include all job components""

Attach the resulting .zip files to this ticket.

I'd also like a copy of the proxy logs and, if feasible, the T2 database for that file server.
On the proxy server used for auditing the file server having the issue, navigate to
C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA
Please zip up the .log files in that directory.

There should be another subfolder with the name of the problematic host. Depending on the size of that folder, please zip it up and attach it to the ticket as well.

If you'd like me help gather these files over a remote session, just let me know.
Please also let me know when the files have been attached to the ticket; otherwise, it's easy for me to miss the notification.

Thank you,

I ran the maintenance and got the following error:

I’ve ran it multiple times and keep getting the same message.
So far, it seems we’ve been having issues ever since updating to 12.0. There was an initial issue with the Data Migration when I ran the Create Schema job. Seems it split a table into two tables and we’ve been having different issues since.

Hello Steven,

Thank you for the logs. It does look like everything I need for the escalation, so I'm working on that now. In the meantime, you should be good to run a repair on that host. I suspect it will resolve the issue. Even if it does work after the repair, we still want to escalate so Dev can look for a root cause.

To run the repair, please follow the instructions below.

Repair the SQL Database

  1.  Navigate to and select the 2-FSAA Bulk Import BE job in the NEA Job tree.
     *   The exact location in the Job tree can vary based on your deployment.
     *   The default location is NEA > Jobs > FileSystem > 0.Collection > 2-FSAA Bulk Import.
  2.  Click Configure > Query > Query properties > Configure.
     *   This opens the File System Access Audit Data Collector Wizard.
  3.  At the bottom of the wizard, click Maintenance.
  4.  Select the Maintenance type: Repair, then click Next.
  5.  Select the hosts that are throwing the error (I believe just DRF-ERNIE2 in this instance).
  6.  Click Run.
     *   The maintenance should run immediately.
  7.  After the maintenance finishes, click through the following dialogs: Continue > Finish > Next.
  8.  Ensure that Import incomplete scan data is enabled, then click Finish.

You should then be able to run the collection and import again.

Please let me know if the error persists, and we will reach out when we have next steps regarding the escalation.
Thank you,

Thanks Josh.  I have both jobs set to DEBUG now. The scan will run tomorrow afternoon and the Bulk Import runs in the evening, so the earliest I can collect everything would be on Thursday. I will collect and upload to the ticket and let you know when they are available.

Hey Steven,

I agree with the sentiment about the new tables not cooperating. Definitely appreciate your attempts.

Just for my notes for development can you confirm the Version of SQL server you are running?

Thanks,

I ran the maintenance and got the following error:

Repair tool could not complete:
Problem querying SQL database: The DELETE statement conflicted with he REFERENCE constraint ""FK_SA_FSAA_ResourceMap_ID"". The conflict occurred in database ""StealthAUDIT"", table ""dbo.SA_FSAA_ResourceMap"".
The statement has been terminated.

BeginExecuteNonQuery requires an open and available Connection. The connection's current state is closed.

View or function 'R' is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base tables.

I've ran it multiple times and keep getting the same message.
So far, it seems we've been having issues ever since updating to 12.0. There was an initial issue with the Data Migration when I ran the Create Schema job. Seems it split a table into two tables and we've been having different issues since.

Hello Steven,

Thank you for the logs. It does look like everything I need for the escalation, so I'm working on that now. In the meantime, you should be good to run a repair on that host. I suspect it will resolve the issue. Even if it does work after the repair, we still want to escalate so Dev can look for a root cause.

To run the repair, please follow the instructions below.

Repair the SQL Database

  1.  Navigate to and select the 2-FSAA Bulk Import BE job in the NEA Job tree.

     *   The exact location in the Job tree can vary based on your deployment.
     *   The default location is NEA > Jobs > FileSystem > 0.Collection > 2-FSAA Bulk Import.

  1.  Click Configure > Query > Query properties > Configure.

     *   This opens the File System Access Audit Data Collector Wizard.

  1.  At the bottom of the wizard, click Maintenance.
  2.  Select the Maintenance type: Repair, then click Next.
  3.  Select the hosts that are throwing the error (I believe just DRF-ERNIE2 in this instance).
  4.  Click Run.

     *   The maintenance should run immediately.

  1.  After the maintenance finishes, click through the following dialogs: Continue > Finish > Next.
  2.  Ensure that Import incomplete scan data is enabled, then click Finish.

You should then be able to run the collection and import again.

Please let me know if the error persists, and we will reach out when we have next steps regarding the escalation.
Thank you,

Thanks Josh.  I have both jobs set to DEBUG now. The scan will run tomorrow afternoon and the Bulk Import runs in the evening, so the earliest I can collect everything would be on Thursday. I will collect and upload to the ticket and let you know when they are available.

Hello Steven,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help. Thank you for providing the logs. Looking through them, it appears to be an issue updating the SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails table. I've discussed this internally and would like to escalate this ticket. Unfortunately, I will need a more complete collection of logs first.

It looks like they already are, but please confirm the logs for both the FSAA scan and bulk import are set to DEBUG:
(Right-click on the job and select Properties > Set ""Log Level"" to DEBUG)

[cid:image003.png@01DBB833.27239D90]

Make sure both the scan and the bulk import jobs have had a chance to run while logs are set to DEBUG.
Then export both jobs and select ""Include all job components""

Attach the resulting .zip files to this ticket.

I'd also like a copy of the proxy logs and, if feasible, the T2 database for that file server.
On the proxy server used for auditing the file server having the issue, navigate to
C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA
Please zip up the .log files in that directory.

There should be another subfolder with the name of the problematic host. Depending on the size of that folder, please zip it up and attach it to the ticket as well.

If you'd like me help gather these files over a remote session, just let me know.
Please also let me know when the files have been attached to the ticket; otherwise, it's easy for me to miss the notification.

Thank you,

Hey Steven,

I agree with the sentiment about the new tables not cooperating. Definitely appreciate your attempts.

Just for my notes for development can you confirm the Version of SQL server you are running?

Thanks,

I ran the maintenance and got the following error:

 

Repair tool could not complete:

Problem querying SQL database: The DELETE statement conflicted with he REFERENCE constraint “FK_SA_FSAA_ResourceMap_ID”. The conflict occurred in database “StealthAUDIT”, table “dbo.SA_FSAA_ResourceMap”.

The statement has been terminated.

 

BeginExecuteNonQuery requires an open and available Connection. The connection’s current state is closed.

 

View or function ‘R’ is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base tables.

 

I’ve ran it multiple times and keep getting the same message.

So far, it seems we’ve been having issues ever since updating to 12.0. There was an initial issue with the Data Migration when I ran the Create Schema job. Seems it split a table into two tables and we’ve been having different issues since.

Hello Steven,

I have a couple of quick clarifying questions. Can you confirm for me which version and build you are currently running?
NAA > Help > About

Also, what type of file system is DRF-ERNIE2 (e.g., Windows, NetApp, Dell EMC)?

Thank you,

Hello Steven,

Thank you for the logs. It does look like everything I need for the escalation, so I'm working on that now. In the meantime, you should be good to run a repair on that host. I suspect it will resolve the issue. Even if it does work after the repair, we still want to escalate so Dev can look for a root cause.

To run the repair, please follow the instructions below.
 

Repair the SQL Database


	Navigate to and select the 2-FSAA Bulk Import BE job in the NEA Job tree.



	
	
		The exact location in the Job tree can vary based on your deployment.
		The default location is NEA > Jobs > FileSystem > 0.Collection > 2-FSAA Bulk Import.
	
	



	Click Configure > Query > Query properties > Configure.



	
	
		This opens the File System Access Audit Data Collector Wizard.
	
	



	At the bottom of the wizard, click Maintenance.
	Select the Maintenance type: Repair, then click Next.
	Select the hosts that are throwing the error (I believe just DRF-ERNIE2 in this instance).
	Click Run.



	
	
		The maintenance should run immediately.
	
	



	After the maintenance finishes, click through the following dialogs: Continue > Finish > Next.
	Ensure that Import incomplete scan data is enabled, then click Finish.



You should then be able to run the collection and import again.

Please let me know if the error persists, and we will reach out when we have next steps regarding the escalation.

Thank you,

Thanks Josh.  I have both jobs set to DEBUG now. The scan will run tomorrow afternoon and the Bulk Import runs in the evening, so the earliest I can collect everything would be on Thursday. I will collect and upload to the ticket and let you know when they are available.

Hello Steven,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help. Thank you for providing the logs. Looking through them, it appears to be an issue updating the SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails table. I've discussed this internally and would like to escalate this ticket. Unfortunately, I will need a more complete collection of logs first.

It looks like they already are, but please confirm the logs for both the FSAA scan and bulk import are set to DEBUG:
(Right-click on the job and select Properties > Set ""Log Level"" to DEBUG)



Make sure both the scan and the bulk import jobs have had a chance to run while logs are set to DEBUG.
Then export both jobs and select ""Include all job components""

Attach the resulting .zip files to this ticket.

I'd also like a copy of the proxy logs and, if feasible, the T2 database for that file server.
On the proxy server used for auditing the file server having the issue, navigate to
C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA
Please zip up the .log files in that directory. 

There should be another subfolder with the name of the problematic host. Depending on the size of that folder, please zip it up and attach it to the ticket as well.

If you'd like me help gather these files over a remote session, just let me know.
Please also let me know when the files have been attached to the ticket; otherwise, it's easy for me to miss the notification.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton

Thanks Josh.  I have both jobs set to DEBUG now. The scan will run tomorrow afternoon and the Bulk Import runs in the evening, so the earliest I can collect everything would be on Thursday. I will collect and upload to the ticket and let you know when they are available.

Hello Steven,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help. Thank you for providing the logs. Looking through them, it appears to be an issue updating the SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails table. I've discussed this internally and would like to escalate this ticket. Unfortunately, I will need a more complete collection of logs first.

It looks like they already are, but please confirm the logs for both the FSAA scan and bulk import are set to DEBUG:
(Right-click on the job and select Properties > Set ""Log Level"" to DEBUG)

[cid:image003.png@01DBB83F.AB0232A0]

Make sure both the scan and the bulk import jobs have had a chance to run while logs are set to DEBUG.
Then export both jobs and select ""Include all job components""

Attach the resulting .zip files to this ticket.

I'd also like a copy of the proxy logs and, if feasible, the T2 database for that file server.
On the proxy server used for auditing the file server having the issue, navigate to
C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA
Please zip up the .log files in that directory.

There should be another subfolder with the name of the problematic host. Depending on the size of that folder, please zip it up and attach it to the ticket as well.

If you'd like me help gather these files over a remote session, just let me know.
Please also let me know when the files have been attached to the ticket; otherwise, it's easy for me to miss the notification.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton

Hey Steven,

I agree with the sentiment about the new tables not cooperating. Definitely appreciate your attempts.

Just for my notes for development can you confirm the Version of SQL server you are running?

Thanks,

I ran the maintenance and got the following error:

 

Repair tool could not complete:

Problem querying SQL database: The DELETE statement conflicted with he REFERENCE constraint “FK_SA_FSAA_ResourceMap_ID”. The conflict occurred in database “StealthAUDIT”, table “dbo.SA_FSAA_ResourceMap”.

The statement has been terminated.

 

BeginExecuteNonQuery requires an open and available Connection. The connection’s current state is closed.

 

View or function ‘R’ is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base tables.

 

I’ve ran it multiple times and keep getting the same message.

So far, it seems we’ve been having issues ever since updating to 12.0. There was an initial issue with the Data Migration when I ran the Create Schema job. Seems it split a table into two tables and we’ve been having different issues since.

Hello Steven,

I have a couple of quick clarifying questions. Can you confirm for me which version and build you are currently running?
NAA > Help > About

Also, what type of file system is DRF-ERNIE2 (e.g., Windows, NetApp, Dell EMC)?

Thank you,

Hello Steven,

Thank you for the logs. It does look like everything I need for the escalation, so I'm working on that now. In the meantime, you should be good to run a repair on that host. I suspect it will resolve the issue. Even if it does work after the repair, we still want to escalate so Dev can look for a root cause.

To run the repair, please follow the instructions below.
 

Repair the SQL Database


	Navigate to and select the 2-FSAA Bulk Import BE job in the NEA Job tree.



	 



	
	
		The exact location in the Job tree can vary based on your deployment.
		The default location is NEA > Jobs > FileSystem > 0.Collection > 2-FSAA Bulk Import.
	
	



	Click Configure > Query > Query properties > Configure.



	 



	
	
		This opens the File System Access Audit Data Collector Wizard.
	
	



	At the bottom of the wizard, click Maintenance.
	Select the Maintenance type: Repair, then click Next.
	Select the hosts that are throwing the error (I believe just DRF-ERNIE2 in this instance).
	Click Run.



	 



	
	
		The maintenance should run immediately.
	
	



	After the maintenance finishes, click through the following dialogs: Continue > Finish > Next.
	Ensure that Import incomplete scan data is enabled, then click Finish.



You should then be able to run the collection and import again.

Please let me know if the error persists, and we will reach out when we have next steps regarding the escalation.

Thank you,
