From R&D.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)
The last fully tested version is ONTAP 9.7. While we are not aware of any changes in subsequent versions that would cause issues, we cannot document official support until testing is completed.

Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM) formally Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM)
While SAM 6.0 supports ONTAP 9.15.x, we recommend upgrading to NAM 8.0 for its support of the new ONTAP 9.15 feature, Persistent Store.
This feature decouples client IO from FPolicy event reporting, reducing latency issues caused by network hiccups or high activity.
