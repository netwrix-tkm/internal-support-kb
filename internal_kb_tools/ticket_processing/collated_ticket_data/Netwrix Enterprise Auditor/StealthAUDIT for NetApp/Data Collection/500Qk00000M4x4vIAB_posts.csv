This should prove that the FSAADBs were updated on both host, as well see good time stamps on the files
We found that the Ernie2 folder was re-created at 1:45am Today (03062025) however we were not able to isolate which job created the empty folder.
Let me know if the Security Event log list out any of the folder modification.

Re-confirmed that the Proxy was induvial listed in each of the Groups scans

Confirmed within the SA_FSAA_Hosts table still list the LastScanHost as our expected Proxy.
Temp set the Run as in the schedule task as the domainService account (not other job have this).
If needed we can try for another meeting tomorrow after noon to drop all Ernie2 Tier 2 data and then rescan.

Prior: When a manual scan is kicked off via the scheduled task the job runs as expected.

When the next scheduled run auto starts we get the T2 is newer than on the NEA host even after removing the DBs on the Proxy.

Post SEEK T2 DB clean up and Proxy change for ERNIE2 the original work FSAA jobs is now posting  “Detected Tier 2 databases on remote applet server are newer than local databases. Retrieving databases and skipping scan”","","","","00570000003KXurAAG","2025-03-11T13:30:41.000Z"
