Hi Joshua,

Sorry for the slow movement on this. I have now spoken with the team that originally requested for info about the errors, and they are not as concerned. But there is an issue with our UK scans which may be giving them some outdated info. Can we setup some time to figure out why our UK activity scan is no working?

Thank you,

This ticket is for investigating issues with FSAA scans. We can prioritize investigating your UK FSAC scans, but that should be on its own ticket. I will create one and send you a scheduling link.

Sorry, I was on PTO the last 2 weeks. You can go ahead and close this ticket for PHX and IND, don’t think this will be an issue. But if it comes up again I can go ahead and open another ticket.
