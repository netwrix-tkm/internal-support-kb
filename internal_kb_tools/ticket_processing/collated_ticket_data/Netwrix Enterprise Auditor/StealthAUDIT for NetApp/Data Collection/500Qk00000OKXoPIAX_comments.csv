@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer

Can I get the Create Schema job OUTPUT folder?

There is a new log in 12.0 that may be helpful: the Coordination Service log.
This can be found in %SAINSTALLDIR%SADatabaseLogsCoordinationService on the NAA console.
Please get all of them.

This situation can come about if there are 2+ rows in the SA_FSAA_ResourceMap table
that have different IDs, but the same AccessID.
To test if this scenario applies to them, run the following SQL and report back the results:
SELECT rm.HOST, rm.AccessID, COUNT(rm.AccessID) as [count]
FROM SA_FSAA_ResourceMap rm
INNER JOIN SA_FSAA_Hosts h ON h.ID = rm.HOST
WHERE h.HOST = 'DRF-ERNIE2'
GROUP BY rm.HOST, rm.AccessID
HAVING COUNT(rm.AccessID) > 1;

There could be multiple resources in this situation.
Then get us a resource's data by choosing 1 AccessID, and plugging it into the following SQL
so we can figure out why this happened:
SELECT r.*
FROM SA_FSAA_Resources r
INNER JOIN SA_FSAA_Hosts h ON r.HOST = h.ID
WHERE r.ID = (SELECT MIN(ID) FROM SA_FSAA_ResourceMap WHERE AccessID = <an AccessID from above>)
AND h.HOST = 'DRF-ERNIE2';

However we are having all sorts of issues with the scans. Every scan something different is happening. Not sure how to address this.
I suspect due to their Database not working super well last time  we poked around could be some troubles on that end.|
