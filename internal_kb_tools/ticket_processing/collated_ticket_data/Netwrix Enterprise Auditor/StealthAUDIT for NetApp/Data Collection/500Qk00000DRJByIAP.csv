"500Qk00000DRJByIAP","00415776","Support Ticket","Long running scan and scan errors","We recently added new NetApp SVM scan targets.  One of the targets has been scanning for 6 days.  several of the other SVM targets have errors on the scan.","","","","Contact noted:  We have validated our fpolicy against a single SVM and working to apply that fpolicy to all SVMs. 


The most recent StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5 scan we are down to 46 issues all seeming to point to Share locations that no longer exist. 

Selected the Import incomplete scan data for the NetApp FSAA Job group.

We looked at setting the Schedule back to the top of the FileSystem Group folder to mitigate overlapping FSAA bulk-imports and Reporting from locking the DB.

Stopped the current FSAA Scan, Selected the Import incomplete scan data option.

Kicked off the Related NetApp Bulk-import once completed we will need to run the Reports schedule task or let it kick off tomorrow as set in the console.

Set the schedule to only run the Root Job Group Folder for FileSystem.

We will need to look at the Scan again once the needed FPolicy has been updated.
