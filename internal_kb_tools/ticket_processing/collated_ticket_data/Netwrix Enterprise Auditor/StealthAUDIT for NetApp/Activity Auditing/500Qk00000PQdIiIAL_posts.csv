- The issue appears to be related to insufficient permissions to access the specified registry key, which prevents the scan from retrieving the necessary configuration file path.
- The problem occurs in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6 (build 11.6.0.132) and is reproducible by initiating an FSAC System scan.
- It is unclear whether the issue is caused by a misconfiguration, a permissions issue, or a software defect. Further investigation is required to determine the root cause.
