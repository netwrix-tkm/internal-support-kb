- The issue appears to be related to insufficient permissions to access the specified registry key, which prevents the scan from retrieving the necessary configuration file path.
- The problem occurs in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6 (build 11.6.0.132) and is reproducible by initiating an FSAC System scan.
- It is unclear whether the issue is caused by a misconfiguration, a permissions issue, or a software defect. Further investigation is required to determine the root cause.","No next steps documented.

Cause: The issue appears to be related to insufficient permissions to access the specified registry key, which prevents the scan from retrieving the necessary configuration file path. The exact root cause (whether it is a misconfiguration, permissions issue, or software defect) remains undetermined.

Resolution: 
• Open C:ProgramDataNetwrixActivity MonitorAgentSBTFileMon.ini on ISR-MMR-FS1
• Under the [FILE_MONITOR1] section, look for STEALTHAUDIT=ON 
• Set this to STEALTHAUDIT=OFF and save
• Kick off a new FSAC System Scan","Root Cause Unknown","Frantz Baptiste","Request","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for NetApp","Activity Auditing","11.6","11.6.0.132","7.2","Closed - Resolved","EverBank","Bradley Dickinson","2025-05-21T16:38:47.000Z","2025-05-28T21:48:33.000Z"
