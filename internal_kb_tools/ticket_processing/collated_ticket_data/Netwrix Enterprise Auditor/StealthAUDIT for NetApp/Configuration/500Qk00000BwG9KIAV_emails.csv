Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")


Once your quires are complete the import will need to be run till completion or the next scan will error that a import is needed.

Was the import running at the same time as an Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job?

Thank You for your time.

The files have already been uploaded.
I'm not sure what upgrade would have occurred on 6/12, we last upgraded 2/22/24.
Skimming the release notes, none of the fixes seem related to the issue we're having.

Subject: Netwrix Support Ticket #412112 - 2-FSAA Bulk Import taking 10+ hours

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BwG9K:ref

The job continued to take over 10 hours to complete today, but I was able to allow it to finish. I grabbed the logs if those can be examined for why the resolve links portion has suddenly increased so much.

Connie,

Thank you for reaching out to support.

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path

(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")


Once your quires are complete the import will need to be run till completion or the next scan will error that a import is needed.

Was the import running at the same time as an Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job?

Thank You for your time.

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                          11.5.0.260          Repair install date 2024/6/12

The only change noted since the Repair on 6/12 was KB5037763 installed on the SQL host similar issue occurred on 5/22 possible related to the update installed on 5/18

We ran my StealthBits_SQL_Host_Details_collection script to look over an possible issues.
One point of contention could be that the SQL host only has 4vCore for multiple SQL DBs within this instance.
 
The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.

I will review these along with the Bulk import details provided.

Connie,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |

(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")


Once your quires are complete the import will need to be run till completion or the next scan will error that a import is needed.

Was the import running at the same time as an Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job?

Thank You for your time.

Connie,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                          11.5.0.260          Repair install date 2024/6/12

The only change noted since the Repair on 6/12 was KB5037763 installed on the SQL host similar issue occurred on 5/22 possible related to the update installed on 5/18

We ran my StealthBits_SQL_Host_Details_collection script to look over an possible issues.
One point of contention could be that the SQL host only has 4vCore for multiple SQL DBs within this instance.
 
The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.
https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=my_tickets.html

Once the upload has completed reply to this email, so I know to pull the files.

I will review these along with the Bulk import details provided.

Again, thank You for your time.

I believe the “install” date you are seeing are related to the repair we did in 00411545.

The bulk import has remained a reasonable run time, but we're still interested to know why the spikes to 10+ hours.
Whether this is a bug in StealthAudit or even in something in our environment that maybe needs to be exclude to prevent a re-occurrence of the issue.

The screenshots were simply to show StealthAudit was performing something different resulting in the 10+ hours.
Nothing has changed on the SQL server and the requested details are an overreach.

The only change noted since the Repair on 6/12 was KB5037763 installed on the SQL host similar issue occurred on 5/22 possible related to the update installed on 5/18

We ran my StealthBits_SQL_Host_Details_collection script to look over an possible issues.
One point of contention could be that the SQL host only has 4vCore for multiple SQL DBs within this instance.

The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.

Connie,

Thank you for reaching out to support.

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |

Once your quires are complete the import will need to be run till completion or the next scan will error that a import is needed.

Was the import running at the same time as an Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job?

Thank You for your time.

Being that nothing has changes on the SQL host and the StealthAUDIT (SA) are also still running the same queries when it runs for 10hrs as well as the 30min runs, we will need the requested details during the next long running job to try and identify the issue.

Please let me know how the jobs complete.

The bulk import has remained a reasonable run time, but we’re still interested to know why the spikes to 10+ hours.

Whether this is a bug in StealthAudit or even in something in our environment that maybe needs to be exclude to prevent a re-occurrence of the issue.

 

The screenshots were simply to show StealthAudit was performing something different resulting in the 10+ hours.

Nothing has changed on the SQL server and the requested details are an overreach.

Connie,

Thank You for the update.

Let's keep an eye on it if the next run has the long/heavy query please have the dba provide a full export of the details from the screenshots as well as a full detailed SQL Server Profiler trace (.trc) file.

Please also have them include all Active Queries on the server.

Have a great weekend.

Again, thank You for your time.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BwG9K:ref

The bulk import took about 30 minutes today with no changes, but we still need to pinpoint the cause as it is not the first time this has happened and obviously causes issues for others when it runs in excess for 10 hours.

My DBA provided these, during the high job times, there are significantly more reads than the low job times so something is different from the StealthAudit side that has nothing to do with the resources of our SQL server.

Connie,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")


Once your quires are complete the import will need to be run till completion or the next scan will error that a import is needed.

Was the import running at the same time as an Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job?

Thank You for your time.

StealthAudit is performing 10 billion+ reads versus the usual 6 million reads, that is the difference.

Connie,

Being that nothing has changes on the SQL host and the StealthAUDIT (SA) are also still running the same queries when it runs for 10hrs as well as the 30min runs, we will need the requested details during the next long running job to try and identify the issue.

Please let me know how the jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

The bulk import has remained a reasonable run time, but we're still interested to know why the spikes to 10+ hours.
Whether this is a bug in StealthAudit or even in something in our environment that maybe needs to be exclude to prevent a re-occurrence of the issue.

The screenshots were simply to show StealthAudit was performing something different resulting in the 10+ hours.
Nothing has changed on the SQL server and the requested details are an overreach.

Connie,

Thank You for the update.

Let's keep an eye on it if the next run has the long/heavy query please have the dba provide a full export of the details from the screenshots as well as a full detailed SQL Server Profiler trace (.trc) file.

Please also have them include all Active Queries on the server.

Have a great weekend.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BwG9K:ref

The bulk import took about 30 minutes today with no changes, but we still need to pinpoint the cause as it is not the first time this has happened and obviously causes issues for others when it runs in excess for 10 hours.

My DBA provided these, during the high job times, there are significantly more reads than the low job times so something is different from the StealthAudit side that has nothing to do with the resources of our SQL server.

Connie,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                          11.5.0.260          Repair install date 2024/6/12

The only change noted since the Repair on 6/12 was KB5037763 installed on the SQL host similar issue occurred on 5/22 possible related to the update installed on 5/18

We ran my StealthBits_SQL_Host_Details_collection script to look over an possible issues.
One point of contention could be that the SQL host only has 4vCore for multiple SQL DBs within this instance.

The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.

Once the upload has completed reply to this email, so I know to pull the files.

I will review these along with the Bulk import details provided.

StealthAudit is performing 10 billion+ reads versus the usual 6 million reads, that is the difference.

Please figure out your product is misbehaving.

Connie,

Being that nothing has changes on the SQL host and the StealthAUDIT (SA) are also still running the same queries when it runs for 10hrs as well as the 30min runs, we will need the requested details during the next long running job to try and identify the issue.

Please let me know how the jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

The bulk import has remained a reasonable run time, but we’re still interested to know why the spikes to 10+ hours.

Whether this is a bug in StealthAudit or even in something in our environment that maybe needs to be exclude to prevent a re-occurrence of the issue.

 

The screenshots were simply to show StealthAudit was performing something different resulting in the 10+ hours.

Nothing has changed on the SQL server and the requested details are an overreach.

Connie,

Thank You for the update.

Let's keep an eye on it if the next run has the long/heavy query please have the dba provide a full export of the details from the screenshots as well as a full detailed SQL Server Profiler trace (.trc) file.

Please also have them include all Active Queries on the server.

Have a great weekend.

Again, thank You for your time.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BwG9K:ref

The bulk import took about 30 minutes today with no changes, but we still need to pinpoint the cause as it is not the first time this has happened and obviously causes issues for others when it runs in excess for 10 hours.

My DBA provided these, during the high job times, there are significantly more reads than the low job times so something is different from the StealthAudit side that has nothing to do with the resources of our SQL server.

Connie,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                          11.5.0.260          Repair install date 2024/6/12

The only change noted since the Repair on 6/12 was KB5037763 installed on the SQL host similar issue occurred on 5/22 possible related to the update installed on 5/18

We ran my StealthBits_SQL_Host_Details_collection script to look over an possible issues.
One point of contention could be that the SQL host only has 4vCore for multiple SQL DBs within this instance.
 
The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.
https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=my_tickets.html

Once the upload has completed reply to this email, so I know to pull the files.

I will review these along with the Bulk import details provided.

Again, thank You for your time.

Connie,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")


Once your quires are complete the import will need to be run till completion or the next scan will error that a import is needed.

Was the import running at the same time as an Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job?

Thank You for your time.

StealthAudit is performing 10 billion+ reads versus the usual 6 million reads, that is the difference.

Please figure out your product is misbehaving.

Connie,

Being that nothing has changes on the SQL host and the StealthAUDIT (SA) are also still running the same queries when it runs for 10hrs as well as the 30min runs, we will need the requested details during the next long running job to try and identify the issue.

Please let me know how the jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

The bulk import has remained a reasonable run time, but we’re still interested to know why the spikes to 10+ hours.

Whether this is a bug in StealthAudit or even in something in our environment that maybe needs to be exclude to prevent a re-occurrence of the issue.

 

The screenshots were simply to show StealthAudit was performing something different resulting in the 10+ hours.

Nothing has changed on the SQL server and the requested details are an overreach.

Connie,

Thank You for the update.

Let's keep an eye on it if the next run has the long/heavy query please have the dba provide a full export of the details from the screenshots as well as a full detailed SQL Server Profiler trace (.trc) file.

Please also have them include all Active Queries on the server.

Have a great weekend.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BwG9K:ref

The bulk import took about 30 minutes today with no changes, but we still need to pinpoint the cause as it is not the first time this has happened and obviously causes issues for others when it runs in excess for 10 hours.

My DBA provided these, during the high job times, there are significantly more reads than the low job times so something is different from the StealthAudit side that has nothing to do with the resources of our SQL server.

Connie,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                          11.5.0.260          Repair install date 2024/6/12

The only change noted since the Repair on 6/12 was KB5037763 installed on the SQL host similar issue occurred on 5/22 possible related to the update installed on 5/18

We ran my StealthBits_SQL_Host_Details_collection script to look over an possible issues.
One point of contention could be that the SQL host only has 4vCore for multiple SQL DBs within this instance.
 
The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.
https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=my_tickets.html

Once the upload has completed reply to this email, so I know to pull the files.

I will review these along with the Bulk import details provided.

Connie,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")


Once your quires are complete the import will need to be run till completion or the next scan will error that a import is needed.

Was the import running at the same time as an Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job?

Thank You for your time.

The job continued to take over 10 hours to complete today, but I was able to allow it to finish. I grabbed the logs if those can be examined for why the resolve links portion has suddenly increased so much.

Connie,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")


Once your quires are complete the import will need to be run till completion or the next scan will error that a import is needed.

Was the import running at the same time as an Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job?

Thank You for your time.

StealthAudit is performing 10 billion+ reads versus the usual 6 million reads, that is the difference.

Connie,

Being that nothing has changes on the SQL host and the StealthAUDIT (SA) are also still running the same queries when it runs for 10hrs as well as the 30min runs, we will need the requested details during the next long running job to try and identify the issue.

Please let me know how the jobs complete.

The bulk import has remained a reasonable run time, but we're still interested to know why the spikes to 10+ hours.
Whether this is a bug in StealthAudit or even in something in our environment that maybe needs to be exclude to prevent a re-occurrence of the issue.

The screenshots were simply to show StealthAudit was performing something different resulting in the 10+ hours.
Nothing has changed on the SQL server and the requested details are an overreach.

Connie,

Thank You for the update.

Let's keep an eye on it if the next run has the long/heavy query please have the dba provide a full export of the details from the screenshots as well as a full detailed SQL Server Profiler trace (.trc) file.

Please also have them include all Active Queries on the server.

Have a great weekend.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BwG9K:ref

The bulk import took about 30 minutes today with no changes, but we still need to pinpoint the cause as it is not the first time this has happened and obviously causes issues for others when it runs in excess for 10 hours.

My DBA provided these, during the high job times, there are significantly more reads than the low job times so something is different from the StealthAudit side that has nothing to do with the resources of our SQL server.

The job continued to take over 10 hours to complete today, but I was able to allow it to finish. I grabbed the logs if those can be examined for why the resolve links portion has suddenly increased so much.

Connie,

Thank you for reaching out to support.

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path

(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")


Once your quires are complete the import will need to be run till completion or the next scan will error that a import is needed.

Was the import running at the same time as an Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job?

Thank You for your time.

StealthAudit is performing 10 billion+ reads versus the usual 6 million reads, that is the difference.

Please figure out your product is misbehaving.

Connie,

Being that nothing has changes on the SQL host and the StealthAUDIT (SA) are also still running the same queries when it runs for 10hrs as well as the 30min runs, we will need the requested details during the next long running job to try and identify the issue.

Please let me know how the jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

The bulk import has remained a reasonable run time, but we’re still interested to know why the spikes to 10+ hours.

Whether this is a bug in StealthAudit or even in something in our environment that maybe needs to be exclude to prevent a re-occurrence of the issue.

 

The screenshots were simply to show StealthAudit was performing something different resulting in the 10+ hours.

Nothing has changed on the SQL server and the requested details are an overreach.

Connie,

Thank You for the update.

Let's keep an eye on it if the next run has the long/heavy query please have the dba provide a full export of the details from the screenshots as well as a full detailed SQL Server Profiler trace (.trc) file.

Please also have them include all Active Queries on the server.

Have a great weekend.

Again, thank You for your time.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000BwG9K:ref

The bulk import took about 30 minutes today with no changes, but we still need to pinpoint the cause as it is not the first time this has happened and obviously causes issues for others when it runs in excess for 10 hours.

My DBA provided these, during the high job times, there are significantly more reads than the low job times so something is different from the StealthAudit side that has nothing to do with the resources of our SQL server.

Connie,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                          11.5.0.260          Repair install date 2024/6/12

The only change noted since the Repair on 6/12 was KB5037763 installed on the SQL host similar issue occurred on 5/22 possible related to the update installed on 5/18

We ran my StealthBits_SQL_Host_Details_collection script to look over an possible issues.
One point of contention could be that the SQL host only has 4vCore for multiple SQL DBs within this instance.
 
The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.
https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=my_tickets.html

Once the upload has completed reply to this email, so I know to pull the files.

I will review these along with the Bulk import details provided.

Again, thank You for your time.

I believe the “install” date you are seeing are related to the repair we did in 00411545.

The job continued to take over 10 hours to complete today, but I was able to allow it to finish. I grabbed the logs if those can be examined for why the resolve links portion has suddenly increased so much.

Connie,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")


Once your quires are complete the import will need to be run till completion or the next scan will error that a import is needed.

Was the import running at the same time as an Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job?

Thank You for your time.
