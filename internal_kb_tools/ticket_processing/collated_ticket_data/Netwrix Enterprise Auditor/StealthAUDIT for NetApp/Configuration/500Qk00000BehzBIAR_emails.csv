Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
If it's a NetApp hosted in Azure, your expertise in ensuring open ports and valid credentials is crucial for its functionality.
You might have to update the Fpolicy if the SVM's or anything changes.
If you don't have access to the NetApp appliance, how would you give Activity Monitor access to it?
 
Thanks,

Hi Franz, from your questions below it sounds like Netwrix doesn’t have any experience tracking file system activity on a Microsoft managed Netapp appliance running in Azure.
Is that accurate?

Also, are you able to tell me who my account manager is?

Thank You
Mike

This was just a question which was answered.  We will do more investigation to see if fPolicy is available to us.

This ticket can be closed.
