Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support.

Can you please export and upload the scan job and import job so I can take a look at the logs?


Make sure to include all objects, but it may be helpful to change the output location to the desktop:


Once those have been updated, let me know and I can begin investigating.

Thank you for meeting with me yesterday. To recap our session, it looks like the biggest issue we are running into is the FSAA System Scan and the SEEK system scan running at the same time which is causing table lock issues in SQL due to them trying to use the same tables. Additional information can be found here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/FileSystem/Collection/Overview.htm

We stopped both scans, made sure there were no running.lck files in either of the job directories, and then began a level 3 scan starting from the Collection group so it will run through the FSAA scan and FSAA bulk import before moving on to the SEEK tasks.

We also observed a permissions issue on the DFW NAS. I would recommend having your NetAPP team look over the permissions and compare them to the server that is scanning, or to the permissions outlined in the document below:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/Config/NetAppCMode/Access.htm
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/LocalModePorts.htm

Let me know how the scans looks when they finish or if you have any additional questions!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri
