"00aQk000007YBZhIAO","500Qk00000BwG9KIAV","Problem Statement/Business Impact:
SA 11.5.0.260 FSAA Resolve links analysis at times takes 10+ hours to complete. 9k+ Reads on the SQL DB
Normally runs in about 30min 6k+ Reads on the SQL DB
Same issue noted for this customer in Ticket Number 00392841
   https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/500Qk000005Q2UlIAK/view

Desired Outcome:
For the job to complete in its more normal time of around 30min.

Steps to Reproduce:
Unable to reproduce at will.
Contact states that nothing has changed on the SQL instance and the same job had similar issues prior to a repair of the installed version. 

Reliably Repro'd in Customer Envi

Troubleshooting completed/Notes: 
1.Make sure no other jobs are running and kick off the FSAA tree to update the SQL tables.

Ensure relevant logs are uploaded to SPO:
Application Logs
Job Logs
Other SQL Server details, Error and System logs.
Details from SQL show that at times the job is preforming 9k+ reads ( 10hr runtime) and during expected run-times around 
6k+ reads that completes in about 30min.

1. Check host list on job settings, properties and scheduled task. 
Seems like there may be dup hosts....
2. Screen Shot of Scheduled Tasks 
This may be due to either duplicate hosts and/ or to her jobs running or Load on the SQL server from other app if a shared instance.","0054u000006goKoAAI","2024-06-26T19:43:47.000Z","2024-06-26T19:43:47.000Z","false","false"
