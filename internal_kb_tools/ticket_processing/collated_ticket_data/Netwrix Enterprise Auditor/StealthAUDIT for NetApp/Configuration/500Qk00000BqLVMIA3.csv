"500Qk00000BqLVMIA3","00411975","Support Ticket","Share Activity Issues","When II go to use the StealthAudit web console (AIC), I have attempted to look at activity for folders on our file share, however it always seems to return zero results even if I can find a record, I anticipated in the dbo.SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView view in SQL. 

In order to resolve all of these issues I would like to schedule time to share screens.

If there is any additional information I can gather in the meantime, please let me know.

Thanks,

Customer is not seeing all the activity data from the Activity Monitor in the AIC despite successful collections and imports.

[Root Cause]
Customer migrated NetApp data from the old NAS to a new NetApp with the same name as before causing issues with pathing and pre-existing data in the database.

[Resolution]
We reconfigured permissions on the new NetApp using CIFS Method 2 Credential Configuration. Then we renamed the old NetApp data in the NEA database to show the host as ""OLD_HCDATASTORE.HC.HOWARDCOUNTYMD.GOV"". Now when the FSAA scan runs and imports, the new permissions will line up with the correct host. Then we scheduled a job to drop the data of the old server in 60 days.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for NetApp","Configuration","11.5","","56.3","Closed - Resolved","Howard County, MD","Frank Salah","2024-06-14T13:31:50.000Z","2024-08-09T21:24:46.000Z"
