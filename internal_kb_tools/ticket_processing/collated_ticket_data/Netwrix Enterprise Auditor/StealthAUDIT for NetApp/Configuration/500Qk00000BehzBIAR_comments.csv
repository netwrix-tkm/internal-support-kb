I have a customer who asked me 
The customer is looking to move his file shares from an on premise Windows server to a NetApp appliance running in Azure.
He wants to know if Activity Monitor will still be able to be used against the NetApp appliance in Azure?
I explained to the customer as long as they have the correct ports and a valid credential SAM should be able to continue monitor the NetApp.

Does Netwrix have any experience tracking file system activity on a Microsoft managed NetApp appliance running in Azure?
If yes, is there any settings that need to change on the NetApp side or in NAM?

There are different flavors of NetApp in Azure.
	1. NetApp Cloud Volumes ONTAP (Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Azure – Azure CVO | NetApp). We haven't tested it ourselves, but according to our NetApp contact, it works exactly like an on-prem version. So NAM should be able to monitor it.
	 
	2. Azure NetApp Files ( https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/netapp). Last time I checked, it didn't support the FPolicy protocol (the protocol we use for activity collection). But I was told that it was in their roadmap.

Get top performance in Azure with Cloud Volumes ONTAP. A superior system for data management, CVO from NetApp provides simplified data migration and file storage.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-06-17T20:50:13.000Z","2024-06-17T20:50:13.000Z","false","false"
