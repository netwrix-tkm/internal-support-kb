Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support. 

The ""One Domain Controller per Domain"" is a default host list that selects a DC based on a stored SQL procedure. This list can't be changed manually, however you can create a new list in the Host Management node, containing a DC for each domain that you'd like to query, and set the job group to use that host list. More information on Host Management can be found in our documentation here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/04.Host_Management/Host_Management_Activities.htm#_Add_Hosts

The warnings you're seeing on the 1-AD_Scan are related to custom attributes Netwrix is looking for out of the box. If the attributes listed in the warnings are not something you use or collect, you can either ignore the warnings (no affect on the scan) or you can remove the offending attributes following this article: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000000divKAA.html

As for the Activity Events, let's set up a remote session to take a look:

Hi Tay,

Assuming I followed directions correctly, I do not believe I resolved the issue.

The 2-FSAC Bulk Import job completed with the status success.
[cid:image001.png@01DACC78.52798B50]

The 3-FSAC Exceptions job was run afterwards and also completed with the status success.
[cid:image002.png@01DACC78.52798B50]

I looked up the first entry from the Stealthbits Activity Monitor and drilled down to that path in in the web portal but did not see any activity details or statistics. I was able to find the record in the dbo.SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView. One thing I did notice is that is had the UserSID, but the fields containing the username, domain, etc., were all NULL, even though we can see it in the Activity Monitor.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do in the meantime before we meet again tomorrow.

Thank you for meeting with us this morning. To recap our session, we:

	Found that the new NetApp paths are slightly different than previously, leading us to believe there may be some missing permissions on the NetApp that got lost during the transition
	Ran an FSAA scan at level 0 depth and received an access denied error


Please have your NetApp team review the permissions on the NetApp host (link below, we recommend Method 2) and then send us a screenshot of what the shares looks like in Computer Management. We will then be able to compare that with what we have in the AIC to see if they match or not. If they don't match, we may need to drop/archive data and run a fresh scan.

Hi Tay,

Could you send me a link to schedule a call?  I want to walk through this again with Neil , our NetApp admin (CCed here), so we can all take a look together.

Thanks,
Frank

Hey Frank,

Thank you for meeting with us this morning. To recap our session, we:

  *   Found that the new NetApp paths are slightly different than previously, leading us to believe there may be some missing permissions on the NetApp that got lost during the transition
  *   Ran an FSAA scan at level 0 depth and received an access denied error

Please have your NetApp team review the permissions on the NetApp host (link below, we recommend Method 2) and then send us a screenshot of what the shares looks like in Computer Management. We will then be able to compare that with what we have in the AIC to see if they match or not. If they don't match, we may need to drop/archive data and run a fresh scan.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hey Frank,

We may actually be seeing a similar behavior with another client as well so I'm going to bring my T2 Engineer, Nick, with me tomorrow to our session.

Thank you,

Hi Tay,

Assuming I followed directions correctly, I do not believe I resolved the issue.

The 2-FSAC Bulk Import job completed with the status success.
[cid:image001.png@01DAD1EB.804AB3B0]

The 3-FSAC Exceptions job was run afterwards and also completed with the status success.
[cid:image002.png@01DAD1EB.804AB3B0]

I looked up the first entry from the Stealthbits Activity Monitor and drilled down to that path in in the web portal but did not see any activity details or statistics. I was able to find the record in the dbo.SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView. One thing I did notice is that is had the UserSID, but the fields containing the username, domain, etc., were all NULL, even though we can see it in the Activity Monitor.

[cid:image003.png@01DAD1EB.804AB3B0]

[cid:image004.png@01DAD1EB.804AB3B0]
[cid:image005.png@01DAD1EB.804AB3B0]

Please let me know if there is anything I can do in the meantime before we meet again tomorrow.

Thanks,
Frank

Hey Frank,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we enabled the ""Report UNC Paths"" option on the NetApp server in Activity Monitor and then began the FSAC collection process. Once the FSAC Bulk Import completes, please run the FSAC_Exceptions job. After that job completes, please take a look in the AIC and verify if we're able to see FileSystem activity data past the host level and let me know if you're still not seeing anything.

Thank you,

Hi Tay,

 

Could you send me a link to schedule a call?  I want to walk through this again with Neil , our NetApp admin (CCed here), so we can all take a look together.

 


Thanks,

Frank

Hey Frank,

Thank you for meeting with us this morning. To recap our session, we:


	Found that the new NetApp paths are slightly different than previously, leading us to believe there may be some missing permissions on the NetApp that got lost during the transition
	Ran an FSAA scan at level 0 depth and received an access denied error



Please have your NetApp team review the permissions on the NetApp host (link below, we recommend Method 2) and then send us a screenshot of what the shares looks like in Computer Management. We will then be able to compare that with what we have in the AIC to see if they match or not. If they don't match, we may need to drop/archive data and run a fresh scan.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hey Frank,

We may actually be seeing a similar behavior with another client as well so I'm going to bring my T2 Engineer, Nick, with me tomorrow to our session.

Thank you,

Hi Tay,

 

Assuming I followed directions correctly, I do not believe I resolved the issue.

 

The 2-FSAC Bulk Import job completed with the status success.



 

The 3-FSAC Exceptions job was run afterwards and also completed with the status success.



 

I looked up the first entry from the Stealthbits Activity Monitor and drilled down to that path in in the web portal but did not see any activity details or statistics. I was able to find the record in the dbo.SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView. One thing I did notice is that is had the UserSID, but the fields containing the username, domain, etc., were all NULL, even though we can see it in the Activity Monitor.

 



 






 

Please let me know if there is anything I can do in the meantime before we meet again tomorrow.

 

Thanks,

Frank

Hey Frank,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we enabled the ""Report UNC Paths"" option on the NetApp server in Activity Monitor and then began the FSAC collection process. Once the FSAC Bulk Import  completes, please run the FSAC_Exceptions job. After that job completes, please take a look in the AIC and verify if we're able to see FileSystem activity data past the host level and let me know if you're still not seeing anything.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Senior Technical Support Engineer
