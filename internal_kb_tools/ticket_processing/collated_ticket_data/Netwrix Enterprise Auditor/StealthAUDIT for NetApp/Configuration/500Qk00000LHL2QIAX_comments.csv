@Michael Burrofato @Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer

This is working in my lab.
Please ensure this workflow is being followed:
FSAA scan -> FSAA import -> FSAA Exceptions -> OpenAccess.
Because it isn't mentioned in the ticket, I think what must be the issue is that the FSAA Exceptions job is not being re-run

Investigating the analyses, in the meantime 
can I get the job xmls and job logs for the FSAA scan and FSAA BI jobs as well as the applet log for the host RCOvSVR4525 that has the open share MS_DATA from the screenshot ""Shared in Resource Audit.jpg""

@Michael Burrofato @Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer @Chris Brooks

What was provided is insufficient.

The FS scan job and FS bi job logs are empty, and I requested applet logs not applet server logs.

Applet server logs are the logs for the process FSAAAppletServer.exe found in the FSAA folder with the format
FSAA_Applet_Server_[EXEC HOST]_[PID]_[DATETIME].log
whereas the Applet is FSAASrv.dll and its logs are found in the FSAA[Host] folder with the format
[FSAA/FSAC/SDD]_[HOST]_[DATETIME]_[GUID]_#.log

Please have customer change their job log levels to DEBUG at
Settings > Application > Log level > Debug (this is global)
or on the specific jobs in question rt click job > properties > Log Level > Debug.

Looks like scans are not being scoped - can we verify this?

I can only verify that the Exceptions job log and the screenshot ""Host list.jpg"" look the same, but
Make sure the host list is the same for scan, import, and exceptions jobs
and include the server with the missing open share (MS_DATA) in question: RCOVSVR4525.
then re-run FS scan > FS BI > Exceptions > OA.

If problem persists, please provide the new debug level job logs and applet logs.

@Michael Longo @Robert Minichino @Michael Burrofato @Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer

The SQLite dbs for the host RCOVSVR4525 show permissions for Everyone on the share MS_DATA.
Please rule out a data collection problem by running the following in powershell, filling in the information.
$acl = Get-Acl -Path ""\RCOVSVR4525MS_DATA""
$acl.Access | % { echo $_ }

You will need elevated permissions for this.
This will show if/what permissions Everyone has.
If IdentityReference: Everyone has AccessControlType:Allow, then there is no issue here and product is working as expected.
Otherwise, please provide output and we will investigate data collection.

The screenshot 00434179_i.png is showing that the correct permissions have been collected and that this is an Open Share.

The screenshot ""Open Shares.jpg"" shows the top 5 and top 9 in the chart and grid respectively.
The screenshot ""00434179_c.png"" shows ~89.4k open resources, and the ""Open Shares.jpg"" shows around ~89.3k.
Please reduce or turn off filtering in the OpenShares report and re-run OpenAccess to regenerate the grid and chart.
Have we checked the table SA_FS_OpenAccess_SharesRanked for any Open Shares not in the report? A screenshot or export of this could be helpful
