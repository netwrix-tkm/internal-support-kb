"500Qk00000CF1wAIAT","00412846","Support Ticket","NAS Migration","My organization has migrated to a new network storage platform, Isilion to NetApp. How do I migrate our current sensitive data and activity data so we don't lose anything?","","","","[Initial Issue]
Customer is migrating NAS from Isilon to Netapp and wants to ensure they don't lose any data.

[Initial Resolution]
Customer is using a new name for the Netapp, so there shouldn't be any need to migrate the data, as that will all remain in the database under the old servers name and still searchable in the AIC.

[Secondary Issue]
New NAS means they'll need to set up permissions and connect NEA and NAM

[Secondary Resolution]
I provided the customer with links to documentation for setting up correct Permissions and Activity for the new NetApp server","Guidance","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for NetApp","Configuration","11.5","","13.8","Closed - Resolved","Frankenmuth Mutual Insurance Company","Jerad Ware","2024-06-24T20:35:40.000Z","2024-07-08T15:30:39.000Z"
