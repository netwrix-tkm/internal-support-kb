"500Qk00000BwG9KIAV","00412112","Support Ticket","2-FSAA Bulk Import taking 10+ hours","The 2-FSAA Bulk Import had been taking 3-4 hours (The bulk of the time is for the resolve links), but improved to just about 35 minutes last month . Unclear why the change, but today it was taking over 10 hours and I had to eventually stop the scheduled job as it was causing latency for other queries on the SQL server. 

Can we determine the source of why it was taking so long? And/or ways we can keep it optimize to just < 35 minues?","","","","Confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                          11.5.0.260          Repair install date 2024/6/12

The only change noted since the Repair on 6/12 was KB5037763 installed on the SQL host similar issue occurred on 5/22 possible related to the update installed on 5/18

Found over lapping names  in the selected host list.

Per Andy this was needed to mitigate issues as these should be cleaned up or merged together to remove the duplicate host in the list.
