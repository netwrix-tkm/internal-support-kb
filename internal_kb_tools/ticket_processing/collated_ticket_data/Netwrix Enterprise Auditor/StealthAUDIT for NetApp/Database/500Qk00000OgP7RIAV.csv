---------------
Upgraded NEA to 12.0 then ran the FS Create Schema job per standard post upgrade procedure.
Create Schema job hangs at final analysis task: 18.Data Migration > SQL script 1 of 3.

Confirmed in SSMS that query is running but it seems to run indefinitely.","post 12.0 upgrade
run FS Create Schema job","create schema job still just hangs on the 18.Data Migration SQL script 1 of 3 step
the logs, even in debug, just hang at that point with no updates until the job is aborted

the job ran all weekend then timed out at 72 hours

client is running the FS_MigrateSchema job then will try the create schema job again

bulk import fails with errors (expected because create schema has to run first)","asked client if FS_MigrateSchema job helped","Issue:
Post 12.0 upgrade
FS Create Schema job hang indefinitely on analysis task 18.Data Migration

Resolution:
Ran FS_Migradeschema instant job
then Create Schema completed successfully.","Database Configuration/Capacity","Joshua Sexton","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for NetApp","Database","12.0","1070","8.1","Closed - Resolved","US Department of Treasury-Office of the Comptroller of the Currency","Eugene Johnson","2025-05-01T18:17:08.000Z","2025-05-09T20:18:05.000Z"
