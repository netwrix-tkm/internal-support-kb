@Michael Burrofato @Sanjay Meghani @Benjamin Warren @Farrah Gamboa @Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer The product will not change the type of an existing column, so if the customer has changed the MSGID column type to BIGINT, it will not be reverted, but when creating a new database or recreating the SA_Messages table the MSGID column will still be created as INT until this change is made on our end.
