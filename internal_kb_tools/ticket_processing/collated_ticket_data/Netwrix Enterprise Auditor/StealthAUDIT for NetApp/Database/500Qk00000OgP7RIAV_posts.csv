---------------
Upgraded NEA to 12.0 then ran the FS Create Schema job per standard post upgrade procedure.
Create Schema job hangs at final analysis task: 18.Data Migration > SQL script 1 of 3.

Confirmed in SSMS that query is running but it seems to run indefinitely.","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2025-05-01T18:17:10.000Z"

the logs, even in debug, just hang at that point with no updates until the job is aborted

the job ran all weekend then timed out at 72 hours

client is running the FS_MigrateSchema job then will try the create schema job again

bulk import fails with errors (expected because create schema has to run first)","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2025-05-06T14:08:42.000Z"
