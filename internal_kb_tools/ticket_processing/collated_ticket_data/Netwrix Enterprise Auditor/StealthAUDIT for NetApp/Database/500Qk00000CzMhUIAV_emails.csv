Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

I suspect based on the time of the DBMaintenancePlan_Index.Subplan_1 job run at 7:38:31 AM is the same time frame for your Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job is streaming data to the DB in question.

Most of the jobs do have a Drop ""IF  EXISTS ....      DROP"" as part of there analysis.

Please have the DBA send the index query for the one in my lab list DROP_EXISTING = OFF

If the Tables Indexes have not been altered then the task should be default and expected.

Thank You for your time.

I am still waiting for the setting we asked for but they sent me this in the meantime. I have no idea what they mean:



Hi John,
             While monitoring the index maintenance job on the server,



  1.  We see SPID 72 running the below SP is running for more than 40 hrs that was too long. When we check for the execution plan for this, we see it is recommending creating the below index highlighted below. Can you please review it.


  CREATE PROCEDURE SA_FS_DetermineOwnershipResources @HostID INT,   @NestedLevel INT  AS  IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#tmpF') IS NOT NULL  BEGIN   DROP TABLE #tmpF  END;    IF object_id(N'SA_FS_OwnershipResources', 'U') IS NOT NULL  BEGIN   DROP TABLE SA_FS_OwnershipResources  END;    SELECT g.[HOST],   rf.[ResourceID],   rf.NestedLevel  INTO #tmpF  FROM SA_FSAA_Gates g  OUTER APPLY dbo.SA_FSAA_ProbableOwners_RecurseFolders(g.[HOST], g.[FolderID], @NestedLevel) rf  WHERE [HOST] = @hostID   AND GateType = 0   AND g.DeletedUSN IS NULL;    CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IDX_tmpf ON #tmpF (   Host,   ResourceID   ) INCLUDE (NestedLevel);    SELECT tf.[HOST] [HostID],   tf.[ResourceID] [FolderID],   rf.[ResourceID] [ResourceID],   rf.[OwnerID],   tf.NestedLevel,   fs.[FileCount]  INTO SA_FS_OwnershipResources  FROM #tmpF tf  OUTER APPLY dbo.SA_FSAA_ProbableOwners_RecurseFolders(@hostid, tf.[ResourceID], 1000) rf  LEFT JOIN SA_FSAA_FileSizes fs   ON fs.HOST = tf.host    AND fs.ResourceID = rf.[ResourceID]  OPTION (MAXRECURSION 1000);    CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IDX_ownershipResources ON SA_FS_OwnershipResources (ResourceID) INCLUDE (   HostID,   FolderID,   NestedLevel   );

[cid:image001.png@01DAD693.494535A0]

/*
Missing Index Details from ExecutionPlan1.sqlplan
The Query Processor estimates that implementing the following index could improve the query cost by 94.8282%.
*/

/*
USE [StealthAudit]
GO
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [<Name of Missing Index, sysname,>]
ON [dbo].[SA_FSAA_Resources] ([HOST],[ParentResourceID],[ResourceType])
INCLUDE ([OwnerID])
GO
*/





  1.  When checking for the missing index at the database level, we see below index recommendation on SA_FSAA_Resources table which was also called by the below select under the SPID 56 which also ran for more than 8 hours. So, please review this


SELECT   [HostID] , [ID] , [ResourceID] , [ResourceType] , [ParentResourceID] , [ProcessID] , [Operation] , [Allow] , [TargetResourceID] , [TargetResourceName] , [TargetParentResourceID] , [TargetPath] , [UserID] , [UserSID] , [UserNTDomain] , [UserType] , [UserPrincipalID] , [UserTypeDescription] , [UserNTStyleName] , [AccessTime] , [UserDisplayName] , [UserNTName] , [HostName] , [Path] , [ResourceName] , [ResourceTypeDescription] , [ProcessName] , [OperationDescription] , [AllowDescription]                         FROM [dbo].[SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView]                        WHERE ((isnull(CharIndex(N'kcrous04', ""UserNTName""), 0) > 0) And (""AccessTime"" > Cast('20240103' as datetime))) ORDER BY [AccessTime] DESC


[cid:image003.png@01DAD693.494535A0]



CREATE INDEX IX_MI_SA_FSAA_Resources_62_61 ON [StealthAudit].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_Resources] ([HOST], [ParentResourceID],[ResourceType]) INCLUDE ([OwnerID])


                  Please let us know in case of any concerns.

Ioannis,

Thank you for reaching out to support.

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR

I suspect based on the time of the DBMaintenancePlan_Index.Subplan_1 job run at 7:38:31 AM is the same time frame for your Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job is streaming data to the DB in question.

Most of the jobs do have a Drop ""IF  EXISTS ....      DROP"" as part of there analysis.

Please have the DBA send the index query for the one in my lab list DROP_EXISTING = OFF

If the Tables Indexes have not been altered then the task should be default and expected.

Thank You for your time.

I am still waiting for the setting we asked for but they sent me this in the meantime. I have no idea what they mean:

 

 

 

Hi John,

             While monitoring the index maintenance job on the server,

 

 


	We see SPID 72 running the below SP is running for more than 40 hrs that was too long. When we check for the execution plan for this, we see it is recommending creating the below index highlighted below. Can you please review it.


 

 

  CREATE PROCEDURE SA_FS_DetermineOwnershipResources @HostID INT,   @NestedLevel INT  AS  IF OBJECT_ID('tempdb..#tmpF') IS NOT NULL  BEGIN   DROP TABLE #tmpF  END;    IF object_id(N'SA_FS_OwnershipResources', 'U') IS NOT NULL  BEGIN   DROP TABLE SA_FS_OwnershipResources  END;    SELECT g.[HOST],   rf.[ResourceID],   rf.NestedLevel  INTO #tmpF  FROM SA_FSAA_Gates g  OUTER APPLY dbo.SA_FSAA_ProbableOwners_RecurseFolders(g.[HOST], g.[FolderID], @NestedLevel) rf  WHERE [HOST] = @hostID   AND GateType = 0   AND g.DeletedUSN IS NULL;    CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IDX_tmpf ON #tmpF (   Host,   ResourceID   ) INCLUDE (NestedLevel);    SELECT tf.[HOST] [HostID],   tf.[ResourceID] [FolderID],   rf.[ResourceID] [ResourceID],   rf.[OwnerID],   tf.NestedLevel,   fs.[FileCount]  INTO SA_FS_OwnershipResources  FROM #tmpF tf  OUTER APPLY dbo.SA_FSAA_ProbableOwners_RecurseFolders(@hostid, tf.[ResourceID], 1000) rf  LEFT JOIN SA_FSAA_FileSizes fs   ON fs.HOST = tf.host    AND fs.ResourceID = rf.[ResourceID]  OPTION (MAXRECURSION 1000);    CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IDX_ownershipResources ON SA_FS_OwnershipResources (ResourceID) INCLUDE (   HostID,   FolderID,   NestedLevel   );

 



 

 

 

 



 

 

/*

Missing Index Details from ExecutionPlan1.sqlplan

The Query Processor estimates that implementing the following index could improve the query cost by 94.8282%.

*/

 

/*

USE [StealthAudit]

GO

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX [<Name of Missing Index, sysname,>]

ON [dbo].[SA_FSAA_Resources] ([HOST],[ParentResourceID],[ResourceType])

INCLUDE ([OwnerID])

GO

*/

 

 

 

 


	When checking for the missing index at the database level, we see below index recommendation on SA_FSAA_Resources table which was also called by the below select under the SPID 56 which also ran for more than 8 hours. So, please review this


 

 

SELECT   [HostID] , [ID] , [ResourceID] , [ResourceType] , [ParentResourceID] , [ProcessID] , [Operation] , [Allow] , [TargetResourceID] , [TargetResourceName] , [TargetParentResourceID] , [TargetPath] , [UserID] , [UserSID] , [UserNTDomain] , [UserType] , [UserPrincipalID] , [UserTypeDescription] , [UserNTStyleName] , [AccessTime] , [UserDisplayName] , [UserNTName] , [HostName] , [Path] , [ResourceName] , [ResourceTypeDescription] , [ProcessName] , [OperationDescription] , [AllowDescription]                         FROM [dbo].[SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView]                        WHERE ((isnull(CharIndex(N'kcrous04', ""UserNTName""), 0) > 0) And (""AccessTime"" > Cast('20240103' as datetime))) ORDER BY [AccessTime] DESC

 

 



 

 

 

CREATE INDEX IX_MI_SA_FSAA_Resources_62_61 ON [StealthAudit].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_Resources] ([HOST], [ParentResourceID],[ResourceType]) INCLUDE ([OwnerID])

 

 

                  Please let us know in case of any concerns.

 

 

 

                Thanks & Regards,

Ioannis,

Thank You for the update.
It would be the settings in the IDX_SA_ADInventory_Principals_Display index for the DBA to send over for review.

Again, thank You for your time.

Ioannis,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:

Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

I suspect based on the time of the DBMaintenancePlan_Index.Subplan_1 job run at 7:38:31 AM is the same time frame for your Active Directory Inventory (ADI) job is streaming data to the DB in question.

Most of the jobs do have a Drop ""IF  EXISTS ....      DROP"" as part of there analysis.

Please have the DBA send the index query for the one in my lab list DROP_EXISTING =  OFF

If the Tables Indexes have not been altered then the task should be default and expected.
