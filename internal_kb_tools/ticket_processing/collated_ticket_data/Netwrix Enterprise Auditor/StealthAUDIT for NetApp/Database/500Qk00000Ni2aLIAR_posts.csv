Customer in Question has over 70 Proxies and 100+ File Servers that all seem to list 1k+ per host/share Warnings and Errors during a scans.

SEEK scans are trying to Parse up to 50mb file size.

This then seems to prevent the import from working as the SA_Messages needs to be truncated for the import job Warnings and Errors.

Robert Minichino:  The product will not change the type of an existing column, so if the customer has changed the MSGID column type to BIGINT, it will not be reverted, but when creating a new database or recreating the SA_Messages table the MSGID column will still be created as INT until this change is made on our end.
