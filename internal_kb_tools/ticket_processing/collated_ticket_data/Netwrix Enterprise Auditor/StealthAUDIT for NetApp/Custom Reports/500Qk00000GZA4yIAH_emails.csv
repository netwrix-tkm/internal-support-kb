Hey Frank,

I hope this message finds you well. Would it be possible for us to reschedule our meeting originally planned for 2pm ET today? Unfortunately, a family emergency has arisen, and I will not be available at that time.

I am available later this week (Thursday and Friday) and would be happy to accommodate your schedule as best as I can. You can use the link below to reschedule:

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and greatly appreciate your understanding. Please let me know what works best for you.

Thanks Tay for your time.  I’m sending the below info to my team so we can start changing the info on the agents tab. Once support finds a way to apply the same credentials on all the Monitored Host it will save us soooooo much time as we won’t have to change the PW on all of them 😊

Hey Frank,

I've got that report ready for you- let's schedule some time to add it:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=NcG3gmndKdpq908uduCvwSLSpiNPH2bYw5335fTHkWY-Z&MeetingID=39pzReqomKYSD4FT8H90J2G_MbCe5KpsZlBojlx06lo-Z

I also MIGHT have a way to make password changes easier for Netwrix Activity monitor that we can discuss as well.

​​​​​​​Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hey Frank,

I hope this message finds you well. Would it be possible for us to reschedule our meeting originally planned for 2pm ET today? Unfortunately, a family emergency has arisen, and I will not be available at that time.

I am available later this week (Thursday and Friday) and would be happy to accommodate your schedule as best as I can. You can use the link below to reschedule:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=yd_qe9V6aa.AZ6QpijEFcxQKNGq0bfJdneJfcPq1YJ0-Z&MeetingID=_P_.38sc2V5d98mEXUyTPsWSYx4In8u3HnR4kdaxoU4-Z

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and greatly appreciate your understanding. Please let me know what works best for you.

Thank you,

P.S.

How do you tell the gender of an ant?

Put it in a glass of water. If it sinks it’s a girl ant. If it floats it’s buoyant!

Thanks Tay for all of your assistance! I’m so looking forward to receiving my report over the weekend 😊

I do have a question on the password change. We added the security group to the administrators group that contains the svc_varonis account

[cid:image001.png@01DB9CDA.777D8540]

Note we changed it on the highlighted server.
Do I need to add the group that contains the svc_varonis account to the administrator’s group for each agent listed (i.e. svgwapt1292)?

I received my official red rider report with a compass in the stock this morning. Is there an easy way to ensure we have all the host reporting? I would have thought I would have seen more host in the report.

Hey Tay - thanks for the reminder as I'm getting old and forgetful.

Now what were we discussing??:? oh yes... I made some permission changes on the following folder: \bvlnafs1bvl1Access_Management_Script-EEF210TeamFrank<file://bvlnafs1/bvl1/Access_Management_Script-EEF210/Team/Frank>
I broke permissions and removed a few security groups. Based on this, it should generate a new report.

Speaking of reports, we need to go in and disable the first report as I'm getting two emails.

Thanks again!

Good Morning Tay,

I received my official red rider report with a compass in the stock this morning. Is there an easy way to ensure we have all the host reporting? I would have thought I would have seen more host in the report.

Thanks again
Frankster

Hey Frank,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

  1.  Created a report for weekly permission shares

Here is the other info regarding updating the Management Group in Activity Monitor, when the time comes -> feel free to open another ticket and we can hang out on standby while you make the switch!

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/ActivityMonitor_8.0/page/Content/ActivityMonitor/Admin/Agents/Properties/Connection.htm

I'm going to go ahead and get this ticket closed out, but if anything crazy happens with the report, just email me back and we'll get it worked out.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hey Tay – thanks for the reminder as I’m getting old and forgetful.

 

Now what were we discussing??:? oh yes… I made some permission changes on the following folder: \bvlnafs1bvl1Access_Management_Script-EEF210TeamFrank

I broke permissions and removed a few security groups. Based on this, it should generate a new report. 

 

Speaking of reports, we need to go in and disable the first report as I’m getting two emails.

 

Thanks again!

Frankster

Sounds like a plan Stan 😊

Also, I created two tickets for our other issues (error report and the connection/key issue) which makes me a little nervous….

Take care!
