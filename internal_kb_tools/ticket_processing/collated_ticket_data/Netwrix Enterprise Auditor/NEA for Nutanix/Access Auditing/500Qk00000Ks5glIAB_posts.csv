Asked to do this test:
1. Connect to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server. 

2. On this server open File Explorer. 

3. Enter UNC path that leads to Nutanix share in question so it would look similar to this:
\ipaddressshare
Enter credentials that are used in the account from the Enterprise Auditor connection profile (the service account with ""Backup Admin: Backup Access"" role assigned to it in Nutanix).

4. Please, let me know if you are able to open the share in question using same credentials via File Explorer on the Enterprise Auditor server.

And provide answers to these questions:
1. Do you have ""Filesystem Allowlist"" configured in Nutanix?

2. Does this list include the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server?","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-02-03T10:12:50.000Z"

Customer is on 11.6.0.117 NEA. 

On a remote session we checked NEA and Nutanix configuration for FSAA scan. 
both NEA and Nutanix are configured in accordance with our user guide, which are:
-Active directory account in the connection profile.
-the account needs to have the assigned ""Backup Admin: Backup Access"" (Nutanix built-in role) for least privilege or ""admin"" rights.
-Target host should be Nutanix host/hosts.

I had a conversation with Chris Brooks (Product Manager). He suggested checking the following:

1. Connect to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server. 
2. On this server open File Explorer. 
3. Enter UNC path that leads to Nutanix share in question so it would look similar to this:
\ipaddressshare
Enter credentials that are used in the account from the Enterprise Auditor connection profile (the service account with ""Backup Admin: Backup Access"" role assigned to it in Nutanix).

And this:
1. Do you have ""Filesystem Allowlist"" configured in Nutanix?
2. Does this list include the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server? 

Customer replied with results:
""We have done this testing by accessing UNC path from EA server and it is accessible.
Netwrix EA server is added in allow list and has permission to access.""

As per conversation with Chris Brooks, he suggested escalating this ticket to developers at this point.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-02-05T14:52:18.000Z"
