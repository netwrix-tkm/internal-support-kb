I had a conversation with Chris Brooks (Product Manager). He suggested checking the following:

1. Connect to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server. 
2. On this server open File Explorer. 
3. Enter UNC path that leads to Nutanix share in question so it would look similar to this:
\ipaddressshare
Enter credentials that are used in the account from the Enterprise Auditor connection profile (the service account with ""Backup Admin: Backup Access"" role assigned to it in Nutanix).

And this:
1. Do you have ""Filesystem Allowlist"" configured in Nutanix?
2. Does this list include the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server? 

Customer replied with results:
""We have done this testing by accessing UNC path from EA server and it is accessible.
Netwrix EA server is added in allow list and has permission to access.""

As per conversation with Chris Brooks, he suggested escalating this ticket to developers at this point.","Support is preparing ticket for escalation.","Cause
Configuration issue on customer's side, correct permissions were not applied

Resolution
After setting up permissions, customer advised to close the ticket","Incorrect configuration: target server software","Damir Akhmatshin","Error","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","NEA for Nutanix","Access Auditing","11.6","11.6.0.117","41.1","Closed - Resolved","The Saudi Investment Bank (SAIB)","Pramod Sawant","2025-01-21T05:20:34.000Z","2025-03-03T07:29:51.000Z"
