Our SharePoint Online Auditor application's secret key recently expired. I generated a new client secret in Entra AD and updated it within the Netwrix Auditor console.

After updating the secret, the SharePoint scan is not running successfully.

I've attached relevant screenshots for your reference. Could you please assist in verifying the configuration and resolve the issue?","Update secret for sharepoint application credentials.
