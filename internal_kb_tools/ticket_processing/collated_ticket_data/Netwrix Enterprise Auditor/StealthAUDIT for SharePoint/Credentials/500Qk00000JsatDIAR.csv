We have recently migrated our on-prem user home directories to OneDrive and I need to create permissions reports for our users. Unfortunately, I am not seeing all subdirectories. I currently see Social, Documents, Form Template and Style Library. How can I see all subdirectories in and their permissions if shared with other users?","","Jobs were overlapping causing host resource issues.","Awaiting for the next set of scans complete.","Confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.6.0.112

Created the new App-registrations and Cert for the connection: Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Jobs Tree > Instant Job Wizard > SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job

Our Tier 2 (Tay) was able to correct my configuration error for this job.

Once this completed and the new Connection Profile was in place and the console was restarted and a Zero level Job was tested.
Zero level scan was Successful.

We shifted the SPO scans to run one after another from the Parent folder >> Jobs >> SharePoint
This will keep the Collection jobs 5-SPAA_BulkImport, 6-SPAC_BulkImport, 7-SPAA_Exceptions, and Reporting from stepping on each other within the SQL DB

Corrected the profile for the SPAC_SystemScans.","Incorrect configuration: target server software","Dusty Grayson","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for SharePoint","Credentials","11.6","112","28.9","Closed - Resolved","The Baupost Group","Charlie Davidson","2024-12-24T17:53:26.000Z","2025-01-22T15:04:01.000Z"
