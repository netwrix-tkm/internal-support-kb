Hi Ilya

Could we have a really quick meeting to discuss this,  I started writing a war and peace email but I just think it might raise more questions than answers and a quick call might work better,

Many Thanks

Thank you for your time today! On this meeting we have reviewed the process of safely testing any potential improvements to jobs that Analyze data, i.e. run only analysis, not query. Since your DBA flagged exactly that job, you can do the following:

1) Make a copy of the job, so you have a working backup
2) Rename the copy to your liking (appending _DBA_Test for example)
3) Navigate to that Job's Configuration > Analysis
4) Select the Analysis and press the Analysis Configuration link
5) Ask your DBA Team to modify the query, save it
6) Run the resulting Job and see if it functions/improved.



Netwrix Support endorses trying to make improvements according to the scale and parameters of your environment, given that you have backups of the original job, so that you can safely revert to a working one in case the improvements affect functionality in any way.

Please let me know if you're good to close this case off.

Have a great day,
Ilya Kotov
