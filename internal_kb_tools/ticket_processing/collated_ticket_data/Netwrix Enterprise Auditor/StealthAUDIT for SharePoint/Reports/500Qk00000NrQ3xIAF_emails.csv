Hi Ilya,
Its just a few general things we are interested in.

- is there any feature /functionality of Enterprise Auditor or Published reports that would enable us to show trends/ track data from the quarterly scans that we run

  *   How many scans information does Published Reports hold and for how long does it keep the data?
  *   When the last SharePoint scan was executed the following report for Broken Inheritance showed this, I was wondering why we are seeing this.

Many Thanks

Thank you!

Published reports allow to publish any reports to the Web Console, please refer to this article: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/Features.htm
You might need custom reports created for your quarterly data first, to be able to publish those, though.

Published Reports operate on the reports provided by your NEA console. Whenever the data changes in your console reports - it changes in published reports, so any settings for NEA will be the same for Web.

That report we will need to look at. Could you please upload that job's logs to this ticket so we could analyze them prior the the meeting (if it's going to be necessary).

Hi Ilya

Thanks for the quick reply. I have uploaded the log file for that job.

Hi thanks for the link as well I will have a read on Monday when I am back in the office, in the meantime can I just ask in response to your reply in blue below.

When we run a scan it basically overwrites/updates the data in both Netwrix auditor and Published reports and then retains this information until the next scan overwrites/updates it.
So basically there isn't really a way of retaining more than 1 scans information in Published reports/Netwrix auditor or any sort of GUI format.?
Management have been asking about tracking trends etc in the data in the quarterly scan and we are considering just building a dashboard in house but thought we would just initially check with you. ....Thanks  Nuala

If you have any questions on that article, please let me know. I'll check the files and will be back with an update.

As for retention, you can export any reports as solid files: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/View.htm

An additional feature available within the Web Console is the option to download data as a CSV file, which can be enabled for grid elements. This exports the data within tables, both interactive grid and plain HTML tables. See the Grid topic for additional information

Hi Ilya,

Its just a few general things we are interested in.

 

– is there any feature /functionality of Enterprise Auditor or Published reports that would enable us to show trends/ track data from the quarterly scans that we run

1.       How many scans information does Published Reports hold and for how long does it keep the data?

2.       When the last SharePoint scan was executed the following report for Broken Inheritance showed this, I was wondering why we are seeing this.

 

Many Thanks

Hi Ilya

I still need to read over the documentation that you sent, I will hopefully get to look at it tomorrow.
I was wondering if you got a chance to look at the log file I sent in relation to why the report didn't generate.

Many Thanks
Nuala

Nuala,

If you have any questions on that article, please let me know. I'll check the files and will be back with an update.

As for retention, you can export any reports as solid files: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/View.htm

An additional feature available within the Web Console is the option to download data as a CSV file, which can be enabled for grid elements. This exports the data within tables, both interactive grid and plain HTML tables. See the Grid<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/Wizard/Widgets.htm#Grid> topic for additional information

Hi Ilya

Thanks for the quick reply. I have uploaded the log file for that job.

Hi thanks for the link as well I will have a read on Monday when I am back in the office, in the meantime can I just ask in response to your reply in blue below.

When we run a scan it basically overwrites/updates the data in both Netwrix auditor and Published reports and then retains this information until the next scan overwrites/updates it.
So basically there isn't really a way of retaining more than 1 scans information in Published reports/Netwrix auditor or any sort of GUI format.?
Management have been asking about tracking trends etc in the data in the quarterly scan and we are considering just building a dashboard in house but thought we would just initially check with you. ....Thanks  Nuala

Published reports allow to publish any reports to the Web Console, please refer to this article: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/Features.htm
You might need custom reports created for your quarterly data first, to be able to publish those, though.

Published Reports operate on the reports provided by your NEA console. Whenever the data changes in your console reports - it changes in published reports, so any settings for NEA will be the same for Web.

Hi Ilya,
Its just a few general things we are interested in.

- is there any feature /functionality of Enterprise Auditor or Published reports that would enable us to show trends/ track data from the quarterly scans that we run

1.      How many scans information does Published Reports hold and for how long does it keep the data?

2.      When the last SharePoint scan was executed the following report for Broken Inheritance showed this, I was wondering why we are seeing this.

Many Thanks
Nuala

– is there any feature /functionality of Enterprise Auditor or Published reports that would enable us to show trends/ track data from the quarterly scans that we run

1.      How many scans information does Published Reports hold and for how long does it keep the data?

2.      When the last SharePoint scan was executed the following report for Broken Inheritance showed this, I was wondering why we are seeing this.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Surely, but before I send you a meeting link, could you please provide some information about what exactly you want to find out about your SP Jobs? It would help a lot.

I've checked the log and everything seems to be in order with it. Could you please check the __source__ table for this report? (i.e. the table this report uses to populate itself) Does it contain any data?

Hi Ilya

I still need to read over the documentation that you sent, I will hopefully get to look at it tomorrow.
I was wondering if you got a chance to look at the log file I sent in relation to why the report didn't generate.

Many Thanks

Nuala,

If you have any questions on that article, please let me know. I'll check the files and will be back with an update.

As for retention, you can export any reports as solid files: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/View.htm

An additional feature available within the Web Console is the option to download data as a CSV file, which can be enabled for grid elements. This exports the data within tables, both interactive grid and plain HTML tables. See the Grid<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/Wizard/Widgets.htm#Grid> topic for additional information

Hi Ilya

Thanks for the quick reply. I have uploaded the log file for that job.

Hi thanks for the link as well I will have a read on Monday when I am back in the office, in the meantime can I just ask in response to your reply in blue below.

When we run a scan it basically overwrites/updates the data in both Netwrix auditor and Published reports and then retains this information until the next scan overwrites/updates it.
So basically there isn't really a way of retaining more than 1 scans information in Published reports/Netwrix auditor or any sort of GUI format.?
Management have been asking about tracking trends etc in the data in the quarterly scan and we are considering just building a dashboard in house but thought we would just initially check with you. ....Thanks  Nuala

Published reports allow to publish any reports to the Web Console, please refer to this article: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/Features.htm
You might need custom reports created for your quarterly data first, to be able to publish those, though.

Published Reports operate on the reports provided by your NEA console. Whenever the data changes in your console reports - it changes in published reports, so any settings for NEA will be the same for Web.

I've checked the log and everything seems to be in order with it. Could you please check the __source__ table for this report? (i.e. the table this report uses to populate itself) Does it contain any data?

I still need to read over the documentation that you sent, I will hopefully get to look at it tomorrow.
I was wondering if you got a chance to look at the log file I sent in relation to why the report didn't generate.

Many Thanks

Nuala,

If you have any questions on that article, please let me know. I'll check the files and will be back with an update.

As for retention, you can export any reports as solid files: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/View.htm

An additional feature available within the Web Console is the option to download data as a CSV file, which can be enabled for grid elements. This exports the data within tables, both interactive grid and plain HTML tables. See the Grid<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/Wizard/Widgets.htm#Grid> topic for additional information

Hi Ilya

Thanks for the quick reply. I have uploaded the log file for that job.

Hi thanks for the link as well I will have a read on Monday when I am back in the office, in the meantime can I just ask in response to your reply in blue below.

When we run a scan it basically overwrites/updates the data in both Netwrix auditor and Published reports and then retains this information until the next scan overwrites/updates it.
So basically there isn't really a way of retaining more than 1 scans information in Published reports/Netwrix auditor or any sort of GUI format.?
Management have been asking about tracking trends etc in the data in the quarterly scan and we are considering just building a dashboard in house but thought we would just initially check with you. ....Thanks  Nuala

Published reports allow to publish any reports to the Web Console, please refer to this article: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/Features.htm
You might need custom reports created for your quarterly data first, to be able to publish those, though.

Published Reports operate on the reports provided by your NEA console. Whenever the data changes in your console reports - it changes in published reports, so any settings for NEA will be the same for Web.

Hi Ilya,
Its just a few general things we are interested in.

- is there any feature /functionality of Enterprise Auditor or Published reports that would enable us to show trends/ track data from the quarterly scans that we run

1.      How many scans information does Published Reports hold and for how long does it keep the data?

2.      When the last SharePoint scan was executed the following report for Broken Inheritance showed this, I was wondering why we are seeing this.

Many Thanks
Nuala

Hi Ilya

Many Thanks

Nuala

I've checked the log and everything seems to be in order with it. Could you please check the __source__ table for this report? (i.e. the table this report uses to populate itself) Does it contain any data?

Hi Ilya 

 

I still need to read over the documentation that you sent, I will hopefully get to look at it tomorrow. 

I was wondering if you got a chance to look at the log file I sent in relation to why the report didn’t generate.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala,

If you have any questions on that article, please let me know. I'll check the files and will be back with an update.

As for retention, you can export any reports as solid files: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/View.htm

An additional feature available within the Web Console is the option to download data as a CSV file, which can be enabled for grid elements. This exports the data within tables, both interactive grid and plain HTML tables. See the Grid topic for additional information

Hi Ilya

 

Thanks for the quick reply. I have uploaded the log file for that job.

 

Hi thanks for the link as well I will have a read on Monday when I am back in the office, in the meantime can I just ask in response to your reply in blue below.

 

When we run a scan it basically overwrites/updates the data in both Netwrix auditor and Published reports and then retains this information until the next scan overwrites/updates it.

So basically there isn’t really a way of retaining more than 1 scans information in Published reports/Netwrix auditor or any sort of GUI format.?

Management have been asking about tracking trends etc in the data in the quarterly scan and we are considering just building a dashboard in house but thought we would just initially check with you. ….Thanks  Nuala

 

Published reports allow to publish any reports to the Web Console, please refer to this article: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/Features.htm
You might need custom reports created for your quarterly data first, to be able to publish those, though.

Published Reports operate on the reports provided by your NEA console. Whenever the data changes in your console reports - it changes in published reports, so any settings for NEA will be the same for Web.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NrQ3x:ref

 


Hi Ilya,

Its just a few general things we are interested in.

 

– is there any feature /functionality of Enterprise Auditor or Published reports that would enable us to show trends/ track data from the quarterly scans that we run

1.      How many scans information does Published Reports hold and for how long does it keep the data?

2.      When the last SharePoint scan was executed the following report for Broken Inheritance showed this, I was wondering why we are seeing this.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala

Hello Stealth,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Surely, but before I send you a meeting link, could you please provide some information about what exactly you want to find out about your SP Jobs? It would help a lot.

Published reports allow to publish any reports to the Web Console, please refer to this article: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/Features.htm
You might need custom reports created for your quarterly data first, to be able to publish those, though.

Published Reports operate on the reports provided by your NEA console. Whenever the data changes in your console reports - it changes in published reports, so any settings for NEA will be the same for Web.

That report we will need to look at. Could you please upload that job's logs to this ticket so we could analyze them prior the the meeting (if it's going to be necessary).

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,
Its just a few general things we are interested in.

- is there any feature /functionality of Enterprise Auditor or Published reports that would enable us to show trends/ track data from the quarterly scans that we run

1.      How many scans information does Published Reports hold and for how long does it keep the data?

2.      When the last SharePoint scan was executed the following report for Broken Inheritance showed this, I was wondering why we are seeing this.

Many Thanks
Nuala

I've checked the log and everything seems to be in order with it. Could you please check the __source__ table for this report? (i.e. the table this report uses to populate itself) Does it contain any data?

Hi Ilya 

 

I still need to read over the documentation that you sent, I will hopefully get to look at it tomorrow. 

I was wondering if you got a chance to look at the log file I sent in relation to why the report didn’t generate.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala,

If you have any questions on that article, please let me know. I'll check the files and will be back with an update.

As for retention, you can export any reports as solid files: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/View.htm

An additional feature available within the Web Console is the option to download data as a CSV file, which can be enabled for grid elements. This exports the data within tables, both interactive grid and plain HTML tables. See the Grid topic for additional information

Ilya Kotov

Hi Ilya

 

Thanks for the quick reply. I have uploaded the log file for that job.

 

Hi thanks for the link as well I will have a read on Monday when I am back in the office, in the meantime can I just ask in response to your reply in blue below.

 

When we run a scan it basically overwrites/updates the data in both Netwrix auditor and Published reports and then retains this information until the next scan overwrites/updates it.

So basically there isn’t really a way of retaining more than 1 scans information in Published reports/Netwrix auditor or any sort of GUI format.?

Management have been asking about tracking trends etc in the data in the quarterly scan and we are considering just building a dashboard in house but thought we would just initially check with you. ….Thanks  Nuala

 

Published reports allow to publish any reports to the Web Console, please refer to this article: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/Features.htm
You might need custom reports created for your quarterly data first, to be able to publish those, though.

Published Reports operate on the reports provided by your NEA console. Whenever the data changes in your console reports - it changes in published reports, so any settings for NEA will be the same for Web.

Nuala,

What is your complete version and build of NEA? We need to check if it's version related.

Nuala,

I've checked the log and everything seems to be in order with it. Could you please check the __source__ table for this report? (i.e. the table this report uses to populate itself) Does it contain any data?

Hi Ilya 

 

I still need to read over the documentation that you sent, I will hopefully get to look at it tomorrow. 

I was wondering if you got a chance to look at the log file I sent in relation to why the report didn’t generate.

 

Many Thanks 

Nuala

Nuala,

If you have any questions on that article, please let me know. I'll check the files and will be back with an update.

As for retention, you can export any reports as solid files: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/View.htm

An additional feature available within the Web Console is the option to download data as a CSV file, which can be enabled for grid elements. This exports the data within tables, both interactive grid and plain HTML tables. See the Grid topic for additional information

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Hi Ilya

 

Thanks for the quick reply. I have uploaded the log file for that job.

 

Hi thanks for the link as well I will have a read on Monday when I am back in the office, in the meantime can I just ask in response to your reply in blue below.

 

When we run a scan it basically overwrites/updates the data in both Netwrix auditor and Published reports and then retains this information until the next scan overwrites/updates it.

So basically there isn’t really a way of retaining more than 1 scans information in Published reports/Netwrix auditor or any sort of GUI format.?

Management have been asking about tracking trends etc in the data in the quarterly scan and we are considering just building a dashboard in house but thought we would just initially check with you. ….Thanks  Nuala

 

Published reports allow to publish any reports to the Web Console, please refer to this article: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/Features.htm
You might need custom reports created for your quarterly data first, to be able to publish those, though.

Published Reports operate on the reports provided by your NEA console. Whenever the data changes in your console reports - it changes in published reports, so any settings for NEA will be the same for Web.

That report we will need to look at. Could you please upload that job's logs to this ticket so we could analyze them prior the the meeting (if it's going to be necessary).

Hi Ilya,

Its just a few general things we are interested in.

 

– is there any feature /functionality of Enterprise Auditor or Published reports that would enable us to show trends/ track data from the quarterly scans that we run

1.      How many scans information does Published Reports hold and for how long does it keep the data?

2.      When the last SharePoint scan was executed the following report for Broken Inheritance showed this, I was wondering why we are seeing this.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala

Hello Stealth,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Surely, but before I send you a meeting link, could you please provide some information about what exactly you want to find out about your SP Jobs? It would help a lot.
