1) Based upon the information provided, it seems as though you would want the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer solution for NEA (NAA) which it does not appear as though you do based upon what I see in your account in Salesforce.

In NEA (NAA) if you navigate to ""Help"" > ""About"" in the popup you would see ""Active Directory Permissions""

Hello Ashish,

Our professional services team would have to build this report as referenced in the ticket under a Professional Service contract/agreement. To accomplish this, we will need to get on a call with Professional Services and yourself to ensure the scope of the request is agreed upon. The ProServ team can then build a SOW and a quotation and can proceed with final review with you, and I assume Tony. Once approved and signed by Alcon, we can start the project.

@ashish.sharma@alcon.com<mailto:ashish.sharma@alcon.com>, Is this how you would like to proceed?
