Hello Paul,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00424453. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00424453
Ticket Subject: SharePoint Online Reporting
Ticket Details: We categorize our SharePoint scans into four site collection groups: Communication, Teams, Personal, and Others. The reports within the console categorize the data collected from scans by SharePoint, Teams, and OneDrive. Is there a way to edit/create reports that show data reflecting how we categorize our sites? We'd also like show the total percentage breakdown of sensitive data by site collection.

Thank you!

Joshua Sexton
Technical Support Engineer
