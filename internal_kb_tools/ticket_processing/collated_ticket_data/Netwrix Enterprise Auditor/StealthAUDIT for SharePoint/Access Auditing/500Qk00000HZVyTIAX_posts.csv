[C:18059] Unable to perform bulk import Error: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint ""FK_SA_SPAA_Trustees_SiteCollectionId"". The conflict occurred in the database ""StealthauditDB"", table ""dbo.SA_SPAA_Resources"".

We have previously identified this error before on the 11.6 version of NEA and resolving this issue involved dropping all SPO tabels and re-running the SPAA System Scans and Bulk Import jobs again. Since then this issue has returned. 

We performed a FK validation check on both the SA_SPAA_Resources table and the SA_SPAA_Trustees tables using the dynamic management view command below:

use [database name]
dbcc checkconstraints (table_name);
go

This ran successfully and did not display any errors on both tables.

We collected all artifacts listed below:
