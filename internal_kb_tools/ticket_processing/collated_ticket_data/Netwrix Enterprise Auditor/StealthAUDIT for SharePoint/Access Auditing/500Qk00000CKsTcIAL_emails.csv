Hello Victor,

We are still a bit unclear. So one drive can be used to scan. However we are looking to implement stealth bits as a permissions control. Right now we can set it up so that we have owners over resources and change permissions for people based on AD groups. Is this something that can be used in correlation with One drive? We understand that scans may be able to take place. But just in terms of owners controlling there resources and who has access and who can request access to specific resources.

Thanks,
Paul Kyles

Hi Tay,

Thank you very much for your help on this ticket.

Since the holiday is coming up and July is the last month of the quarter for us, can we get confirmation on this request this week?

Management is motivated to offer customers incentives to add NEA modules this month.

Hi Team,

I'm checking into whether the AIC/NEA has the capability to do Resource Reviews/Access Reviews on OneDrive.

At the very least, for OneDrive it would require the SharePoint module for NEA.

Thank you,

Hello Victor,

We are still a bit unclear. So one drive can be used to scan. However we are looking to implement stealth bits as a permissions control. Right now we can set it up so that we have owners over resources and change permissions for people based on AD groups. Is this something that can be used in correlation with One drive? We understand that scans may be able to take place. But just in terms of owners controlling there resources and who has access and who can request access to specific resources.

Thanks,
Paul Kyles

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #413153 - - File System Cloud Storage/One Drive migration from on-prem [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0CKsTc:ref ]

Hello Victor,

We are still a bit unclear. So one drive can be used to scan. However we are looking to implement stealth bits as a permissions control. Right now we can set it up so that we have owners over resources and change permissions for people based on AD groups. Is this something that can be used in correlation with One drive? We understand that scans may be able to take place. But just in terms of owners controlling there resources and who has access and who can request access to specific resources.

Thanks,
Paul Kyles

Hello Victor,

We are still a bit unclear. So one drive can be used to scan. However we are looking to implement stealth bits as a permissions control. Right now we can set it up so that we have owners over resources and change permissions for people based on AD groups. Is this something that can be used in correlation with One drive? We understand that scans may be able to take place. But just in terms of owners controlling there resources and who has access and who can request access to specific resources.

Thanks,
Paul Kyles

Hello Victor,

We are still a bit unclear. So one drive can be used to scan. However we are looking to implement stealth bits as a permissions control. Right now we can set it up so that we have owners over resources and change permissions for people based on AD groups. Is this something that can be used in correlation with One drive? We understand that scans may be able to take place. But just in terms of owners controlling there resources and who has access and who can request access to specific resources.

Thanks,
Paul Kyles

Hi Team, I'm checking into whether the AIC/NEA has the capability to do Resource Reviews/Access Reviews on OneDrive. At the very least, for OneDrive it would require the SharePoint module for NEA. Thank you, Tay Caliguiri Senior Technical

Hello Victor,

 

We are still a bit unclear. So one drive can be used to scan. However we are looking to implement stealth bits as a permissions control. Right now we can set it up so that we have owners over resources and change permissions for people based on AD groups. Is this something that can be used in correlation with One drive? We understand that scans may be able to take place. But just in terms of owners controlling there resources and who has access and who can request access to specific resources. 

 

Thanks,

Paul Kyles

Hello, my name is Paul Kyle's. I work for Alpine Bank. We we have stealth bits. We used up. It's in our environment and our wanting to expand that with permissions and folder ownership and that stuff really kind of our main question going forward right now.

So just just wanted to see if I could get you some documentation on that or or something, you know explain the limitations or or anything there when migrating from on premise servers to one drive. So if I do get a call back email so
