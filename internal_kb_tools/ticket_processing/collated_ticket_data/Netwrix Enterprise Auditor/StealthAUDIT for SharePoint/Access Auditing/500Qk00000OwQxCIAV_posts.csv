Kootenai Health

3. What was the customer trying to do or accomplish when the issue happened?
Collect SPO activity

4. What is the impact of the issue on the customer's business? 
Missed activity events for long term storage might mean not having insight into certain activity later on if needed.

5. Who is affected by this issue?
Customer

6. When did the issue start?
Found it occurring on May 2 but not sure if it started then.

7. Is this the first time the customer has tried this? If not, has anything changed in their environment since the last time it worked?
First time we've seen these warnings.

8. Have any troubleshooting steps been attempted yet? If so, what have they tried?
What are the steps to reproduce the issue? If not reproducible, what are the steps the user took immediately before the issue occurred?
No extra troubleshooting steps. Its quite common unfortunately for MSFT to add new event type or change things up to where our NAA dev team needs to map those unknown event types to properly pull them into our database. This is standard procedure and really should just involve spinning up an escalation for dev to be made aware of the new event types so they can hopefully get it on a sprint to map them properly.
