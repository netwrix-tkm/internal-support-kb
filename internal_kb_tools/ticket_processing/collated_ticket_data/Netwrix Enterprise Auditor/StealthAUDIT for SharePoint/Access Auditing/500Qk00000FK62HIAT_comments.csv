"00aQk000008upb9IAA","500Qk00000FK62HIAT","Problem Statement/Business Impact:
SPAA Scans are not gracefully completing after scan finishes they hang until job timeout is met once job times out it can be bulk imported. i.e. the SPAA Scan process never terminates.

Desired Outcome:
scan should finish/terminate before bulk import should complete on it's own

Steps to Reproduce:
Run the SPAA Scan job


Client unwilling to share SPAA logs","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-09-04T20:26:37.000Z","2024-09-05T14:20:29.000Z","false","false"

Repair installation
check current version, apply latest CU
Is this happening on every run or intermittent? 
Does this happen only when run as scheduled? Does it happen if run interactively?
What other jobs are running at this time?
Table locks/deadlocks in SQL?

Without logs and ProcDump when the job hangs R&D will not be able to investigate anything.

Is this happening on every run or intermittent? yes this happens on every scheduled job we have multiple scoped scans and this happens with all of them consistently 
Does this happen only when run as scheduled? Does it happen if run interactively? we do not run interactively but i am testing this out today will update ticket with results
What other jobs are running at this time? no other jobs are running at this time this console is dedicated to SPO
Table locks/deadlocks in SQL? not seeing anything like this in logs

Without logs and ProcDump when the job hangs R&D will not be able to investigate anything. I can work on getting a proc dump that shouldnt be a problem but they are not going to share entire SPO log they are hard refusing that

@Salesforce Dev is going to investigate the dump files, could we ask the customer to set aside the job logs that correspond to the date of the dump file in case we need to get on a call to look at those?
