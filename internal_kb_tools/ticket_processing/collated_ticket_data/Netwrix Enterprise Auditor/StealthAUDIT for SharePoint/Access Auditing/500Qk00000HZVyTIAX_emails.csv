Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with us yesterday. We reviewed the SPAC errors on the call and believe them to be caused by a recent outage with MS SharePoint services. Has that scan had a chance to finish? How is it looking?

We want to bring a few of the developers back out to take a look at these new errors. Please use the link below to schedule a remote session at your convenience:

Goods news is the errors mean the scan at least got past the blocked .dll error! 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey Calvin and Mark,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us yesterday. To recap our meeting, we:


	Found a DLL error from our last HF patch on 1/30



	
	
		It looks like instructions to resolve this were sent out 1/31 but no response.
		We resolved this issue by unblocking all of the SharePoint DLLs in the PrivateAssemblies folder with the date of 01/30/2025 and then kicked off a new SPAC System Scan.
	
	



	Investigated the SP Bulk Import error (Foreign Key constraint) with development and found that the USN was much higher than the expected value. 



	
	
		A fix for this is expected from development some time next week.
	
	



Let me know how the SPAC System Scan looks when it finishes up, and I'll be in touch once I've received the patch from development (unless they have any other questions first).

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Calvin,

Our team has determined the root of the error ""Unable to perform bulk import Error: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint ""FK_SA_SPAA_Trustees_SiteCollectionId"". The conflict occurred in database ""StealthauditDB"", table ""dbo.SA_SPAA_Resources"".""

A fix is currently in the works but no delivery date is available at this time.

Thank you,

Hey Calvin,

Thank you for meeting with me this morning. To recap our session, we deployed a hotfix for the SharePoint module that should improve the index used by site collection. Gabby Davidson and I spoke with our development team earlier today and she should be sending out an update of where we are with the Foreign Key issue.

I will keep you in the loop as we continue to hear more.

Thank you,

Hello Calvin,

Our team has determined the root of the error ""Unable to perform bulk import Error: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint ""FK_SA_SPAA_Trustees_SiteCollectionId"". The conflict occurred in database ""StealthauditDB"", table ""dbo.SA_SPAA_Resources"".""

A fix is currently in the works but no delivery date is available at this time.

Thank you,

Hey Calvin,

Thank you for meeting with me this morning. To recap our session, we deployed a hotfix for the SharePoint module that should improve the index used by site collection. Gabby Davidson and I spoke with our development team earlier today and she should be sending out an update of where we are with the Foreign Key issue.

I will keep you in the loop as we continue to hear more.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Team, looks like the activity scan import ran and completed in 45 minutes 36 seconds. However the Permissions import didn’t run because we had it in the disable state due to all the errors it was getting in the past so I have now enabled all the jobs and going to just run a complete Sharepoint job to see what happens over the weekend.

Hey Calvin,

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:

  *   Unblocked and deployed auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068
  *   Reset the USN value for AmericanFidelity.Sharepoint.com on the SPAA_Hosts table
  *   Kicked off the SPAA_Bulk Import

At the end of our meeting, the bulk import was rolling along- let us know how this is looking tomorrow and we'll go from there!

Thank you,

Hey Team,

Our development team has got the fix for the Foreign Key issue and it has passed initial validation testing. We're currently just waiting on the final testing which we're optimistic will be completed early next week. I'd like to go ahead and get a meeting scheduled so we're ready as soon as we get the go ahead.

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with us yesterday. We reviewed the SPAC errors on the call and believe them to be caused by a recent outage with MS SharePoint services. Has that scan had a chance to finish? How is it looking?

Kindly,

Goods news is the errors mean the scan at least got past the blocked .dll error!

Hey Calvin and Mark,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us yesterday. To recap our meeting, we:

  1.  Found a DLL error from our last HF patch on 1/30

  1.

     *   It looks like instructions to resolve this were sent out 1/31 but no response.
     *   We resolved this issue by unblocking all of the SharePoint DLLs in the PrivateAssemblies folder with the date of 01/30/2025 and then kicked off a new SPAC System Scan.

  1.  Investigated the SP Bulk Import error (Foreign Key constraint) with development and found that the USN was much higher than the expected value.

  1.

     *   A fix for this is expected from development some time next week.

Let me know how the SPAC System Scan looks when it finishes up, and I'll be in touch once I've received the patch from development (unless they have any other questions first).

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hey Calvin,

I've attached the hot fix for today to this email. If it gets stripped due to email filters, I can try passing it through Zoom.

Thank you,

Team, looks like the activity scan import ran and completed in 45 minutes 36 seconds. However the Permissions import didn’t run because we had it in the disable state due to all the errors it was getting in the past so I have now enabled all the jobs and going to just run a complete Sharepoint job to see what happens over the weekend.

Hey Calvin,

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:

  *   Unblocked and deployed auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068
  *   Reset the USN value for AmericanFidelity.Sharepoint.com on the SPAA_Hosts table
  *   Kicked off the SPAA_Bulk Import

At the end of our meeting, the bulk import was rolling along- let us know how this is looking tomorrow and we'll go from there!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hey Team,

Our development team has got the fix for the Foreign Key issue and it has passed initial validation testing. We're currently just waiting on the final testing which we're optimistic will be completed early next week. I'd like to go ahead and get a meeting scheduled so we're ready as soon as we get the go ahead.

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with us yesterday. We reviewed the SPAC errors on the call and believe them to be caused by a recent outage with MS SharePoint services. Has that scan had a chance to finish? How is it looking?

Hey Calvin and Mark,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us yesterday. To recap our meeting, we:

  1.  Found a DLL error from our last HF patch on 1/30

  1.

     *   It looks like instructions to resolve this were sent out 1/31 but no response.
     *   We resolved this issue by unblocking all of the SharePoint DLLs in the PrivateAssemblies folder with the date of 01/30/2025 and then kicked off a new SPAC System Scan.

  1.  Investigated the SP Bulk Import error (Foreign Key constraint) with development and found that the USN was much higher than the expected value.

  1.

     *   A fix for this is expected from development some time next week.

Let me know how the SPAC System Scan looks when it finishes up, and I'll be in touch once I've received the patch from development (unless they have any other questions first).

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Calvin,

Our team has determined the root of the error ""Unable to perform bulk import Error: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint ""FK_SA_SPAA_Trustees_SiteCollectionId"". The conflict occurred in database ""StealthauditDB"", table ""dbo.SA_SPAA_Resources"".""

A fix is currently in the works but no delivery date is available at this time.

Hey Calvin,

Thank you for meeting with me this morning. To recap our session, we deployed a hotfix for the SharePoint module that should improve the index used by site collection. Gabby Davidson and I spoke with our development team earlier today and she should be sending out an update of where we are with the Foreign Key issue.

I will keep you in the loop as we continue to hear more.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

I ran the entire SharePoint job over the weekend and did complete. Both the Activity and Permissions scans ran and did bulk import data. We did get some errors on the Permissions scans; however, those may be normal or minor errors. Error enumerating Resource with the Property Name was not yet loaded and SharePoint rest service exception. It was a total of 687 lines out of millions.

Team, looks like the activity scan import ran and completed in 45 minutes 36 seconds. However the Permissions import didn’t run because we had it in the disable state due to all the errors it was getting in the past so I have now enabled all the jobs and going to just run a complete Sharepoint job to see what happens over the weekend.

Hey Calvin,

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:

  *   Unblocked and deployed auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068
  *   Reset the USN value for AmericanFidelity.Sharepoint.com on the SPAA_Hosts table
  *   Kicked off the SPAA_Bulk Import

At the end of our meeting, the bulk import was rolling along- let us know how this is looking tomorrow and we'll go from there!

Thank you,

Our development team has got the fix for the Foreign Key issue and it has passed initial validation testing. We're currently just waiting on the final testing which we're optimistic will be completed early next week. I'd like to go ahead and get a meeting scheduled so we're ready as soon as we get the go ahead.

Hey Calvin and Mark,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us yesterday. To recap our meeting, we:

  1.  Found a DLL error from our last HF patch on 1/30

  1.

     *   It looks like instructions to resolve this were sent out 1/31 but no response.
     *   We resolved this issue by unblocking all of the SharePoint DLLs in the PrivateAssemblies folder with the date of 01/30/2025 and then kicked off a new SPAC System Scan.

  1.  Investigated the SP Bulk Import error (Foreign Key constraint) with development and found that the USN was much higher than the expected value.

  1.

     *   A fix for this is expected from development some time next week.

Let me know how the SPAC System Scan looks when it finishes up, and I'll be in touch once I've received the patch from development (unless they have any other questions first).

Thank you,

Hello Calvin,

Our team has determined the root of the error ""Unable to perform bulk import Error: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint ""FK_SA_SPAA_Trustees_SiteCollectionId"". The conflict occurred in database ""StealthauditDB"", table ""dbo.SA_SPAA_Resources"".""

A fix is currently in the works but no delivery date is available at this time.

Thank you,

Hey Calvin,

Thank you for meeting with me this morning. To recap our session, we deployed a hotfix for the SharePoint module that should improve the index used by site collection. Gabby Davidson and I spoke with our development team earlier today and she should be sending out an update of where we are with the Foreign Key issue.

I will keep you in the loop as we continue to hear more.

Thank you,

I ran the entire SharePoint job over the weekend and did complete. Both the Activity and Permissions scans ran and did bulk import data. We did get some errors on the Permissions scans; however, those may be normal or minor errors. Error enumerating Resource with the Property Name was not yet loaded and SharePoint rest service exception. It was a total of 687 lines out of millions.

Team, looks like the activity scan import ran and completed in 45 minutes 36 seconds. However the Permissions import didn’t run because we had it in the disable state due to all the errors it was getting in the past so I have now enabled all the jobs and going to just run a complete Sharepoint job to see what happens over the weekend.

Hey Calvin,

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:


	Unblocked and deployed auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068
	Reset the USN value for AmericanFidelity.Sharepoint.com on the SPAA_Hosts table
	Kicked off the SPAA_Bulk Import



At the end of our meeting, the bulk import was rolling along- let us know how this is looking tomorrow and we'll go from there!

Thank you,

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with us yesterday. We reviewed the SPAC errors on the call and believe them to be caused by a recent outage with MS SharePoint services. Has that scan had a chance to finish? How is it looking?

Kindly,

Hey Calvin,

We want to bring a few of the developers back out to take a look at these new errors. Please use the link below to schedule a remote session at your convenience:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=VjdmwgAD5w0TLQWS2tT9yNd8FTeAre5DdO7U2pprE8k-Z&MeetingID=mj4TGEmi4cL.sn4qB5u1AnxDLJelZkWS9kW3xCUCg6E-Z

Goods news is the errors mean the scan at least got past the blocked .dll error! 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hey Calvin and Mark,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us yesterday. To recap our meeting, we:


	Found a DLL error from our last HF patch on 1/30



	 



	
	
		It looks like instructions to resolve this were sent out 1/31 but no response.
		We resolved this issue by unblocking all of the SharePoint DLLs in the PrivateAssemblies folder with the date of 01/30/2025 and then kicked off a new SPAC System Scan.
	
	



	Investigated the SP Bulk Import error (Foreign Key constraint) with development and found that the USN was much higher than the expected value. 



	 



	
	
		A fix for this is expected from development some time next week.
	
	



Let me know how the SPAC System Scan looks when it finishes up, and I'll be in touch once I've received the patch from development (unless they have any other questions first).

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Calvin,

Our team has determined the root of the error ""Unable to perform bulk import Error: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint ""FK_SA_SPAA_Trustees_SiteCollectionId"". The conflict occurred in database ""StealthauditDB"", table ""dbo.SA_SPAA_Resources"".""

A fix is currently in the works but no delivery date is available at this time.

Thank you,

Hey Calvin,

Thank you for meeting with me this morning. To recap our session, we deployed a hotfix for the SharePoint module that should improve the index used by site collection. Gabby Davidson and I spoke with our development team earlier today and she should be sending out an update of where we are with the Foreign Key issue.

I will keep you in the loop as we continue to hear more.

Thank you,

SPAC is definitely looking good! From what I'm seeing, those few warnings aren't inhibiting data collection, looks to be referencing a new event type SharePoint added by MS recently. I'll get a separate ticket spun up for dev to get that event added.

When you have a chance, can you also upload the logs for SPAA System Scan and Bulk Import? I believe that was the job with our main hold up regarding the key constraint issue.

Thank you,

Hey Calvin,

SPAC is definitely looking good! From what I'm seeing, those few warnings aren't inhibiting data collection, looks to be referencing a new event type SharePoint added by MS recently. I'll get a separate ticket spun up for dev to get that event added.

When you have a chance, can you also upload the logs for SPAA System Scan and Bulk Import? I believe that was the job with our main hold up regarding the key constraint issue.

Thank you,

Looks like a few days ago I reached out to gather the latest logs from the SPAA System Scan and SPAA Bulk Import to take a look at the errors and see if there was anything else we can clean up for you. When you have a chance, can you upload those to the ticket via the customer portal so I can take a look?

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we reviewed the SPAA System Scan and Bulk Import and are no longer being held up by Bulk Import foreign key constraint issue! It looks like our upgrade to NEA v11.6.0.138 resolved that issue for us. We also took a peak at the SPAC System scan and spun off a new ticket to get the FileTranscriptContentEdited event type added to our sharepoint activity mappings (ticket #00440262).

Karolis will also reach out with some additional resources to get a full Netwrix Health Check commissioned.

I'll proceed with closing this ticket out, but please do not hesitate to reach out here and reopen the ticket if the bulk import error returns.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,
