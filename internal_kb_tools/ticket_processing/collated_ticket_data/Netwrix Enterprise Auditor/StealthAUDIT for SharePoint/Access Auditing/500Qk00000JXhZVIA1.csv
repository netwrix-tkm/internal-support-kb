We are scanning one host.
The below error has been occurred :
“Could not allocate space for object '<a href='https://dbo.SORT' target='_blank'>dbo.SORT</a> temporary run storage:  142084767088640' in database 'tempdb' because the 'PRIMARY' filegroup is full due to lack of storage space or database files reaching the maximum allowed size. Note that UNLIMITED files are still limited to 16TB. Create the necessary space by dropping objects in the filegroup, adding additional files to the filegroup, or setting autogrowth on for existing files in the filegroup.
The transaction log for database 'tempdb' is full due to 'ACTIVE_TRANSACTION'.”
Our server config shows we are in alignment with the vendor recommendations are attached in the attachment.
We have reached out to DBA but please advise why tempDB is filling up despite the server config mentioned in the attachment.","","","","Issue resolved on it's own - most likely cause was multiple jobs running and filling the sql tempdb","Root Cause Unknown","Tay Caliguiri","Error","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for SharePoint","Access Auditing","","","9.2","Closed - Resolved","Allstate Insurance Company","Stealth Audit","2024-12-16T11:20:19.000Z","2024-12-25T16:34:14.000Z"
