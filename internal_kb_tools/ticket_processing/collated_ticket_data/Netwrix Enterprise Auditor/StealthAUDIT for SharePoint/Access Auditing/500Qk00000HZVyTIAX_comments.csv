@Salesforce @Helen Randall - that was the original topic of this escalation. However, on 11/26 support asked us to take a look at the ""EmailFromCustomer"" doc which detailed a performance issue they were having with the Adding activity Resources step of the SPAA scan. We looked into that and found that it was the same issue we were already investigating for another customer, so we linked the cases on our side. We now have a fix to the SPAC Activity Resource Manager (which includes new indexes) that will resolve that issue they spelled out in the ""EmailFromCustomer"" doc. 


Since that separate issue was raised for this customer as part of this ticket, and we now have a HF for it, we provided that HF on thursday and mentioned that the Dev team is actively investigating the FK issue, which is still the case. That's on the current sprint being actively investigated.

@Salesforce It's safe to let the customer know that the developer has been able to reproduce the issue but is still working on determining the root cause. Then we can get it into a hotfix for the customer.
