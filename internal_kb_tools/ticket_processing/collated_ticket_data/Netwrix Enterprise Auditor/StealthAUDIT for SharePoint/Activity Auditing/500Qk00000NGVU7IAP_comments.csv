@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer Feedback from Dev:
There are records with incorrect values in the URL column of the ActivitySiteCollections Tier2 table in SPAC.db3.
Please confirm this by executing the following query on SPAC.db3 database,

SELECT * FROM ActivitySiteCollections WHERE URL IS NULL
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM ActivitySiteCollections WHERE URL NOT LIKE
'https%' AND URL NOT LIKE '/%'
(See sharepoint ""From Dev > dbquery.png"" for additional visual)
Also, please get us the SPAC.db3 Tier2 database and the Activity data files scanned by NAM.

@Salesforce Update Per Dev :
The invalid URLs in the SPAC tier2 db came from SPAA db during the data migration. This migration happens whenever SPAC version is upgraded from versions lower than 10602.
Currently working on a script to quickly fix the data with minimum impact.

@Muhammad Kamran Siddique @Chris Brooks @Helen Randall @Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer

From Dev:
Please execute the following query on the SPAA SQLite db,

SELECT ID, RelativePath as URL FROM Resources WHERE Type = 2 AND URL LIKE '/%;
--- CODE ---

If any URL in the result set starts with ""/"" instead of ""https://"",  

There will be a chance of an error.


The reason mentioned in previous comments, i.e., invalid URLs from the SPAA db, is only one possible source. This can also happen during the Activity scans. 

The permanent fix will ensure that the URLs are absolute before they are saved in the database.

@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer @Muhammad Kamran Siddique

From Dev:

A quick fix for this customer,

Please take a backup of the SPAC db and execute the following queries on this same db and save the changes,



UPDATE ActivitySiteCollections SET URL = CONCAT('https://medpace-my.sharepoint.com/personal/' , SUBSTR(URL,11,INSTR(SUBSTR(URL,11,LENGTH(URL)),'/')-1)) WHERE URL LIKE '/personal/%';

UPDATE ActivitySiteCollections SET URL = CONCAT('https://medpace.sharepoint.com/sites/' , SUBSTR(URL,8,INSTR(SUBSTR(URL,8,LENGTH(URL)),'/')-1)) WHERE URL LIKE '/sites/%';

UPDATE ActivitySiteCollections SET URL = CONCAT('https://medpace.sharepoint.com/teams/' , SUBSTR(URL,8,INSTR(SUBSTR(URL,8,LENGTH(URL)),'/')-1)) WHERE URL LIKE '/teams/%';--- CODE ---


The above script will append the base URLs to the problematic URIs to fix the problem.

Then execute the following query on the same SPAA db,


SELECT * FROM ActivitySiteCollections WHERE URL NOT LIKE 'http%';
--- CODE ---

Please execute the SPAC System Scan job that was previously failing if the above query returns 0 records.

Execute the queries from the previous comment on the SPAC db and save the changes.

Then, execute the SELECT query from the previous comment on the SPAC db. If it returns any result, let us know. 

Otherwise, please run the Activity scans and import.

Do not run any query on the SPAA db.
