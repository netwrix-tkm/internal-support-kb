SPAC scan log and latest applied SharePoint mappings included in the ""FOR_R&D"" folder. Please advise if we'd like to keep this under the existing escalation or open a new one based on these mappings not being included in original escalation issue. Thanks!

@Salesforce@Ethan Israel@Helen Randall Hi Kurt,
I've included the events you've mentioned with the additional ones I've found in a new ticket. I would recommend closing this one and opening a new ticket if you would like to track an item specifically for the customer I can link to the mentioned ""361791"" and we will get these added to the mapping.xml in the future.
Thanks!
