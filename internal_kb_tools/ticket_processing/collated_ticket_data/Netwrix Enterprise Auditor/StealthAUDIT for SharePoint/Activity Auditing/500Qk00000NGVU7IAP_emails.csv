The Bulk Import succeeded but the Activity table only resolved the “SA_SPAC_ActivityTrusteePrincipalIDs” table. I did run the SystemScans job and it errored as usual.

The Bulk Import succeeded but the Activity table only resolved the “SA_SPAC_ActivityTrusteePrincipalIDs” table. I did run the SystemScans job and it errored as usual.

It’s still progressing from the looks of it and made decent progress of almost 2 months worth of activity in 15 hours.

Hey Brittany,

Looks like we missed a button that writes the sqlite db changes. I'll include the steps below, please let me know if you want to hop on a call to complete this together:


	Open the SPAC.db3 database with DB Browser for SQLite
	Run code #1 below
	Run code #2 below
	Write Changes (this is what we missed yesterday) 
	Rerun the SPAC System Scan and Bulk Import and let me know how that looks.



---CODE #1 ---
UPDATE ActivitySiteCollections SET URL = CONCAT('https://medpace-my.sharepoint.com/personal/' , SUBSTR(URL,11,INSTR(SUBSTR(URL,11,LENGTH(URL)),'/')-1)) WHERE URL LIKE '/personal/%';

UPDATE ActivitySiteCollections SET URL = CONCAT('https://medpace.sharepoint.com/sites/' , SUBSTR(URL,8,INSTR(SUBSTR(URL,8,LENGTH(URL)),'/')-1)) WHERE URL LIKE '/sites/%';

UPDATE ActivitySiteCollections SET URL = CONCAT('https://medpace.sharepoint.com/teams/' , SUBSTR(URL,8,INSTR(SUBSTR(URL,8,LENGTH(URL)),'/')-1)) WHERE URL LIKE '/teams/%';
---CODE #1---

---CODE #2---
SELECT * FROM ActivitySiteCollections WHERE URL NOT LIKE 'http%';
---CODE #2---
