Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

I understand you're running into an issue with your SharePoint Online activity scans are unable to find the ini file path.

Has the SharePoint Online tenant been configured in Netwrix Activity Monitor > Monitored Hosts?


If it's not there, please use the below article to assist you with setting up SPO Activity auditing for that tenant:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/ActivityMonitor_7.1/page/Content/Config/SharePointOnline/Activity.htm


If you do have the tenant there, please use the link below so we can get a troubleshooting session scheduled:
