This will our ticket moving forward with getting the new ""FileTranscriptContentEdited"" event type for SharePoint Online added to our activity mappings. I've sent the SPAC System log from the previous case over to dev so they can get started on that. At this time, no action is required from you guys, but I'll keep you in the loop as things progress.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or find anymore new ""Unknown Event Types""!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri
