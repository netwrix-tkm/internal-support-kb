After we've reviewed this. We decided that having T2s would help solve this issue, is that something the customer can provide?
Thank you!

@Salesforce @Helen Randall - just to update from out of band discussion in teams:

We often see issues like this when a customer has run a SPAC scan which collected activity against SP resources that have not yet been scanned with SPAA/SPSEEK. If they're looking at this activity in the AIC right after running SPAC scan and import that may explain why the ResourceIds are null. Running an SPAA or SPSEEK scan with those resources in scope then importing would resolve the issue in that case.

After reviewing the SQLite databases provided, it looks like there are resources picked up by the activity scan that were not picked up by the permission scan. Are the resources expected to be seen in activity views showing up in permissions views? Can we get the names of a few resources that are expected to showing up in the activity views?

In the tier 2 databases provided I do see activity events for PCB-CORP-ITGC-ITGC-IAM and its children. I am going though the tier 2 databases further to determine why activity within teams channels are missing.

I reviewed the SQLite databases, specifically looking for activity events for PCB-CORP-ITGC-ITGC-SOX Artifacts and PCB-CORP-ITGC-ITGC-IAM. I found no activity events for PCB-CORP-ITGC-ITGC-SOX Artifacts, and three activity events for PCB-CORP-ITGC-ITGC-IAM. Please verify that activity events with IDs 3992693, 8400059, and 12642013 are in SA_SPAC_ActivityEventsView. 


There is nothing out of the ordinary with the SQLite databases, but there are quite a few resources collected by the activity scan that were not collected by the permission scan, which would result in resources not showing up in the AIC. Make sure that resources with activity events you are looking for are in scope of the permission scan.
