NEA does not have the most up to date SP Event XML to resolve new event IDs which produces the error.","In SPAC log we see:
[C:53] No log location set in configuration for host and no default log location specified, will get log locations from registry","Make sure the SPAC job is properly configured to find the activity logs for SPO","The warnings regarding missing/unknown event ID are corrected with NEA v11.6. They are newer event types being collected by Activity Monitor that SA v11.5 does not have the mapping for, but they are not inhibiting the data collection.

The main issue that we were running into previous was the Activity Logs portion of the query settings was not properly configured.
