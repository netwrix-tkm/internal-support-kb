After reviewing the SQLite databases you provided, we noticed that some resources appear in the activity scan but not in the permission scan. Are the resources you expect to see in the activity views also showing up in the permissions views? If possible, could you share the names of a few resources that you expect to see in the activity views?

Thank you,
