If they are reviewing this activity in the AIC immediately after importing the SPAC scan data, it could explain why the ResourceIds are null. Running an SPAA or SPSEEK scan with those resources included and then importing the results should resolve the issue.

Let me know if you continue to se the NULLs after running SPAA/SPSEEK.

""I opened this case after multiple SPAA/SPEEK runs, this is still a problem.""","","","","0050g000006QqyEAAS","2025-01-28T19:05:37.000Z"
