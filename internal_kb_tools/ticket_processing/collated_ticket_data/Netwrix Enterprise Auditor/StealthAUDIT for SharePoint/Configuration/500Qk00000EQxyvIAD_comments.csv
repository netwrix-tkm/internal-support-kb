"00aQk000008byQPIAY","500Qk00000EQxyvIAD","We performed that pre-flight process in preparation for the official upgrade of the NEA platform from 11.5 to the latest 11.6 version. This will include the NEA platform, the Published Reports web console, and the Access Information Center web console.

Additionally, we discovered that the SPAA system scan job was failing due to possible insufficient permissions. This was identified within the console under the connect status node of the job as well as the SPAA system scan logs. I recommended verifying and applying the required permissions in the documentation below and rerunning the SPAA scan. I have also provided the location in which these permissions should be applied to the account as well. 
 
Step 1 – Select the newly created, registered application. If you leave the Overview page, it will be listed in the Identity > Applications > App registrations > All applications list.

Step 2 – On the registered app blade, click API permissions in the Manage section.

Step 3 – In the top toolbar, click Add a permission.

Step 4 – On the Request API permissions blade, select Microsoft Graph on the Microsoft APIs tab.

Will created a separate ticket for the upgrade.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-08-19T17:10:54.000Z","2024-08-19T17:10:54.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000008tezVIAQ","500Qk00000EQxyvIAD","We attempted to run the SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job again but were met with errors when PowerShell attempted to call the Connect-Azure AD cmd. We then successfully installed the Azrue AD module for PowerShell as well as the Microsoft.Graph module.

This resolved the warning that PowerShell prompted. We then attempted to run the Connect-Azure AD cmd and was prompted with a different error message regarding the inability to authenticate because the proxy or server was not found.

We suggested performing the Azure App Auth registration manually on the Azure portal side. I have provided helpful documentation of this process below:
