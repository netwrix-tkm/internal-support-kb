Hey Dusty –

Thanks again for reply. On the documentation page from email below, it mentions

“A credential with the username newapp that contains the password for the new application”

Password for new application? Is this something I just make up and the job will use that?

How should I have known to install that instant job? I had gone through manually granted the application and delegated permissions per directions here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/SharePoint.htm


Is this instant job doing the same thing?

Thanks in advance,

Hey Dusty –

Thanks again for reply. On the documentation page from email below, it mentions

“A credential with the username newapp that contains the password for the new application”

Password for new application? Is this something I just make up and the job will use that?

How should I have known to install that instant job? I had gone through manually granted the application and delegated permissions per directions here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/SharePoint.htm


Is this instant job doing the same thing?

Thanks in advance,

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.

Correct on the newapp pwd this would need to be noted somewhere internal for later reference.

Being that this is the Recommended way to set up new Azure (Entra) apps It should have been listed in the SPO guide section you noted, I have submitted feed back to the Doc team to address this.

There are also similar jobs for EXO and AzureAD/Entra ID (Entra ID Inventory) Requirements, Permissions, and Ports should reference the AADI_RegisterAzureAppAuth which is currently not documented in the 11.6 guide being that this job is the recommended method to setup/update the needed Azure App registration, Feedback as again been submitted.

For Exchange Online Auditing Configuration does note the recommend EX_RegisterAzureAppAuth to setup the needed App Registration.

Please let me know if you have issues with these jobs to be able to setup the needed Azure App registrations or the scans following.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hey Dusty –

Note: I’m wondering  if a call might help? Asking because this is time consuming to provide these sorts of emails and feel like the in a fraction of the time I’m preparing what I hope is a complete description of my current experience, it would be working.

I made an assumption that “edit” was really Properties (in the Tasks area), then click Configure, then click Parameters, then click $appName, then click Edit as shown below.  Was this a correct assumption?

Ran the job and under Status it shows….

Connect Status (encouraging)
[cid:image005.png@01DAD371.AE539790]

Job Stats (interesting but would help to have some kind of status indicator even if just “expected”)
[cid:image006.png@01DAD373.261D11B0]

Task Stats (something went wrong)
[cid:image007.png@01DAD373.4A263A50]

Hey Dusty –

Thanks again for reply. On the documentation page from email below, it mentions

“A credential with the username newapp that contains the password for the new application”

Password for new application? Is this something I just make up and the job will use that?

How should I have known to install that instant job? I had gone through manually granted the application and delegated permissions per directions here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/SharePoint.htm


Is this instant job doing the same thing?

Thanks in advance,

bill

Hey Dusty –

Great email.

It is emails like this that make me want to partner with Netwrix and yes, per my immediately previous email to this one, I am having issues with the App Reg job for SharePoint. Nice idea, more turn key, it just needs more clear directions. A video link would be awesome.



Thanks in advance,

Bill,

Correct on the newapp pwd this would need to be noted somewhere internal for later reference.

Being that this is the Recommended way to set up new Azure (Entra) apps It should have been listed in the SPO guide section you noted, I have submitted feed back to the Doc team to address this.

There are also similar jobs for EXO and AzureAD/Entra ID (Entra ID Inventory) Requirements, Permissions, and Ports should reference the AADI_RegisterAzureAppAuth which is currently not documented in the 11.6 guide being that this job is the recommended method to setup/update the needed Azure App registration, Feedback as again been submitted.

For Exchange Online Auditing Configuration does note the recommend EX_RegisterAzureAppAuth to setup the needed App Registration.

Please let me know if you have issues with these jobs to be able to setup the needed Azure App registrations or the scans following.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hey Dusty –

I decided it wouldn’t hurt to change the $appName parameter to “newapp” without quotes and it appeared to work. A browser window did open and it is the first one shown below on the left – I waited quite some time but it never showed so I refreshed and still nothing. So, I went to the second shot as shown on the right and Admin consent was already granted for all applications.

I’m following the remainder of the directions.

Hey Dusty –

Note: I’m wondering  if a call might help? Asking because this is time consuming to provide these sorts of emails and feel like the in a fraction of the time I’m preparing what I hope is a complete description of my current experience, it would be working.

I made an assumption that “edit” was really Properties (in the Tasks area), then click Configure, then click Parameters, then click $appName, then click Edit as shown below.  Was this a correct assumption?

Ran the job and under Status it shows….

Connect Status (encouraging)
[cid:image005.png@01DAD371.AE539790]

Job Stats (interesting but would help to have some kind of status indicator even if just “expected”)
[cid:image006.png@01DAD373.261D11B0]

Task Stats (something went wrong)
[cid:image007.png@01DAD373.4A263A50]

Messages (I followed directions or tried to and feel like I missed something…)

Hey Dusty –

Thanks again for reply. On the documentation page from email below, it mentions

“A credential with the username newapp that contains the password for the new application”

Password for new application? Is this something I just make up and the job will use that?

How should I have known to install that instant job? I had gone through manually granted the application and delegated permissions per directions here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/SharePoint.htm


Is this instant job doing the same thing?

Thanks in advance,

Hey Dusty –

I’m thinking this should say “key” where it says password. Assuming I’m correct, it can get confusing as there is a password as part of the key.

Should it be key for the green boxes below?

Hey Dusty –

I decided it wouldn’t hurt to change the $appName parameter to “newapp” without quotes and it appeared to work. A browser window did open and it is the first one shown below on the left – I waited quite some time but it never showed so I refreshed and still nothing. So, I went to the second shot as shown on the right and Admin consent was already granted for all applications.

I’m following the remainder of the directions.

Hey Dusty –

Assuming I’m on the right track (hard to say), I ran the job for SharePoint after editing the key (aka password) and assigning the newly created Connection at the folder level for “0. Collection”.

Whew…there’s a lot that can go wrong. I’m trying and sorry if I appear obtuse – I’m very literal certainly.

Any thoughts on this one?

Hey Dusty –

I’m thinking this should say “key” where it says password. Assuming I’m correct, it can get confusing as there is a password as part of the key.

Should it be key for the green boxes below?

Hey Dusty –

I decided it wouldn’t hurt to change the $appName parameter to “newapp” without quotes and it appeared to work. A browser window did open and it is the first one shown below on the left – I waited quite some time but it never showed so I refreshed and still nothing. So, I went to the second shot as shown on the right and Admin consent was already granted for all applications.

I’m following the remainder of the directions.

Hey Dusty –

Note: I’m wondering  if a call might help? Asking because this is time consuming to provide these sorts of emails and feel like the in a fraction of the time I’m preparing what I hope is a complete description of my current experience, it would be working.

I made an assumption that “edit” was really Properties (in the Tasks area), then click Configure, then click Parameters, then click $appName, then click Edit as shown below.  Was this a correct assumption?

Ran the job and under Status it shows….

Connect Status (encouraging)
[cid:image005.png@01DAD371.AE539790]

Job Stats (interesting but would help to have some kind of status indicator even if just “expected”)
[cid:image006.png@01DAD373.261D11B0]

Task Stats (something went wrong)
[cid:image007.png@01DAD373.4A263A50]

Messages (I followed directions or tried to and feel like I missed something…)

Hey Dusty –

Thanks again for reply. On the documentation page from email below, it mentions

“A credential with the username newapp that contains the password for the new application”

Password for new application? Is this something I just make up and the job will use that?

How should I have known to install that instant job? I had gone through manually granted the application and delegated permissions per directions here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/SharePoint.htm


Is this instant job doing the same thing?

Thanks in advance,

bill

Bill,

Thank You for the update.

Take a look at the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor V11.6 > Administration > Jobs Tree > Instant Job Wizard > SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth.htm

This is the recommend method to setting up the SPO connection profile.

Bill,

Thank you for reaching out to support.

Is this for Novacoast internally or one of your customers? If one of your customers please identify so we can correctly update the ticket

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR

Is this for SharePoint On Prem or Online?

Could we get an Export of the Job in question for review?
Example:
[cid:fbd68fb5-3e9f-491f-ae4c-781f8b76b74e@Image_3_]   [cid:5c87d9a4-adc1-45e0-85c4-e8ebfd09d0cb@Image_4_]

Looking at this a little closer, “[C:32] Forms authentication to http endpoints disabled.  Enable [UseFormsAuthenticationWithoutSsl] setting to connect despite the security risk.”

Will this or has it already transmitted connection data as clear text?

Hey Dusty –

Note: I’m wondering  if a call might help? Asking because this is time consuming to provide these sorts of emails and feel like the in a fraction of the time I’m preparing what I hope is a complete description of my current experience, it would be working.

I made an assumption that “edit” was really Properties (in the Tasks area), then click Configure, then click Parameters, then click $appName, then click Edit as shown below.  Was this a correct assumption?

Bill,

Thank you for reaching out to support.

Is this for Novacoast internally or one of your customers? If one of your customers please identify so we can correctly update the ticket

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR

Is this for SharePoint On Prem or Online?

Could we get an Export of the Job in question for review?
Example:
[cid:fbd68fb5-3e9f-491f-ae4c-781f8b76b74e@Image_3_]   [cid:5c87d9a4-adc1-45e0-85c4-e8ebfd09d0cb@Image_4_]

The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.
https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=my_tickets.html

Once the upload has completed reply to this email, so I know to pull the files.

Hey Dusty –

Looking at this a little closer, “[C:32] Forms authentication to http endpoints disabled.  Enable [UseFormsAuthenticationWithoutSsl] setting to connect despite the security risk.”

Will this or has it already transmitted connection data as clear text?

Hey Dusty –

Assuming I’m on the right track (hard to say), I ran the job for SharePoint after editing the key (aka password) and assigning the newly created Connection at the folder level for “0. Collection”.

Whew…there’s a lot that can go wrong. I’m trying and sorry if I appear obtuse – I’m very literal certainly.

Any thoughts on this one?

Hey Dusty –

I’m thinking this should say “key” where it says password. Assuming I’m correct, it can get confusing as there is a password as part of the key.

Should it be key for the green boxes below?

Hey Dusty –

I decided it wouldn’t hurt to change the $appName parameter to “newapp” without quotes and it appeared to work. A browser window did open and it is the first one shown below on the left – I waited quite some time but it never showed so I refreshed and still nothing. So, I went to the second shot as shown on the right and Admin consent was already granted for all applications.

I’m following the remainder of the directions.

Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR

Is this for SharePoint On Prem or Online?

Could we get an Export of the Job in question for review?

Hello again –

 

This page:  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/administration/configure-basic-authentication-for-a-claims-based-web-application, assuming I understand correctly, indicates configuring is only supported for the on the on premise versions?

Hey Dusty –

 

Looking at this a little closer, “[C:32] Forms authentication to http endpoints disabled.  Enable [UseFormsAuthenticationWithoutSsl] setting to connect despite the security risk.”

 

Will this or has it already transmitted connection data as clear text?


 

 

Thanks in advance,

Hey Dusty –

 

Assuming I’m on the right track (hard to say), I ran the job for SharePoint after editing the key (aka password) and assigning the newly created Connection at the folder level for “0. Collection”.

 

Whew…there’s a lot that can go wrong. I’m trying and sorry if I appear obtuse – I’m very literal certainly.

 

Any thoughts on this one?

 



 


 

 

Thanks in advance,


bill

Hey Dusty –

 

I’m thinking this should say “key” where it says password. Assuming I’m correct, it can get confusing as there is a password as part of the key.

 

Should it be key for the green boxes below?

Hey Dusty –

 

I decided it wouldn’t hurt to change the $appName parameter to “newapp” without quotes and it appeared to work. A browser window did open and it is the first one shown below on the left – I waited quite some time but it never showed so I refreshed and still nothing. So, I went to the second shot as shown on the right and Admin consent was already granted for all applications.

 

I’m following the remainder of the directions.

Hey Dusty –

 

Note: I’m wondering  if a call might help? Asking because this is time consuming to provide these sorts of emails and feel like the in a fraction of the time I’m preparing what I hope is a complete description of my current experience, it would be working.

 

I made an assumption that “edit” was really Properties (in the Tasks area), then click Configure, then click Parameters, then click $appName, then click Edit as shown below.  Was this a correct assumption?

 

Ran the job and under Status it shows….

 

Connect Status (encouraging)



 

Job Stats (interesting but would help to have some kind of status indicator even if just “expected”)



 

Task Stats (something went wrong)



 

Messages (I followed directions or tried to and feel like I missed something…)

Hey Dusty –

 

Thanks again for reply. On the documentation page from email below, it mentions

 

“A credential with the username newapp that contains the password for the new application”

 


Password for new application? Is this something I just make up and the job will use that?

 

How should I have known to install that instant job? I had gone through manually granted the application and delegated permissions per directions here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/SharePoint.htm

 

 

Is this instant job doing the same thing?

 

Thanks in advance,


bill

Hey Dusty –

Good news, you can close this case. Here’s what learned.


  1.  Contrary to documentation, the host should have been “M365X41559705.SHAREPOINT.COM” versus “M365X41559705.ONMICROSOFT.COM”. This might have been the sole cause of the issue.

  2.  The version of NEA I was running was Netwrix Enterprise Auditor V11.6, version 11.6.0.72 which I had installed on May 10th, 2024. I downloaded and installed the latest version of all the NIC as well.

  3.  The documentation indicates a new browser window will open, looks like 3 windows opened but one was completely blank.

  4.  Despite this, the collection job folder shows error icons on three of the jobs. One because it can’t find an INI file because of on premise remnants being used for the SharePoint online process. Two others because of WARNINGS which show as errors.

Thanks for your assistance on this issue as the tip to use the instant jobs which do setup for solutions was extremely helpful.


Thanks in advance,

bill

Hey Dusty –

Looking at this a little closer, “[C:32] Forms authentication to http endpoints disabled.  Enable [UseFormsAuthenticationWithoutSsl] setting to connect despite the security risk.”

Will this or has it already transmitted connection data as clear text?

Hey Dusty –

Assuming I’m on the right track (hard to say), I ran the job for SharePoint after editing the key (aka password) and assigning the newly created Connection at the folder level for “0. Collection”.

Whew…there’s a lot that can go wrong. I’m trying and sorry if I appear obtuse – I’m very literal certainly.

Any thoughts on this one?

Hey Dusty –

I’m thinking this should say “key” where it says password. Assuming I’m correct, it can get confusing as there is a password as part of the key.

Should it be key for the green boxes below?

Hey Dusty –

I decided it wouldn’t hurt to change the $appName parameter to “newapp” without quotes and it appeared to work. A browser window did open and it is the first one shown below on the left – I waited quite some time but it never showed so I refreshed and still nothing. So, I went to the second shot as shown on the right and Admin consent was already granted for all applications.

I’m following the remainder of the directions.

Hey Dusty –

Note: I’m wondering  if a call might help? Asking because this is time consuming to provide these sorts of emails and feel like the in a fraction of the time I’m preparing what I hope is a complete description of my current experience, it would be working.

I made an assumption that “edit” was really Properties (in the Tasks area), then click Configure, then click Parameters, then click $appName, then click Edit as shown below.  Was this a correct assumption?

Ran the job and under Status it shows….

Connect Status (encouraging)
[cid:d4f08f5c-9bc4-49d7-926a-286d2d08f286@Image_16_]

Job Stats (interesting but would help to have some kind of status indicator even if just “expected”)
[cid:527bc453-a50f-4569-8595-9edfbf5d49c8@Image_17_]

Task Stats (something went wrong)

Hey Dusty –

Thanks again for reply. On the documentation page from email below, it mentions

“A credential with the username newapp that contains the password for the new application”

Password for new application? Is this something I just make up and the job will use that?

How should I have known to install that instant job? I had gone through manually granted the application and delegated permissions per directions here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/SharePoint.htm


Is this instant job doing the same thing?

Thanks in advance,

Bill,

Thank you for reaching out to support.

Is this for Novacoast internally or one of your customers? If one of your customers please identify so we can correctly update the ticket

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR

Is this for SharePoint On Prem or Online?

Could we get an Export of the Job in question for review?
Example:
[cid:69ccb352-6364-4d8c-8aa9-9a868f9048f3@Image_31_]   [cid:f58b499d-c897-4155-a7c9-4429b0937e48@Image_32_]

Hey Dusty –

 

Good news, you can close this case. Here’s what learned.

 


	Contrary to documentation, the host should have been “M365X41559705.SHAREPOINT.COM” versus “M365X41559705.ONMICROSOFT.COM”. This might have been the sole cause of the issue.
	 
	The version of NEA I was running was Netwrix Enterprise Auditor V11.6, version 11.6.0.72 which I had installed on May 10th, 2024. I downloaded and installed the latest version of all the NIC as well.
	 
	The documentation indicates a new browser window will open, looks like 3 windows opened but one was completely blank.
	 
	Despite this, the collection job folder shows error icons on three of the jobs. One because it can’t find an INI file because of on premise remnants being used for the SharePoint online process. Two others because of WARNINGS which show as errors.
	 


Thanks for your assistance on this issue as the tip to use the instant jobs which do setup for solutions was extremely helpful.


 

 

Thanks in advance,


bill

Hello again –

 

This page: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/administration/configure-basic-authentication-for-a-claims-based-web-application, assuming I understand correctly, indicates configuring is only supported for the on the on premise versions?

Hey Dusty –

 

Looking at this a little closer, “[C:32] Forms authentication to http endpoints disabled.  Enable [UseFormsAuthenticationWithoutSsl] setting to connect despite the security risk.”

 

Will this or has it already transmitted connection data as clear text?

Hey Dusty –

 

Assuming I’m on the right track (hard to say), I ran the job for SharePoint after editing the key (aka password) and assigning the newly created Connection at the folder level for “0. Collection”.

 

Whew…there’s a lot that can go wrong. I’m trying and sorry if I appear obtuse – I’m very literal certainly.

 

Any thoughts on this one?

Hey Dusty –

 

I’m thinking this should say “key” where it says password. Assuming I’m correct, it can get confusing as there is a password as part of the key.

 

Should it be key for the green boxes below?

Hey Dusty –

 

I decided it wouldn’t hurt to change the $appName parameter to “newapp” without quotes and it appeared to work. A browser window did open and it is the first one shown below on the left – I waited quite some time but it never showed so I refreshed and still nothing. So, I went to the second shot as shown on the right and Admin consent was already granted for all applications.

 

I’m following the remainder of the directions.

Hey Dusty –

 

Note: I’m wondering  if a call might help? Asking because this is time consuming to provide these sorts of emails and feel like the in a fraction of the time I’m preparing what I hope is a complete description of my current experience, it would be working.

 

I made an assumption that “edit” was really Properties (in the Tasks area), then click Configure, then click Parameters, then click $appName, then click Edit as shown below.  Was this a correct assumption?

 

Ran the job and under Status it shows….

 

Connect Status (encouraging)



 

Job Stats (interesting but would help to have some kind of status indicator even if just “expected”)



 

Task Stats (something went wrong)



 

Messages (I followed directions or tried to and feel like I missed something…)

 



 



 


 

 

Thanks in advance,

Bill,

Correct on the newapp pwd this would need to be noted somewhere internal for later reference.

Being that this is the Recommended way to set up new Azure (Entra) apps It should have been listed in the SPO guide section you noted, I have submitted feed back to the Doc team to address this.

There are also similar jobs for EXO and AzureAD/Entra ID (Entra ID Inventory) Requirements, Permissions, and Ports should reference the AADI_RegisterAzureAppAuth which is currently not documented in the 11.6 guide being that this job is the recommended method to setup/update the needed Azure App registration, Feedback as again been submitted.

For Exchange Online Auditing Configuration does note the recommend EX_RegisterAzureAppAuth to setup the needed App Registration.

Please let me know if you have issues with these jobs to be able to setup the needed Azure App registrations or the scans following.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hey Dusty –

 

Thanks again for reply. On the documentation page from email below, it mentions

 

“A credential with the username newapp that contains the password for the new application”

 


Password for new application? Is this something I just make up and the job will use that?

 

How should I have known to install that instant job? I had gone through manually granted the application and delegated permissions per directions here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/SharePoint.htm

 

 

Is this instant job doing the same thing?

 

Thanks in advance,


bill

Bill,

Thank You for the update.

Take a look at the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor V11.6 > Administration > Jobs Tree > Instant Job Wizard > SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth Job
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/SP_RegisterAzureAppAuth.htm

This is the recommend method to setting up the SPO connection profile.

Hello Dusty –

 

Thanks for quick response!

 

This is for my enablement or Novacoast internal so I can talk with customers about better.

Bill,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 

Is this for Novacoast internally or one of your customers? If one of your customers please identify so we can correctly update the ticket

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

Is this for SharePoint On Prem or Online?

Could we get an Export of the Job in question for review?
Example:
   

The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.
https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=my_tickets.html

Once the upload has completed reply to this email, so I know to pull the files.

Thank You for your time.

Hey Dusty –

Good news, you can close this case. Here’s what learned.


  1.  Contrary to documentation, the host should have been “M365X41559705.SHAREPOINT.COM” versus “M365X41559705.ONMICROSOFT.COM”. This might have been the sole cause of the issue.

  2.  The version of NEA I was running was Netwrix Enterprise Auditor V11.6, version 11.6.0.72 which I had installed on May 10th, 2024. I downloaded and installed the latest version of all the NIC as well.

  3.  The documentation indicates a new browser window will open, looks like 3 windows opened but one was completely blank.

  4.  Despite this, the collection job folder shows error icons on three of the jobs. One because it can’t find an INI file because of on premise remnants being used for the SharePoint online process. Two others because of WARNINGS which show as errors.

Thanks for your assistance on this issue as the tip to use the instant jobs which do setup for solutions was extremely helpful.


Thanks in advance,

bill

This page: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/administration/configure-basic-authentication-for-a-claims-based-web-application, assuming I understand correctly, indicates configuring is only supported for the on the on premise versions?

Hey Dusty –

Looking at this a little closer, “[C:32] Forms authentication to http endpoints disabled.  Enable [UseFormsAuthenticationWithoutSsl] setting to connect despite the security risk.”

Will this or has it already transmitted connection data as clear text?

Hey Dusty –

Assuming I’m on the right track (hard to say), I ran the job for SharePoint after editing the key (aka password) and assigning the newly created Connection at the folder level for “0. Collection”.

Whew…there’s a lot that can go wrong. I’m trying and sorry if I appear obtuse – I’m very literal certainly.

Any thoughts on this one?

Hey Dusty –

I’m thinking this should say “key” where it says password. Assuming I’m correct, it can get confusing as there is a password as part of the key.

Should it be key for the green boxes below?

Hey Dusty –

I decided it wouldn’t hurt to change the $appName parameter to “newapp” without quotes and it appeared to work. A browser window did open and it is the first one shown below on the left – I waited quite some time but it never showed so I refreshed and still nothing. So, I went to the second shot as shown on the right and Admin consent was already granted for all applications.

I’m following the remainder of the directions.

Hey Dusty –

Note: I’m wondering  if a call might help? Asking because this is time consuming to provide these sorts of emails and feel like the in a fraction of the time I’m preparing what I hope is a complete description of my current experience, it would be working.

I made an assumption that “edit” was really Properties (in the Tasks area), then click Configure, then click Parameters, then click $appName, then click Edit as shown below.  Was this a correct assumption?

Ran the job and under Status it shows….

Connect Status (encouraging)
[cid:06d0e8c1-fe2c-4614-897c-cb217c872e39@Image_18_]

Job Stats (interesting but would help to have some kind of status indicator even if just “expected”)

Task Stats (something went wrong)

Bill,

Correct on the newapp pwd this would need to be noted somewhere internal for later reference.

Being that this is the Recommended way to set up new Azure (Entra) apps It should have been listed in the SPO guide section you noted, I have submitted feed back to the Doc team to address this.

There are also similar jobs for EXO and AzureAD/Entra ID (Entra ID Inventory) Requirements, Permissions, and Ports should reference the AADI_RegisterAzureAppAuth which is currently not documented in the 11.6 guide being that this job is the recommended method to setup/update the needed Azure App registration, Feedback as again been submitted.

For Exchange Online Auditing Configuration does note the recommend EX_RegisterAzureAppAuth to setup the needed App Registration.

Please let me know if you have issues with these jobs to be able to setup the needed Azure App registrations or the scans following.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hey Dusty –

Thanks again for reply. On the documentation page from email below, it mentions

“A credential with the username newapp that contains the password for the new application”

Password for new application? Is this something I just make up and the job will use that?

How should I have known to install that instant job? I had gone through manually granted the application and delegated permissions per directions here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/SharePoint.htm


Is this instant job doing the same thing?

Thanks in advance,

Hello Dusty –

Thanks for quick response!

Bill,

Thank you for reaching out to support.

Is this for Novacoast internally or one of your customers? If one of your customers please identify so we can correctly update the ticket

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR

Is this for SharePoint On Prem or Online?

Could we get an Export of the Job in question for review?
Example:
[cid:e3140761-a5e4-4d4f-b1ad-5e3abd13cb05@Image_33_]   [cid:147320bb-400d-42c6-91f8-b561217a5caa@Image_34_]

The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.
