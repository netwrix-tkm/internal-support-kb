Scan issues with every collector

FIPS hash issues + fixed in a previous hotfix, but the config file was never updated since the installation of the hotfix predated the enablement of SPAA/SPSEEK

INI file not found, two hosts instead of one.
On this meeting we have confirmed that first two SP jobs work properly but we have encountered issues with 3-SPAC. We tried to manually assign a single host, but it didn't change the connect status info, where it shows two hosts. 

The logs showed access denied despite other collectors for SP working fine. We have found that the similar issue was fixed in the following version: 11.6.0.115 Released October 23rd, 2024

We have suggested installing latest version to see if it fixes the issue and are awaiting confirmation from you.

After the upgrade the client reports that all collectors fail with an error, investigating

3-FSAC is the main culprit, setting up through NAM results in NAM erroring out on

Customer asked to put ticket on hold until license is renewed, I've requested updated from customer's network team, since package capture shows potential issues with TLS handshake.

Postponing until Monday 3/17/2025

We had a call with the customer. We asked the customer to execute a PowerShell snippet that mimics what NAM is doing.

If the script can connect to manage.office.com, the script should result with the 401 Unauthorized error. On the other hand, if the script, like NAM agent, cannot connect to manage.office.com, it should fail with some other connection error.

I hoped that the script would fail to connect and we would reproduce the problem in PowerShell. Unfortunately, the script managed to connect (401 Unauthorized). So, both the browser and powershell can connect, but not NAM.

I still think that it must be some firewall/security product that blocks the connection. NAM uses exactly the same piece of code to connect to login.microsoftonline.com, graph.microsoft.com and manage.office.com. The former two work, but the latter fails. It fails with a FIN packet that arrives incredibly quickly (less than 1ms).

We asked the customer to do two things:
1. Verify their firewall to see if there are any signs of blocked connections.
2. Try to deploy an agent to another server/workstation and configure SharePoint Online monitoring there to see if the problem is reproducible.","Checking the logs after T2 consultation

Awaiting the installation of the last build.
