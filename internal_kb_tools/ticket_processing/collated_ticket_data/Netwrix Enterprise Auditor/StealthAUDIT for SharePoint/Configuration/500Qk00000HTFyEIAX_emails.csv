HI Damir

I got all license except network activity monitor ,

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.


What I have done so far



  1.  Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed
  2.  Activated threat manager and prevention .

HI Damir

I got all license except network activity monitor ,

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.


What I have done so far



  1.  Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed
  2.  Activated threat manager and prevention .

HI Damir

 

I got all license except network activity monitor , 

 

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.

 

 

What I have done so far

 

 


	Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed 
	Activated threat manager and prevention .

HI Damir

 

I got all license except network activity monitor , 

 

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.

 

 

What I have done so far

 

 


	Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed 
	Activated threat manager and prevention .

HI Damir

I got all license except network activity monitor ,

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.


What I have done so far



  1.  Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed
  2.  Activated threat manager and prevention .

You've asked about PublisherIdentifier, you can refer this article as there's a description for it:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference

We can confirm that there's nothing wrong with the PublisherIdentifier value the product uses.

Speaking of the rate limiting or throttling. If the PublisherIdentifier was not present in our requests or it was invalid/blocked, then Microsoft would impose a lower rate limit on our product. Even if that happened, the product would be able to respect the reduced limit and query data at lower rate.

If the your network team cannot find the cause, we can try to replicate the issue in a PowerShell script.

HI Damir

 

I got all license except network activity monitor , 

 

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.

 

 

What I have done so far

 

 


	Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed 
	Activated threat manager and prevention .

Hi Damir


Thank you very much for the help and it is very clear that there is no issue with the TLS with our infra team.

I have done some troubleshooting , please help with the issue as it is going for long time, and I am not able to show the management ROI for the Netwrix product .
After the upgrade to latest version few entra jobs are failing , active directory jobs are failing in auditor software ,


Quick question — does the Netwrix team usually run software testing before rolling out patch updates? 😊



  1.  Last time we created new client secret and from Netwrix it shows connectivity is successful . I have checked the api permissions and all are good as per the Netwrix document .

[cid:image001.png@01DBA92A.E1CF9580]


✅ You're successfully reaching the API
✅ You're using TLS correctly
❌ But the API is rejecting your access token

Hi Kannan, we've checked logs with development team, development team's verdict is still the same, there's an issue with SSL handshake.

You've asked about PublisherIdentifier, you can refer this article as there's a description for it:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference

We can confirm that there's nothing wrong with the PublisherIdentifier value the product uses.

Speaking of the rate limiting or throttling. If the PublisherIdentifier was not present in our requests or it was invalid/blocked, then Microsoft would impose a lower rate limit on our product. Even if that happened, the product would be able to respect the reduced limit and query data at lower rate.

If the your network team cannot find the cause, we can try to replicate the issue in a PowerShell script.

Damir Akhmatshin

HI Damir

I got all license except network activity monitor ,

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.


What I have done so far



  1.  Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed
  2.  Activated threat manager and prevention .

Thank you very much for the help and it is very clear that there is no issue with the TLS with our infra team.

 

I have done some troubleshooting , please help with the issue as it is going for long time, and I am not able to show the management ROI for the Netwrix product . 

After the upgrade to latest version few entra jobs are failing , active directory jobs are failing in auditor software , 

 

 

Quick question — does the Netwrix team usually run software testing before rolling out patch updates? 😊

 

 


	Last time we created new client secret and from Netwrix it shows connectivity is successful . I have checked the api permissions and all are good as per the Netwrix document . 


 



 

 

✅ You're successfully reaching the API
✅ You're using TLS correctly
❌ But the API is rejecting your access token

Hi Kannan, we've checked logs with development team, development team's verdict is still the same, there's an issue with SSL handshake.

You've asked about PublisherIdentifier, you can refer this article as there's a description for it:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference

We can confirm that there's nothing wrong with the PublisherIdentifier value the product uses.

Speaking of the rate limiting or throttling. If the PublisherIdentifier was not present in our requests or it was invalid/blocked, then Microsoft would impose a lower rate limit on our product. Even if that happened, the product would be able to respect the reduced limit and query data at lower rate.

If the your network team cannot find the cause, we can try to replicate the issue in a PowerShell script.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

HI Damir

 

I got all license except network activity monitor , 

 

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.

 

 

What I have done so far

 

 


	Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed 
	Activated threat manager and prevention .

Hi Damir

 

 

Thank you very much for the help and it is very clear that there is no issue with the TLS with our infra team.

 

I have done some troubleshooting , please help with the issue as it is going for long time, and I am not able to show the management ROI for the Netwrix product . 

After the upgrade to latest version few entra jobs are failing , active directory jobs are failing in auditor software , 

 

 

Quick question — does the Netwrix team usually run software testing before rolling out patch updates? 😊

 

 

Last time we created new client secret and from Netwrix it shows connectivity is successful . I have checked the api permissions and all are good as per the Netwrix document .

✅ You're successfully reaching the API
✅ You're using TLS correctly
❌ But the API is rejecting your access token

Hi Kannan, we've checked logs with development team, development team's verdict is still the same, there's an issue with SSL handshake.

You've asked about PublisherIdentifier, you can refer this article as there's a description for it:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference

We can confirm that there's nothing wrong with the PublisherIdentifier value the product uses.

Speaking of the rate limiting or throttling. If the PublisherIdentifier was not present in our requests or it was invalid/blocked, then Microsoft would impose a lower rate limit on our product. Even if that happened, the product would be able to respect the reduced limit and query data at lower rate.

If the your network team cannot find the cause, we can try to replicate the issue in a PowerShell script.

Damir Akhmatshin

HI Damir

 

I got all license except network activity monitor , 

 

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.

 

 

What I have done so far

 

 

Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed Activated threat manager and prevention .

We've ran the Powershell script and confirmed the same behaviour even outside of our application, there must me a network issue with SSL when connecting to manage.office.com.

Suggestions from our team are following:

1. Check firewall output and if there's any blocking for manage.office.com.
2. Install Netwrix Activity Monitor agent to a different host and confirm or deny on observing the same behaviour.

Regarding SPAA jobs - they do not use Activity Monitor agent, so upgrade of the Netwrix Activity Monitor shouldn't have to affect those jobs, instead in logs you've provided I can see this entry that suggests that FIPS is enabled and might be interfering workflow of our jobs, so this issue might have occurred after Netwrix Access Analyzer was upgraded.

08/04/2025 05:41:25  DEBUG  SHAREPOINTACCESS  Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Tasks.ScanSharePointAccessTask.InternalProcessRecord  ""[C:70] Failure processing Resource(SiteCollection|733|RH-Test Team - Test Private Channel 2).ISharePointGroup Child:null Error Details: Message=Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.  Source=mscorlib  Type=System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException  Data=EMPTY  StackTrace=   at System.RuntimeMethodHandle.InvokeMethod(Object target, Object[] arguments, Signature sig, Boolean constructor)     at System.Reflection.RuntimeConstructorInfo.Invoke(BindingFlags invokeAttr, Binder binder, Object[] parameters, CultureInfo culture)     at System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(String name, Object[] args)     at System.Security.Cryptography.MD5.Create()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.AccountManagement.TrusteeHelper.GetLoginNameHashAlgorithm()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.AccountManagement.TrusteeHelper.CreateSecurityIdentifierFromSiteCollectionLoginName(Int64 siteCollectionId, String loginName)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.GetOrCreateTrusteeFromGroup(ISharePointGroup group, Resource resource)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.ProcessSiteCollection_StoreGroup(ISharePointGroup group, Resource siteCollectionResource, Object& state)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.<>c__DisplayClass20_0`2.<ProcessQuery_Enumerate>b__1(TResult o, Resource r)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.QueryEnumerate[TSource,TResult](Func`3 query, TSource parentSharePointObject, Resource parentResource, Action`2 processChild, String processingDescription)  HResult=-2146232828  InnerException=    Message=This implementation is not part of the Windows Platform FIPS validated cryptographic algorithms.    Source=mscorlib    Type=System.InvalidOperationException    Data=EMPTY    StackTrace=   at System.Security.Cryptography.MD5CryptoServiceProvider..ctor()    HResult=-2146233079  "" 

This is a different issue that is not related with Activity Monitor.

I can recommend trying if temporary disabling FIPS works as first troubleshooting step:
 

	On the computer where Netwrix Access Analyzer is installed, open Registry Editor.
	
	Go to the following path: HKLMSystemCurrentControlSetControlLsaFIPSAlgorithmPolicyEnabled. This registry value reflects the current FIPS setting.
	
	Set the value to 0 for disabled.
	

Please log a separate ticket to cover this issue.

Hi Kannan, we would need to run a Powershell script on upcoming meeting, you can find this script below:

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Web

$installPath = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path ""HKLM:SOFTWARENetwrix Activity Monitor Agent 64-bit"" -Name InstallLocation
$agentVersion = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path ""HKLM:SOFTWARENetwrix Activity Monitor Agent 64-bit"" -Name Version
cd ""$installPathnet472""
$httpHandler = [System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler]::new()
$client = [System.Net.Http.HttpClient]::new($httpHandler)
$client.Timeout = [System.TimeSpan]::FromSeconds(180)
$client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(""User-Agent"", ""ISV|Netwrix|Activity Monitor|$agentVersion"")
$request = [System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage]::new([System.Net.Http.HttpMethod]::Get, ""https://manage.office.com/api/v1.0/071ca16e-d213-461f-9ab1-081b0144c15a/activity/feed/subscriptions/list?PublisherIdentifier=097499ff-179d-4959-ab02-86d364125bfc"")

$request.Headers.Accept.Add([System.Net.Http.Headers.MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue]::new(""application/json""))
$client.SendAsync($request).Result

Hi Damir

 

 

Thank you very much for the help and it is very clear that there is no issue with the TLS with our infra team.

 

I have done some troubleshooting , please help with the issue as it is going for long time, and I am not able to show the management ROI for the Netwrix product . 

After the upgrade to latest version few entra jobs are failing , active directory jobs are failing in auditor software , 

 

 

Quick question — does the Netwrix team usually run software testing before rolling out patch updates? 😊

 

 

Last time we created new client secret and from Netwrix it shows connectivity is successful . I have checked the api permissions and all are good as per the Netwrix document . 

 

[Inline image name : image001.png]

 

 

✅ You're successfully reaching the API
✅ You're using TLS correctly
❌ But the API is rejecting your access token

Hi Kannan, we've checked logs with development team, development team's verdict is still the same, there's an issue with SSL handshake.

You've asked about PublisherIdentifier, you can refer this article as there's a description for it:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference

We can confirm that there's nothing wrong with the PublisherIdentifier value the product uses.

Speaking of the rate limiting or throttling. If the PublisherIdentifier was not present in our requests or it was invalid/blocked, then Microsoft would impose a lower rate limit on our product. Even if that happened, the product would be able to respect the reduced limit and query data at lower rate.

If the your network team cannot find the cause, we can try to replicate the issue in a PowerShell script.

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Kannan, thank you for your time on meeting today, we've reviewed the current status of the issue. We've ran the Powershell script and confirmed the same behaviour even outside of our application, there must me a network issue with SSL when connecting to manage.office.com.

Suggestions from our team are following:

1. Check firewall output and if there's any blocking for manage.office.com.
2. Install Netwrix Activity Monitor agent to a different host and confirm or deny on observing the same behaviour.

Regarding SPAA jobs - they do not use Activity Monitor agent, so upgrade of the Netwrix Activity Monitor shouldn't have to affect those jobs, instead in logs you've provided I can see this entry that suggests that FIPS is enabled and might be interfering workflow of our jobs, so this issue might have occurred after Netwrix Access Analyzer was upgraded.

08/04/2025 05:41:25  DEBUG  SHAREPOINTACCESS  Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Tasks.ScanSharePointAccessTask.InternalProcessRecord  ""[C:70] Failure processing Resource(SiteCollection|733|RH-Test Team - Test Private Channel 2).ISharePointGroup Child:null Error Details: Message=Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.  Source=mscorlib  Type=System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException  Data=EMPTY  StackTrace=   at System.RuntimeMethodHandle.InvokeMethod(Object target, Object[] arguments, Signature sig, Boolean constructor)     at System.Reflection.RuntimeConstructorInfo.Invoke(BindingFlags invokeAttr, Binder binder, Object[] parameters, CultureInfo culture)     at System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(String name, Object[] args)     at System.Security.Cryptography.MD5.Create()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.AccountManagement.TrusteeHelper.GetLoginNameHashAlgorithm()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.AccountManagement.TrusteeHelper.CreateSecurityIdentifierFromSiteCollectionLoginName(Int64 siteCollectionId, String loginName)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.GetOrCreateTrusteeFromGroup(ISharePointGroup group, Resource resource)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.ProcessSiteCollection_StoreGroup(ISharePointGroup group, Resource siteCollectionResource, Object& state)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.<>c__DisplayClass20_0`2.<ProcessQuery_Enumerate>b__1(TResult o, Resource r)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.QueryEnumerate[TSource,TResult](Func`3 query, TSource parentSharePointObject, Resource parentResource, Action`2 processChild, String processingDescription)  HResult=-2146232828  InnerException=    Message=This implementation is not part of the Windows Platform FIPS validated cryptographic algorithms.    Source=mscorlib    Type=System.InvalidOperationException    Data=EMPTY    StackTrace=   at System.Security.Cryptography.MD5CryptoServiceProvider..ctor()    HResult=-2146233079  "" 

This is a different issue that is not related with Activity Monitor.

I can recommend trying if temporary disabling FIPS works as first troubleshooting step:
 

	On the computer where Netwrix Access Analyzer is installed, open Registry Editor.
	
	Go to the following path: HKLMSystemCurrentControlSetControlLsaFIPSAlgorithmPolicyEnabled. This registry value reflects the current FIPS setting.
	
	Set the value to 0 for disabled.
	

Please log a separate ticket to cover this issue.

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Kannan, we would need to run a Powershell script on upcoming meeting, you can find this script below:

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Web

$installPath = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path ""HKLM:SOFTWARENetwrix Activity Monitor Agent 64-bit"" -Name InstallLocation

$client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(""User-Agent"", ""ISV|Netwrix|Activity Monitor|$agentVersion"")
$request = [System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage]::new([System.Net.Http.HttpMethod]::Get, ""https://manage.office.com/api/v1.0/071ca16e-d213-461f-9ab1-081b0144c15a/activity/feed/subscriptions/list?PublisherIdentifier=097499ff-179d-4959-ab02-86d364125bfc"")

Hi Kannan, the answer for your question is yes, we do run testing before releasing a new build.

Please book a meeting using this link, I've invited member of development team to attend, please invite someone from your infrastructure team who's responsible for Sharepoint Online component.

Hi Damir

 

 

Thank you very much for the help and it is very clear that there is no issue with the TLS with our infra team.

 

I have done some troubleshooting , please help with the issue as it is going for long time, and I am not able to show the management ROI for the Netwrix product . 

After the upgrade to latest version few entra jobs are failing , active directory jobs are failing in auditor software , 

 

 

Quick question — does the Netwrix team usually run software testing before rolling out patch updates? 😊

 

 

Last time we created new client secret and from Netwrix it shows connectivity is successful . I have checked the api permissions and all are good as per the Netwrix document .

✅ You're successfully reaching the API
✅ You're using TLS correctly
❌ But the API is rejecting your access token

Hi Kannan, we've checked logs with development team, development team's verdict is still the same, there's an issue with SSL handshake.

You've asked about PublisherIdentifier, you can refer this article as there's a description for it:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference

We can confirm that there's nothing wrong with the PublisherIdentifier value the product uses.

Speaking of the rate limiting or throttling. If the PublisherIdentifier was not present in our requests or it was invalid/blocked, then Microsoft would impose a lower rate limit on our product. Even if that happened, the product would be able to respect the reduced limit and query data at lower rate.

If the your network team cannot find the cause, we can try to replicate the issue in a PowerShell script.

Damir Akhmatshin

HI Damir

 

I got all license except network activity monitor , 

 

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.

 

 

What I have done so far

 

 

Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed Activated threat manager and prevention .

Hi Kannan, thank you for your time on meeting today, we've reviewed the current status of the issue. We've ran the Powershell script and confirmed the same behaviour even outside of our application, there must me a network issue with SSL when connecting to manage.office.com.

Suggestions from our team are following:

1. Check firewall output and if there's any blocking for manage.office.com.
2. Install Netwrix Activity Monitor agent to a different host and confirm or deny on observing the same behaviour.

Regarding SPAA jobs - they do not use Activity Monitor agent, so upgrade of the Netwrix Activity Monitor shouldn't have to affect those jobs, instead in logs you've provided I can see this entry that suggests that FIPS is enabled and might be interfering workflow of our jobs, so this issue might have occurred after Netwrix Access Analyzer was upgraded.

08/04/2025 05:41:25  DEBUG  SHAREPOINTACCESS  Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Tasks.ScanSharePointAccessTask.InternalProcessRecord  ""[C:70] Failure processing Resource(SiteCollection|733|RH-Test Team - Test Private Channel 2).ISharePointGroup Child:null Error Details: Message=Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.

This is a different issue that is not related with Activity Monitor.

I can recommend trying if temporary disabling FIPS works as first troubleshooting step:


  1.  On the computer where Netwrix Access Analyzer is installed, open Registry Editor.
  2.  Go to the following path: HKLMSystemCurrentControlSetControlLsaFIPSAlgorithmPolicyEnabled. This registry value reflects the current FIPS setting.
  3.  Set the value to 0 for disabled.

Please log a separate ticket to cover this issue.

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Kannan, we would need to run a Powershell script on upcoming meeting, you can find this script below:

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Net.Http
$installPath = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path ""HKLM:SOFTWARENetwrix Activity Monitor Agent 64-bit"" -Name InstallLocation

cd ""$installPathnet472""
$httpHandler = [System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler]::new()
$client = [System.Net.Http.HttpClient]::new($httpHandler)
$client.Timeout = [System.TimeSpan]::FromSeconds(180)
$client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(""User-Agent"", ""ISV|Netwrix|Activity Monitor|$agentVersion"")
$request = [System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage]::new([System.Net.Http.HttpMethod]::Get, ""https://manage.office.com/api/v1.0/071ca16e-d213-461f-9ab1-081b0144c15a/activity/feed/subscriptions/list?PublisherIdentifier=097499ff-179d-4959-ab02-86d364125bfc"")<https://manage.office.com/api/v1.0/071ca16e-d213-461f-9ab1-081b0144c15a/activity/feed/subscriptions/list?PublisherIdentifier=097499ff-179d-4959-ab02-86d364125bfc%22)>

Hi Damir


Thank you very much for the help and it is very clear that there is no issue with the TLS with our infra team.

I have done some troubleshooting , please help with the issue as it is going for long time, and I am not able to show the management ROI for the Netwrix product .
After the upgrade to latest version few entra jobs are failing , active directory jobs are failing in auditor software ,


Quick question — does the Netwrix team usually run software testing before rolling out patch updates? 😊



  1.  Last time we created new client secret and from Netwrix it shows connectivity is successful . I have checked the api permissions and all are good as per the Netwrix document .

[cid:image001.png@01DBADFA.1D55E7C0]


✅ You're successfully reaching the API
✅ You're using TLS correctly
❌ But the API is rejecting your access token

Hi Kannan, we've checked logs with development team, development team's verdict is still the same, there's an issue with SSL handshake.

You've asked about PublisherIdentifier, you can refer this article as there's a description for it:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference

We can confirm that there's nothing wrong with the PublisherIdentifier value the product uses.

Speaking of the rate limiting or throttling. If the PublisherIdentifier was not present in our requests or it was invalid/blocked, then Microsoft would impose a lower rate limit on our product. Even if that happened, the product would be able to respect the reduced limit and query data at lower rate.

If the your network team cannot find the cause, we can try to replicate the issue in a PowerShell script.

Damir Akhmatshin

HI Damir

I got all license except network activity monitor ,

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.


What I have done so far



  1.  Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed
  2.  Activated threat manager and prevention .

Hi Kannan, thank you for your time on meeting today, we've reviewed the current status of the issue. We've ran the Powershell script and confirmed the same behaviour even outside of our application, there must me a network issue with SSL when connecting to manage.office.com.

Suggestions from our team are following:

1. Check firewall output and if there's any blocking for manage.office.com.
2. Install Netwrix Activity Monitor agent to a different host and confirm or deny on observing the same behaviour.

Regarding SPAA jobs - they do not use Activity Monitor agent, so upgrade of the Netwrix Activity Monitor shouldn't have to affect those jobs, instead in logs you've provided I can see this entry that suggests that FIPS is enabled and might be interfering workflow of our jobs, so this issue might have occurred after Netwrix Access Analyzer was upgraded.

This is a different issue that is not related with Activity Monitor.

I can recommend trying if temporary disabling FIPS works as first troubleshooting step:


  1.  On the computer where Netwrix Access Analyzer is installed, open Registry Editor.
  2.  Go to the following path: HKLMSystemCurrentControlSetControlLsaFIPSAlgorithmPolicyEnabled. This registry value reflects the current FIPS setting.
  3.  Set the value to 0 for disabled.

Please log a separate ticket to cover this issue.

cd ""$installPathnet472""
$httpHandler = [System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler]::new()
$client = [System.Net.Http.HttpClient]::new($httpHandler)
$client.Timeout = [System.TimeSpan]::FromSeconds(180)

Hi Damir


Thank you very much for the help and it is very clear that there is no issue with the TLS with our infra team.

I have done some troubleshooting , please help with the issue as it is going for long time, and I am not able to show the management ROI for the Netwrix product .
After the upgrade to latest version few entra jobs are failing , active directory jobs are failing in auditor software ,


Quick question — does the Netwrix team usually run software testing before rolling out patch updates? 😊



  1.  Last time we created new client secret and from Netwrix it shows connectivity is successful . I have checked the api permissions and all are good as per the Netwrix document .

[cid:image005.png@01DBAEBB.C5CB8B50]


✅ You're successfully reaching the API
✅ You're using TLS correctly
❌ But the API is rejecting your access token

Hi Kannan, we've checked logs with development team, development team's verdict is still the same, there's an issue with SSL handshake.

You've asked about PublisherIdentifier, you can refer this article as there's a description for it:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference

We can confirm that there's nothing wrong with the PublisherIdentifier value the product uses.

Speaking of the rate limiting or throttling. If the PublisherIdentifier was not present in our requests or it was invalid/blocked, then Microsoft would impose a lower rate limit on our product. Even if that happened, the product would be able to respect the reduced limit and query data at lower rate.

If the your network team cannot find the cause, we can try to replicate the issue in a PowerShell script.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

HI Damir

I got all license except network activity monitor ,

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.


What I have done so far



  1.  Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed
  2.  Activated threat manager and prevention .

Hi Kannan, thank you for your time on meeting today, we've reviewed the current status of the issue. We've ran the Powershell script and confirmed the same behaviour even outside of our application, there must me a network issue with SSL when connecting to manage.office.com.

Suggestions from our team are following:

1. Check firewall output and if there's any blocking for manage.office.com.
2. Install Netwrix Activity Monitor agent to a different host and confirm or deny on observing the same behaviour.

Regarding SPAA jobs - they do not use Activity Monitor agent, so upgrade of the Netwrix Activity Monitor shouldn't have to affect those jobs, instead in logs you've provided I can see this entry that suggests that FIPS is enabled and might be interfering workflow of our jobs, so this issue might have occurred after Netwrix Access Analyzer was upgraded.

08/04/2025 05:41:25  DEBUG  SHAREPOINTACCESS  Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Tasks.ScanSharePointAccessTask.InternalProcessRecord  ""[C:70] Failure processing Resource(SiteCollection|733|RH-Test Team - Test Private Channel 2).ISharePointGroup Child:null Error Details: Message=Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation.  Source=mscorlib  Type=System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException  Data=EMPTY  StackTrace=   at System.RuntimeMethodHandle.InvokeMethod(Object target, Object[] arguments, Signature sig, Boolean constructor)     at System.Reflection.RuntimeConstructorInfo.Invoke(BindingFlags invokeAttr, Binder binder, Object[] parameters, CultureInfo culture)     at System.Security.Cryptography.CryptoConfig.CreateFromName(String name, Object[] args)     at System.Security.Cryptography.MD5.Create()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.AccountManagement.TrusteeHelper.GetLoginNameHashAlgorithm()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.AccountManagement.TrusteeHelper.CreateSecurityIdentifierFromSiteCollectionLoginName(Int64 siteCollectionId, String loginName)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.GetOrCreateTrusteeFromGroup(ISharePointGroup group, Resource resource)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.ProcessSiteCollection_StoreGroup(ISharePointGroup group, Resource siteCollectionResource, Object& state)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.<>c__DisplayClass20_0`2.<ProcessQuery_Enumerate>b__1(TResult o, Resource r)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.SPAA.Scanning.SharePointTasks.QueryEnumerate[TSource,TResult](Func`3 query, TSource parentSharePointObject, Resource parentResource, Action`2 processChild, String processingDescription)  HResult=-2146232828  InnerException=    Message=This implementation is not part of the Windows Platform FIPS validated cryptographic algorithms.    Source=mscorlib    Type=System.InvalidOperationException    Data=EMPTY    StackTrace=   at System.Security.Cryptography.MD5CryptoServiceProvider..ctor()    HResult=-2146233079  "" 

This is a different issue that is not related with Activity Monitor.

I can recommend trying if temporary disabling FIPS works as first troubleshooting step:
 

On the computer where Netwrix Access Analyzer is installed, open Registry Editor.Go to the following path: HKLMSystemCurrentControlSetControlLsaFIPSAlgorithmPolicyEnabled. This registry value reflects the current FIPS setting.Set the value to 0 for disabled.

Please log a separate ticket to cover this issue.

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Kannan, we would need to run a Powershell script on upcoming meeting, you can find this script below:

$installPath = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path ""HKLM:SOFTWARENetwrix Activity Monitor Agent 64-bit"" -Name InstallLocation

cd ""$installPathnet472""
$httpHandler = [System.Net.Http.HttpClientHandler]::new()
$client = [System.Net.Http.HttpClient]::new($httpHandler)
$client.Timeout = [System.TimeSpan]::FromSeconds(180)
$client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(""User-Agent"", ""ISV|Netwrix|Activity Monitor|$agentVersion"")
$request = [System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage]::new([System.Net.Http.HttpMethod]::Get, ""https://manage.office.com/api/v1.0/071ca16e-d213-461f-9ab1-081b0144c15a/activity/feed/subscriptions/list?PublisherIdentifier=097499ff-179d-4959-ab02-86d364125bfc"")
$request.Headers.Authorization = [System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue]::new(""Bearer"", ""abc"")
$request.Headers.Accept.Add([System.Net.Http.Headers.MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue]::new(""application/json""))

Hi Damir

 

 

Thank you very much for the help and it is very clear that there is no issue with the TLS with our infra team.

 

I have done some troubleshooting , please help with the issue as it is going for long time, and I am not able to show the management ROI for the Netwrix product . 

After the upgrade to latest version few entra jobs are failing , active directory jobs are failing in auditor software , 

 

 

Quick question — does the Netwrix team usually run software testing before rolling out patch updates? 😊

 

 

Last time we created new client secret and from Netwrix it shows connectivity is successful . I have checked the api permissions and all are good as per the Netwrix document . 

 

[Inline image name : image005.png]

 

 

✅ You're successfully reaching the API
✅ You're using TLS correctly
❌ But the API is rejecting your access token

Hi Kannan, we've checked logs with development team, development team's verdict is still the same, there's an issue with SSL handshake.

You've asked about PublisherIdentifier, you can refer this article as there's a description for it:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference

We can confirm that there's nothing wrong with the PublisherIdentifier value the product uses.

Speaking of the rate limiting or throttling. If the PublisherIdentifier was not present in our requests or it was invalid/blocked, then Microsoft would impose a lower rate limit on our product. Even if that happened, the product would be able to respect the reduced limit and query data at lower rate.

If the your network team cannot find the cause, we can try to replicate the issue in a PowerShell script.

Damir Akhmatshin

HI Damir

 

I got all license except network activity monitor , 

 

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.

 

 

What I have done so far

 

 

Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed Activated threat manager and prevention .

HI Damir

I got all license except network activity monitor ,

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.


What I have done so far



  1.  Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed
  2.  Activated threat manager and prevention .

The root cause for the issue was connection issue for Netwrix Activity Monitor agent to Sharepoint server to collect activity, following that we needed to add proper configuration to SPAC collector.

As agreed on meeting, I will close this ticket.

Please feel free to leave any feedback, it will help us to be more effective and productive.

P.S

On meeting we've discovered that your accounts do not have admin access in Access Information Center, as promised on meeting here's an article on console access levels:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/ConsoleAccess.htm

At the very bottom of this article there's an instruction on how to reset admin account if needed.

HI Damir

 

I got all license except network activity monitor , 

 

As per advice from Softcat account manager I have logged a ticket with Netwrix 00440826, once this is done and activate I can run the jobs.

 

 

What I have done so far

 

 


	Activated enterprise auditor (analyzer version 12) but jobs are failing due to activity monitor is unlicensed 
	Activated threat manager and prevention .

Hi Kannan, thank you for update, definitely, I will postpone this ticket until Monday, do you know when your license will be renewed so we can continue with troubleshooting?

Did you get any comments from network team regarding our network package analysis?
