We had a call with the customer. We asked the customer to execute a PowerShell snippet that mimics what NAM is doing.

```

If the script can connect to manage.office.com, the script should result with the 401 Unauthorized error. On the other hand, if the script, like NAM agent, cannot connect to manage.office.com, it should fail with some other connection error.

I hoped that the script would fail to connect and we would reproduce the problem in PowerShell. Unfortunately, the script managed to connect (401 Unauthorized). So, both the browser and powershell can connect, but not NAM.

I still think that it must be some firewall/security product that blocks the connection. NAM uses exactly the same piece of code to connect to login.microsoftonline.com, graph.microsoft.com and manage.office.com. The former two work, but the latter fails. It fails with a FIN packet that arrives incredibly quickly (less than 1ms).

We asked the customer to do two things:
1. Verify their firewall to see if there are any signs of blocked connections.
2. Try to deploy an agent to another server/workstation and configure SharePoint Online monitoring there to see if the problem is reproducible.","","","","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2025-04-11T05:10:16.000Z"
