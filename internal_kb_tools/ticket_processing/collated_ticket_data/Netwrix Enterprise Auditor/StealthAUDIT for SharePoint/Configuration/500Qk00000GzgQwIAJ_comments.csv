Does SpSEEK still also do SPAA collection (as historically) if so then can it be documented.

@Salesforce Hi Pasan,
In the past, we've worked around this issue by renaming the domain controller from ADI to ""None"" (See screenshot ""ADIDC"" in ""From Dev"" folder.
This might also be required if there is a change file for the job.
Then there are the two create scripts in the ""From Dev"" folder in the ""ADI_Scripts"" that can be run to build the necessary tables in SQL.
Once done you should be able to run the SPO scans with all the necessary AD tables now built. I'll work on getting this as a KB and create a ticket for a long-term solution in the product.
