Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one.

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting.

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn't show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

Update on progress. The job failed on the SystemScans part after 1 day of running. I tried it again and it failed at the same place again.

""Host process was terminated (DC did not abort timely)"".

The weird part is that no one is actually terminating the job. I've attached the logs to the ticket as well.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting. 

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn’t show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

 



 

Attached is the logs.

No further update yet. Another TPM was going to help dig in as Ethan wasn't available on the call today.

I'll push for one later this week. 

Any luck on that bulk import?

It looks like it’s still at the “Creating Trustee Map” section. I’ve attached the logs.

I am digging in on our side.

Did the scans time out again after 24 hours?

Update on progress. The job failed on the SystemScans part after 1 day of running. I tried it again and it failed at the same place again. 

 

“Host process was terminated (DC did not abort timely)”.

 

The weird part is that no one is actually terminating the job. I’ve attached the logs to the ticket as well.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one.

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting.

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn't show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

Update on progress. The job failed on the SystemScans part after 1 day of running. I tried it again and it failed at the same place again.

""Host process was terminated (DC did not abort timely)"".

The weird part is that no one is actually terminating the job. I've attached the logs to the ticket as well.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting. 

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn’t show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

 



 

Attached is the logs.

No further update yet. Another TPM was going to help dig in as Ethan wasn't available on the call today.

I'll push for one later this week. 

Any luck on that bulk import?

I am digging in on our side.

Did the scans time out again after 24 hours?

Update on progress. The job failed on the SystemScans part after 1 day of running. I tried it again and it failed at the same place again. 

 

“Host process was terminated (DC did not abort timely)”.

 

The weird part is that no one is actually terminating the job. I’ve attached the logs to the ticket as well.

Hey Brittany,

Lets skip our scheduled meeting today.

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one.

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting.

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn't show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

No further update yet. Another TPM was going to help dig in as Ethan wasn't available on the call today.

I'll push for one later this week.

Any luck on that bulk import?

Update on progress. The job failed on the SystemScans part after 1 day of running. I tried it again and it failed at the same place again.

""Host process was terminated (DC did not abort timely)"".

The weird part is that no one is actually terminating the job. I've attached the logs to the ticket as well.

Hey Brittany,

Lets skip our scheduled meeting today.

I have it on pretty good authority that it will be ready today, however thinking after Lunch.

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

 

Are there any other times you might be available next week? Just looking ahead since I believe we are looking at mid-week to get this through QA at earliest.

Sounds good!

 

If we don’t need to meet on Monday, feel free to cancel the meeting. I don’t think I have anything else to discuss other than this issue.

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting. 

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn’t show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

 



 

Attached is the logs.

No further update yet. Another TPM was going to help dig in as Ethan wasn't available on the call today.

I'll push for one later this week. 

Any luck on that bulk import?

Hey Brittany,

Lets skip our scheduled meeting today.

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Nick,

Hey Brittany,

 

Are there any other times you might be available next week? Just looking ahead since I believe we are looking at mid-week to get this through QA at earliest.

Sounds good!

 

If we don’t need to meet on Monday, feel free to cancel the meeting. I don’t think I have anything else to discuss other than this issue.

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting. 

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I'll update you as soon as I can. 

Confirmed another customer is in the same boat with this hotfix. So its not only you and will help keep this top priority for development.

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn’t show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

 



 

Attached is the logs.

No further update yet. Another TPM was going to help dig in as Ethan wasn't available on the call today.

I'll push for one later this week. 

Any luck on that bulk import?

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one.

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting.

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn't show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

I'll push for one later this week.

Any luck on that bulk import?

Do you still want me to setup a meeting? Is the hotfix considered the standard process because I can do it myself without needing a meeting.

Hey Brittany,

Lets skip our scheduled meeting today.

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one.

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting.

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn't show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Hi Nick,

 

Do you still want me to setup a meeting? Is the hotfix considered the standard process because I can do it myself without needing a meeting.

No worries. If the hotfix itself is standard of what we’ve done prior, I should be able to handle implementing it without needing to meet up.

Hey Brittany,

Lets skip our scheduled meeting today.

I have it on pretty good authority that it will be ready today, however thinking after Lunch.

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting. 

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn’t show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

No further update yet. Another TPM was going to help dig in as Ethan wasn't available on the call today.

I'll push for one later this week. 

Any luck on that bulk import?

Thanks,

I appreciate the update. I will push for an update from Development. 

I'd still let it roll for now, but I will see if I can get something before the end of the week.

Hey Brittany,

I wanted to check in and see if you were able to apply the hotfix and kick-off the SP SEEK scan?

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hi Nick,

Do you still want me to setup a meeting? Is the hotfix considered the standard process because I can do it myself without needing a meeting.

Hey Brittany,

Lets skip our scheduled meeting today.

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one.

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting.

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

ok. I will review those. Please end the task.

I'll update you as soon as I can.

Confirmed another customer is in the same boat with this hotfix. So its not only you and will help keep this top priority for development.

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn't show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

I'll push for one later this week.

Any luck on that bulk import?

Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

 

I wanted to check in and see if you were able to apply the hotfix and kick-off the SP SEEK scan?

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Hi Nick,

 

Do you still want me to setup a meeting? Is the hotfix considered the standard process because I can do it myself without needing a meeting.

No worries. If the hotfix itself is standard of what we’ve done prior, I should be able to handle implementing it without needing to meet up.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

 

Are there any other times you might be available next week? Just looking ahead since I believe we are looking at mid-week to get this through QA at earliest.

 


Thanks,

Sounds good!

 

If we don’t need to meet on Monday, feel free to cancel the meeting. I don’t think I have anything else to discuss other than this issue.

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting. 

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn’t show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

 



 

Attached is the logs.

No further update yet. Another TPM was going to help dig in as Ethan wasn't available on the call today.

I'll push for one later this week. 

Any luck on that bulk import?

Hi All,

I actually did not have enough time to put in the hot fix until just now. I've ran the scan but I ran into an error on the SPAA_SystemScans job. Below is the screenshot and attached the log. I ran the job twice just to make sure and both resulted in the same error message. I did take the opportunity to set the USN to 0 since the job wasn't working anyways.

________________________________

He Brittany,


Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip<https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip>

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one.

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting.

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn't show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

Hi All,

 

I actually did not have enough time to put in the hot fix until just now. I’ve ran the scan but I ran into an error on the SPAA_SystemScans job. Below is the screenshot and attached the log. I ran the job twice just to make sure and both resulted in the same error message. I did take the opportunity to set the USN to 0 since the job wasn’t working anyways.

He Brittany,
 

Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Hi Nick,

 

Do you still want me to setup a meeting? Is the hotfix considered the standard process because I can do it myself without needing a meeting.

Hi Nick,

 

That sounds good with me. Should we put something on the calendar as a placeholder? Maybe for tomorrow to get it more time?

Hey Brittany,

Lets skip our scheduled meeting today.

I have it on pretty good authority that it will be ready today, however thinking after Lunch.

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting. 

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn’t show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

 



 

Attached is the logs.

No further update yet. Another TPM was going to help dig in as Ethan wasn't available on the call today.

I'll push for one later this week. 

Any luck on that bulk import?

That seems to be something permissions related.

I'd quick doublecheck the profile and host are configured properly to the job.

I may be able to hop on a call a little later today, if you think you have time. Probably about 3:30 pm central or later.

Hi All,

 

I actually did not have enough time to put in the hot fix until just now. I’ve ran the scan but I ran into an error on the SPAA_SystemScans job. Below is the screenshot and attached the log. I ran the job twice just to make sure and both resulted in the same error message. I did take the opportunity to set the USN to 0 since the job wasn’t working anyways.

He Brittany,
 

Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Hi Nick,

 

Do you still want me to setup a meeting? Is the hotfix considered the standard process because I can do it myself without needing a meeting.

No worries. If the hotfix itself is standard of what we’ve done prior, I should be able to handle implementing it without needing to meet up.

Hi Nick,

 

That sounds good with me. Should we put something on the calendar as a placeholder? Maybe for tomorrow to get it more time?

Hey Brittany,

Lets skip our scheduled meeting today.

I have it on pretty good authority that it will be ready today, however thinking after Lunch.

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Thanks,

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting. 

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn’t show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

 



 

Attached is the logs.

No further update yet. Another TPM was going to help dig in as Ethan wasn't available on the call today.

I'll push for one later this week. 

Any luck on that bulk import?

We touched on Tay's SPAC ticket and got artifacts.

Our level 2 scan seems to be going quite a bit slower but still moving at an ok pace. I will see if Development can review and offer any ideas about the speed.

That seems to be something permissions related.

I'd quick doublecheck the profile and host are configured properly to the job.

I may be able to hop on a call a little later today, if you think you have time. Probably about 3:30 pm central or later.

Hi All,

 

I actually did not have enough time to put in the hot fix until just now. I’ve ran the scan but I ran into an error on the SPAA_SystemScans job. Below is the screenshot and attached the log. I ran the job twice just to make sure and both resulted in the same error message. I did take the opportunity to set the USN to 0 since the job wasn’t working anyways.

He Brittany,
 

Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hi Nick,

 

Do you still want me to setup a meeting? Is the hotfix considered the standard process because I can do it myself without needing a meeting.

No worries. If the hotfix itself is standard of what we’ve done prior, I should be able to handle implementing it without needing to meet up.

Hey Brittany,

Lets skip our scheduled meeting today.

I have it on pretty good authority that it will be ready today, however thinking after Lunch.

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting. 

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn’t show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

 



 

Attached is the logs.

No further update yet. Another TPM was going to help dig in as Ethan wasn't available on the call today.

I'll push for one later this week. 

Any luck on that bulk import?

Dev was looking to push to close this one and open a fresh one, but I want to make sure this at least imports.

Then if we want we can spin off a performance related one.

But I want to make sure this works before we change anything else.

Also since we are running a diff scan, the next run should be quicker, so its not as worrisome that this one, is slower than expected if that cooperates.

Thanks Brittany for meeting again today.

We touched on Tay's SPAC ticket and got artifacts.

Our level 2 scan seems to be going quite a bit slower but still moving at an ok pace. I will see if Development can review and offer any ideas about the speed.

That seems to be something permissions related.

I'd quick doublecheck the profile and host are configured properly to the job.

I may be able to hop on a call a little later today, if you think you have time. Probably about 3:30 pm central or later.

Thanks,

Hi All,

 

I actually did not have enough time to put in the hot fix until just now. I’ve ran the scan but I ran into an error on the SPAA_SystemScans job. Below is the screenshot and attached the log. I ran the job twice just to make sure and both resulted in the same error message. I did take the opportunity to set the USN to 0 since the job wasn’t working anyways.

He Brittany,
 

Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

 

I wanted to check in and see if you were able to apply the hotfix and kick-off the SP SEEK scan?

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Hi Nick,

 

Do you still want me to setup a meeting? Is the hotfix considered the standard process because I can do it myself without needing a meeting.

No worries. If the hotfix itself is standard of what we’ve done prior, I should be able to handle implementing it without needing to meet up.

Hey Brittany,

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting. 

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn’t show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

 



 

Attached is the logs.

No further update yet. Another TPM was going to help dig in as Ethan wasn't available on the call today.

I'll push for one later this week. 

Any luck on that bulk import?

Checking in on the scan. How are things looking on the scan?

Dev was looking to push to close this one and open a fresh one, but I want to make sure this at least imports.

Then if we want we can spin off a performance related one.

But I want to make sure this works before we change anything else.

Also since we are running a diff scan, the next run should be quicker, so its not as worrisome that this one, is slower than expected if that cooperates.


Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Thanks Brittany for meeting again today.

We touched on Tay's SPAC ticket and got artifacts.

Our level 2 scan seems to be going quite a bit slower but still moving at an ok pace. I will see if Development can review and offer any ideas about the speed.

Thanks,

That seems to be something permissions related.

I'd quick doublecheck the profile and host are configured properly to the job.

I may be able to hop on a call a little later today, if you think you have time. Probably about 3:30 pm central or later.

Thanks,

Hi All,

I actually did not have enough time to put in the hot fix until just now. I've ran the scan but I ran into an error on the SPAA_SystemScans job. Below is the screenshot and attached the log. I ran the job twice just to make sure and both resulted in the same error message. I did take the opportunity to set the USN to 0 since the job wasn't working anyways.

He Brittany,


Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip<https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip>

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one.

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting.

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn't show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

Any luck on that bulk import?

________________________________

Checking in on the scan. How are things looking on the scan?

Dev was looking to push to close this one and open a fresh one, but I want to make sure this at least imports.

Then if we want we can spin off a performance related one.

But I want to make sure this works before we change anything else.

Also since we are running a diff scan, the next run should be quicker, so its not as worrisome that this one, is slower than expected if that cooperates.


Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

Thanks Brittany for meeting again today.

We touched on Tay's SPAC ticket and got artifacts.

Our level 2 scan seems to be going quite a bit slower but still moving at an ok pace. I will see if Development can review and offer any ideas about the speed.

Thanks,

That seems to be something permissions related.

I'd quick doublecheck the profile and host are configured properly to the job.

I may be able to hop on a call a little later today, if you think you have time. Probably about 3:30 pm central or later.

Hi All,

I actually did not have enough time to put in the hot fix until just now. I've ran the scan but I ran into an error on the SPAA_SystemScans job. Below is the screenshot and attached the log. I ran the job twice just to make sure and both resulted in the same error message. I did take the opportunity to set the USN to 0 since the job wasn't working anyways.

He Brittany,


Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip<https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip>

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hi Nick,

That sounds good with me. Should we put something on the calendar as a placeholder? Maybe for tomorrow to get it more time?

Hey Brittany,

Lets skip our scheduled meeting today.

I have it on pretty good authority that it will be ready today, however thinking after Lunch.

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one.

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting.

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn't show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

________________________________

Checking in on the scan. How are things looking on the scan?

Dev was looking to push to close this one and open a fresh one, but I want to make sure this at least imports.

Then if we want we can spin off a performance related one.

But I want to make sure this works before we change anything else.

Also since we are running a diff scan, the next run should be quicker, so its not as worrisome that this one, is slower than expected if that cooperates.


Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

Thanks Brittany for meeting again today.

We touched on Tay's SPAC ticket and got artifacts.

Our level 2 scan seems to be going quite a bit slower but still moving at an ok pace. I will see if Development can review and offer any ideas about the speed.

Thanks,

That seems to be something permissions related.

I'd quick doublecheck the profile and host are configured properly to the job.

I may be able to hop on a call a little later today, if you think you have time. Probably about 3:30 pm central or later.

Thanks,

Hi All,

I actually did not have enough time to put in the hot fix until just now. I've ran the scan but I ran into an error on the SPAA_SystemScans job. Below is the screenshot and attached the log. I ran the job twice just to make sure and both resulted in the same error message. I did take the opportunity to set the USN to 0 since the job wasn't working anyways.

He Brittany,


Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one.

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Sounds good!

If we don't need to meet on Monday, feel free to cancel the meeting. I don't think I have anything else to discuss other than this issue.

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting.

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

ok. I will review those. Please end the task.

I'll update you as soon as I can.

Confirmed another customer is in the same boat with this hotfix. So its not only you and will help keep this top priority for development.

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn't show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

Any luck on that bulk import?

________________________________

Checking in on the scan. How are things looking on the scan?

Dev was looking to push to close this one and open a fresh one, but I want to make sure this at least imports.

Then if we want we can spin off a performance related one.

But I want to make sure this works before we change anything else.

Also since we are running a diff scan, the next run should be quicker, so its not as worrisome that this one, is slower than expected if that cooperates.


Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

Thanks Brittany for meeting again today.

We touched on Tay's SPAC ticket and got artifacts.

Our level 2 scan seems to be going quite a bit slower but still moving at an ok pace. I will see if Development can review and offer any ideas about the speed.

Thanks,

That seems to be something permissions related.

I'd quick doublecheck the profile and host are configured properly to the job.

I may be able to hop on a call a little later today, if you think you have time. Probably about 3:30 pm central or later.

Hi All,

I actually did not have enough time to put in the hot fix until just now. I've ran the scan but I ran into an error on the SPAA_SystemScans job. Below is the screenshot and attached the log. I ran the job twice just to make sure and both resulted in the same error message. I did take the opportunity to set the USN to 0 since the job wasn't working anyways.

He Brittany,


Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip<https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip>

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

That sounds good with me. Should we put something on the calendar as a placeholder? Maybe for tomorrow to get it more time?

Hey Brittany,

Lets skip our scheduled meeting today.

I have it on pretty good authority that it will be ready today, however thinking after Lunch.

I can send a message when I have it, and hopefully we can squeeze in some time this afternoon or tomorrow.

Thanks,

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one.

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Just a slight update, Development appears to have hit another bump in the testing, guessing it won't sneak out until next week.

I'll shoot an email out Monday morning if it will be available, otherwise may be worth skipping the Monday meeting.

Unless its available or you have any other questions in the short team. But we will see if Development can wrap it up in time or not.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

The job errored out with the same thing in the SystemScans job. However in this case the scheduled task thinks it still running even though it doesn't show in the Running Instances. Task Manager shows its still active as well.

1. Scan is still moving along for permissions. 
2. SPAC ticket has been raised priority will update later this week on what Dev finds.

John will look into what we can do for SEEK license to utilize the Differential.

I'll ask to confirm if we do go the SEEK route that we can take advantage of the SPAA T2 DB for Differential purposes.

Brittany if possible to get a number of sites/libraries for us to share with Dev. Current estimate with 8k sites and 20-40 libraries each. Looking at minimum likely total of 160k.

It looks like the time between the log entries is starting to increase from before. Not too terribly more but it looked a lot to me.

The SystemScan job is still running, it’s been over 16 days so far.

 

Attached is the log.

Checking in on the scan. How are things looking on the scan?

Dev was looking to push to close this one and open a fresh one, but I want to make sure this at least imports.

Then if we want we can spin off a performance related one.

But I want to make sure this works before we change anything else.

Also since we are running a diff scan, the next run should be quicker, so its not as worrisome that this one, is slower than expected if that cooperates.



Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Thanks Brittany for meeting again today.

We touched on Tay's SPAC ticket and got artifacts.

Our level 2 scan seems to be going quite a bit slower but still moving at an ok pace. I will see if Development can review and offer any ideas about the speed.

Thanks,

That seems to be something permissions related.

I'd quick doublecheck the profile and host are configured properly to the job.

I may be able to hop on a call a little later today, if you think you have time. Probably about 3:30 pm central or later.

Thanks,

Hi All,

 

I actually did not have enough time to put in the hot fix until just now. I’ve ran the scan but I ran into an error on the SPAA_SystemScans job. Below is the screenshot and attached the log. I ran the job twice just to make sure and both resulted in the same error message. I did take the opportunity to set the USN to 0 since the job wasn’t working anyways.

He Brittany,
 

Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

 

I wanted to check in and see if you were able to apply the hotfix and kick-off the SP SEEK scan?

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hi Nick,

 

Do you still want me to setup a meeting? Is the hotfix considered the standard process because I can do it myself without needing a meeting.

No worries. If the hotfix itself is standard of what we’ve done prior, I should be able to handle implementing it without needing to meet up.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.

Brief summary of todays meeting.

1. Scan is still moving along for permissions. 
2. SPAC ticket has been raised priority will update later this week on what Dev finds.

John will look into what we can do for SEEK license to utilize the Differential.

I'll ask to confirm if we do go the SEEK route that we can take advantage of the SPAA T2 DB for Differential purposes.

Brittany if possible to get a number of sites/libraries for us to share with Dev. Current estimate with 8k sites and 20-40 libraries each. Looking at minimum likely total of 160k.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

We’ll take a look at these logs and see what we can decipher! Would it be safe to say we are still seeing that same time between log entries today?

It looks like the time between the log entries is starting to increase from before. Not too terribly more but it looked a lot to me.

Attached is the log.

Checking in on the scan. How are things looking on the scan?

Dev was looking to push to close this one and open a fresh one, but I want to make sure this at least imports.

Then if we want we can spin off a performance related one.

But I want to make sure this works before we change anything else.

Also since we are running a diff scan, the next run should be quicker, so its not as worrisome that this one, is slower than expected if that cooperates.



Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Thanks Brittany for meeting again today.

We touched on Tay's SPAC ticket and got artifacts.

Our level 2 scan seems to be going quite a bit slower but still moving at an ok pace. I will see if Development can review and offer any ideas about the speed.

Thanks,

That seems to be something permissions related.

I'd quick doublecheck the profile and host are configured properly to the job.

I may be able to hop on a call a little later today, if you think you have time. Probably about 3:30 pm central or later.

Hi All,

 

I actually did not have enough time to put in the hot fix until just now. I’ve ran the scan but I ran into an error on the SPAA_SystemScans job. Below is the screenshot and attached the log. I ran the job twice just to make sure and both resulted in the same error message. I did take the opportunity to set the USN to 0 since the job wasn’t working anyways.

He Brittany,
 

Checking in due to one more note.

If the scan is still doing its thing that's fine.

If the Bulk Import is queued, you can remove that from the queue. We have to make a change with the USN before running the Bulk Import.

We need to edit the SA_SPAA_Hosts table for the tenant in order to change the USN value to 0.

We can help if you'd like shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Brittany,

Sorry forgot to send before lunch.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.068.zip

There is the link.

Standard drop and overwrite files as typical. Then just start a fresh SP Seek Scan. I'd run the scheduled task on the group so after the scan the import attempts.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hi Nick,

 

Do you still want me to setup a meeting? Is the hotfix considered the standard process because I can do it myself without needing a meeting.

No worries. If the hotfix itself is standard of what we’ve done prior, I should be able to handle implementing it without needing to meet up.

Hello Brittany,

Not sure if John reached out, I forgot yesterday.

Fix won't be available until next week. Guessing second half at this point.

They did find another bug and retesting after implementing a fix for that one. 

Probably don't need the Monday meeting unless you have more questions.
