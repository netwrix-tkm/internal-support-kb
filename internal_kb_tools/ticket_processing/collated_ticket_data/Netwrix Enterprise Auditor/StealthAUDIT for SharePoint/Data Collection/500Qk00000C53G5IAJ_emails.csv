On review of the error messages it looks like the service account for Sharepoint Online doesn't have access to certain resources.

	When did it start to happen?

Hi Aleksandr,

To answer your questions

  1.  When did it start to happen?

We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.

  1.  Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?
There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)
These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources.
We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?
SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?
I have uploaded the job log to the ticket.

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.
They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.
I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

Many Thanks
Nuala

	Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?
	Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?
	Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000C53G5:ref

Hi Aleksandr,

To answer your questions

  1.  When did it start to happen?

We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.

  1.  Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?
There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)
These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources.
We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?
SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?
I have uploaded the job log to the ticket.

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.
They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.
I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

Many Thanks
Nuala

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access.

We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages appeared ""error querying folder /sites/INV_FlowDevelopment/SiteAccess/ for files"".

Please ask your Sharepoint team if there are issues with accessing this site while the scan is running and let me know the result of the scan.
We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

Hi Alex,
The scan completed against the site and we got the same warning messages.

[cid:image001.png@01DACBD4.1E58C3D0]
I contacted Ciaran from the SharePoint Team and he requested I run the scan against another site and again I am getting the same warnings.

[cid:image002.png@01DACBD6.A176D390]

I would like to schedule a call and have our SharePoint contact Ciaran join so we can discuss.
Please can you send me a link to schedule a meeting.

Many Thanks

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000C53G5:ref

Hi Aleksandr,

To answer your questions

  1.  When did it start to happen?

We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.

  1.  Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?
There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)
These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources.
We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?
SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?
I have uploaded the job log to the ticket.

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.
They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.
I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

Many Thanks
Nuala

Hi Alex,

 

The scan completed against the site and we got the same warning messages.

 



 

I contacted Ciaran from the SharePoint Team and he requested I run the scan against another site and again I am getting the same warnings.

 



 

I would like to schedule a call and have our SharePoint contact Ciaran join so we can discuss.

Please can you send me a link to schedule a meeting.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access.

We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages appeared ""error querying folder /sites/INV_FlowDevelopment/SiteAccess/ for files"".

Please ask your Sharepoint team if there are issues with accessing this site while the scan is running and let me know the result of the scan.
We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

Best regards,

Hi Alex

We think the issues we are seeing on the SharePoint job on our production servers may be related to the older version of StealthAudit that we currently using 11.5.
We decided to run a  SPSeek scan on the test server which is running version 11.6 to see the results.
This scan is a non-differential  scan against the whole allstatecloud tenant at a depth of 3.
It is still running at the minute however we are seeing different errors now, screenshot below.

Can you advise what these errors may relate to?
Would you like to continue and have our meeting this morning or wait until this scan completes and discuss?

Thanks
Nuala

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access.

We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages appeared ""error querying folder /sites/INV_FlowDevelopment/SiteAccess/ for files"".

Please ask your Sharepoint team if there are issues with accessing this site while the scan is running and let me know the result of the scan.
We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000C53G5:ref

Hi Aleksandr,

To answer your questions

  1.  When did it start to happen?

We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.

  1.  Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?
There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)
These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources.
We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?
SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?
I have uploaded the job log to the ticket.

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.
They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.
I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

Many Thanks
Nuala

Hi Alex

 

We think the issues we are seeing on the SharePoint job on our production servers may be related to the older version of StealthAudit that we currently using 11.5.

We decided to run a  SPSeek scan on the test server which is running version 11.6 to see the results.

This scan is a non-differential  scan against the whole allstatecloud tenant at a depth of 3.

It is still running at the minute however we are seeing different errors now, screenshot below.

 

Can you advise what these errors may relate to?

Would you like to continue and have our meeting this morning or wait until this scan completes and discuss?

 

Thanks

Nuala

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

On review of the SP sites with Ciaran in the errors, it was noted that there are sites without access or they are Read-only.

In this case, the scope should be defined for the ""SPAA-System Scans"" job that should include the sites with access/exclude the sites without access/marked for deletion/not available.

Once you will have this scope configured please run the SPAA scan check for the Warnings/Errors and let us know the results.

Best regards,

Hi Alex

 

We think the issues we are seeing on the SharePoint job on our production servers may be related to the older version of StealthAudit that we currently using 11.5.

We decided to run a  SPSeek scan on the test server which is running version 11.6 to see the results.

This scan is a non-differential  scan against the whole allstatecloud tenant at a depth of 3.

It is still running at the minute however we are seeing different errors now, screenshot below.

 

Can you advise what these errors may relate to?

Would you like to continue and have our meeting this morning or wait until this scan completes and discuss?

 

Thanks

Nuala

Hi Team, Thank you for your time on the meeting today. We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access. We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access.

We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages appeared ""error querying folder /sites/INV_FlowDevelopment/SiteAccess/ for files"".

Please ask your Sharepoint team if there are issues with accessing this site while the scan is running and let me know the result of the scan.
We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

Best regards,

Hi Aleksandr,

 

To answer your questions


	When did it start to happen?


We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.


	Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?


There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)

These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources. 

We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud) 


	Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?


SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)


	Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?


I have uploaded the job log to the ticket. 

 

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.

They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.

I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

 

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

On review of the SP sites with Ciaran in the errors, it was noted that there are sites without access or they are Read-only.

In this case, the scope should be defined for the ""SPAA-System Scans"" job that should include the sites with access/exclude the sites without access/marked for deletion/not available.

Once you will have this scope configured please run the SPAA scan check for the Warnings/Errors and let us know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

On review of the SP sites with Ciaran in the errors, it was noted that there are sites without access or they are Read-only.

In this case, the scope should be defined for the ""SPAA-System Scans"" job that should include the sites with access/exclude the sites without access/marked for deletion/not available.

Once you will have this scope configured please run the SPAA scan check for the Warnings/Errors and let us know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Alex

 

We think the issues we are seeing on the SharePoint job on our production servers may be related to the older version of StealthAudit that we currently using 11.5.

We decided to run a  SPSeek scan on the test server which is running version 11.6 to see the results.

This scan is a non-differential  scan against the whole allstatecloud tenant at a depth of 3.

It is still running at the minute however we are seeing different errors now, screenshot below.

 

Can you advise what these errors may relate to?

Would you like to continue and have our meeting this morning or wait until this scan completes and discuss?

 

Thanks

Nuala

We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

Hi Aleksandr,

 

To answer your questions


	When did it start to happen?


We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.


	Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?


There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)

These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources. 

We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud) 


	Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?


SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)


	Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?


I have uploaded the job log to the ticket. 

 

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.

They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.

I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

 

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala

Hello, On review of the error messages it looks like the service account for Sharepoint Online doesn't have access to certain resources. When did it start to happen? Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000C53G5:ref

Hi Aleksandr,

To answer your questions

  1.  When did it start to happen?

We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.

  1.  Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?
There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)
These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources.
We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?
SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?
I have uploaded the job log to the ticket.

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.
They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.
I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

Many Thanks
Nuala

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

On review of the SP sites with Ciaran in the errors, it was noted that there are sites without access or they are Read-only.

In this case, the scope should be defined for the ""SPAA-System Scans"" job that should include the sites with access/exclude the sites without access/marked for deletion/not available.

Once you will have this scope configured please run the SPAA scan check for the Warnings/Errors and let us know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000C53G5:ref

 


Hi Alex

 

We think the issues we are seeing on the SharePoint job on our production servers may be related to the older version of StealthAudit that we currently using 11.5.

We decided to run a  SPSeek scan on the test server which is running version 11.6 to see the results.

This scan is a non-differential  scan against the whole allstatecloud tenant at a depth of 3.

It is still running at the minute however we are seeing different errors now, screenshot below.

 

Can you advise what these errors may relate to?

Would you like to continue and have our meeting this morning or wait until this scan completes and discuss?

 

Thanks

Nuala

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access.

We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages appeared ""error querying folder /sites/INV_FlowDevelopment/SiteAccess/ for files"".

Please ask your Sharepoint team if there are issues with accessing this site while the scan is running and let me know the result of the scan.
We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

Best regards,

Hello,

On review of the error messages it looks like the service account for Sharepoint Online doesn't have access to certain resources.


	When did it start to happen?
	Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?
	Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?
	Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?


Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

On review of the SP sites with Ciaran in the errors, it was noted that there are sites without access or they are Read-only.

In this case, the scope should be defined for the ""SPAA-System Scans"" job that should include the sites with access/exclude the sites without access/marked for deletion/not available.

Once you will have this scope configured please run the SPAA scan check for the Warnings/Errors and let us know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Alex

We think the issues we are seeing on the SharePoint job on our production servers may be related to the older version of StealthAudit that we currently using 11.5.
We decided to run a  SPSeek scan on the test server which is running version 11.6 to see the results.
This scan is a non-differential  scan against the whole allstatecloud tenant at a depth of 3.
It is still running at the minute however we are seeing different errors now, screenshot below.

Can you advise what these errors may relate to?
Would you like to continue and have our meeting this morning or wait until this scan completes and discuss?

Thanks
Nuala

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access.

We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages appeared ""error querying folder /sites/INV_FlowDevelopment/SiteAccess/ for files"".

Please ask your Sharepoint team if there are issues with accessing this site while the scan is running and let me know the result of the scan.
We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000C53G5:ref

Hi Aleksandr,

To answer your questions

  1.  When did it start to happen?

We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.

  1.  Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?
There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)
These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources.
We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?
SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?
I have uploaded the job log to the ticket.

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.
They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.
I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

Many Thanks
Nuala

Hi Aleksandr,

We are currently running a SP scan on our Y server. Once this is complete we will be able to run a specific scan on the sites we receive from Ciaran.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

On review of the SP sites with Ciaran in the errors, it was noted that there are sites without access or they are Read-only.

In this case, the scope should be defined for the ""SPAA-System Scans"" job that should include the sites with access/exclude the sites without access/marked for deletion/not available.

Once you will have this scope configured please run the SPAA scan check for the Warnings/Errors and let us know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Alex

 

We think the issues we are seeing on the SharePoint job on our production servers may be related to the older version of StealthAudit that we currently using 11.5.

We decided to run a  SPSeek scan on the test server which is running version 11.6 to see the results.

This scan is a non-differential  scan against the whole allstatecloud tenant at a depth of 3.

It is still running at the minute however we are seeing different errors now, screenshot below.

 

Can you advise what these errors may relate to?

Would you like to continue and have our meeting this morning or wait until this scan completes and discuss?

 

Thanks

Nuala

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access.

We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages appeared ""error querying folder /sites/INV_FlowDevelopment/SiteAccess/ for files"".

Please ask your Sharepoint team if there are issues with accessing this site while the scan is running and let me know the result of the scan.
We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

Best regards,

Hi Aleksandr,

 

To answer your questions


	When did it start to happen?


We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.


	Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?


There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)

These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources. 

We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud) 


	Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?


SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)


	Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?


I have uploaded the job log to the ticket. 

 

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.

They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.

I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

 

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala

Hi Aleksandr,
Please see attached list of sites we have scanned on the Y server. The scans, BI, Exceptions and all jobs in the job group completed.
We ran the scan on the attached sites only at a depth of 1 (see below). I believe we have run a full scan on the AllstateCloud.Sharepoint.com tenant however, is there a way we can verify this? (we have ran lots of scans).
Reason I ask is we would like to run deeper level scans on these sites but without a full scan, the differential scan would not pull back data.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

On review of the SP sites with Ciaran in the errors, it was noted that there are sites without access or they are Read-only.

In this case, the scope should be defined for the ""SPAA-System Scans"" job that should include the sites with access/exclude the sites without access/marked for deletion/not available.

Once you will have this scope configured please run the SPAA scan check for the Warnings/Errors and let us know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Alex

We think the issues we are seeing on the SharePoint job on our production servers may be related to the older version of StealthAudit that we currently using 11.5.
We decided to run a  SPSeek scan on the test server which is running version 11.6 to see the results.
This scan is a non-differential  scan against the whole allstatecloud tenant at a depth of 3.
It is still running at the minute however we are seeing different errors now, screenshot below.

Can you advise what these errors may relate to?
Would you like to continue and have our meeting this morning or wait until this scan completes and discuss?

Thanks
Nuala

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access.

We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages appeared ""error querying folder /sites/INV_FlowDevelopment/SiteAccess/ for files"".

Please ask your Sharepoint team if there are issues with accessing this site while the scan is running and let me know the result of the scan.
We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000C53G5:ref

Hi Aleksandr,

To answer your questions

  1.  When did it start to happen?

We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.

  1.  Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?
There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)
These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources.
We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?
SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?
I have uploaded the job log to the ticket.

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.
They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.
I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

Many Thanks
Nuala

If it was a full scan there's no need to verify that.

You can check the SPAA_DirectPermissions view in the SPAA-Bulk Import job to ensure that the sites are presented.

Then you can run a deep-level full scan first and only then you can run a differential scan.

In the meantime, can you check if you still have the same access errors?

Hi Aleksandr,

Please see attached list of sites we have scanned on the Y server. The scans, BI, Exceptions and all jobs in the job group completed.

We ran the scan on the attached sites only at a depth of 1 (see below). I believe we have run a full scan on the AllstateCloud.Sharepoint.com tenant however, is there a way we can verify this? (we have ran lots of scans).
Reason I ask is we would like to run deeper level scans on these sites but without a full scan, the differential scan would not pull back data.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Aleksandr,

We are currently running a SP scan on our Y server. Once this is complete we will be able to run a specific scan on the sites we receive from Ciaran.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

On review of the SP sites with Ciaran in the errors, it was noted that there are sites without access or they are Read-only.

In this case, the scope should be defined for the ""SPAA-System Scans"" job that should include the sites with access/exclude the sites without access/marked for deletion/not available.

Once you will have this scope configured please run the SPAA scan check for the Warnings/Errors and let us know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Alex

 

We think the issues we are seeing on the SharePoint job on our production servers may be related to the older version of StealthAudit that we currently using 11.5.

We decided to run a  SPSeek scan on the test server which is running version 11.6 to see the results.

This scan is a non-differential  scan against the whole allstatecloud tenant at a depth of 3.

It is still running at the minute however we are seeing different errors now, screenshot below.

 

Can you advise what these errors may relate to?

Would you like to continue and have our meeting this morning or wait until this scan completes and discuss?

 

Thanks

Nuala

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access.

We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages appeared ""error querying folder /sites/INV_FlowDevelopment/SiteAccess/ for files"".

Please ask your Sharepoint team if there are issues with accessing this site while the scan is running and let me know the result of the scan.
We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

Best regards,

Hi Aleksandr,

 

To answer your questions


	When did it start to happen?


We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.


	Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?


There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)

These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources. 

We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud) 


	Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?


SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)


	Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?


I have uploaded the job log to the ticket. 

 

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.

They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.

I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

 

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala

Hi Alison,

If it was a full scan there's no need to verify that.

You can check the SPAA_DirectPermissions view in the SPAA-Bulk Import job to ensure that the sites are presented.

Then you can run a deep-level full scan first and only then you can run a differential scan.

In the meantime, can you check if you still have the same access errors?

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Aleksandr,

Please see attached list of sites we have scanned on the Y server. The scans, BI, Exceptions and all jobs in the job group completed.

We ran the scan on the attached sites only at a depth of 1 (see below). I believe we have run a full scan on the AllstateCloud.Sharepoint.com tenant however, is there a way we can verify this? (we have ran lots of scans).
Reason I ask is we would like to run deeper level scans on these sites but without a full scan, the differential scan would not pull back data.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

On review of the SP sites with Ciaran in the errors, it was noted that there are sites without access or they are Read-only.

In this case, the scope should be defined for the ""SPAA-System Scans"" job that should include the sites with access/exclude the sites without access/marked for deletion/not available.

Once you will have this scope configured please run the SPAA scan check for the Warnings/Errors and let us know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Alex

 

We think the issues we are seeing on the SharePoint job on our production servers may be related to the older version of StealthAudit that we currently using 11.5.

We decided to run a  SPSeek scan on the test server which is running version 11.6 to see the results.

This scan is a non-differential  scan against the whole allstatecloud tenant at a depth of 3.

It is still running at the minute however we are seeing different errors now, screenshot below.

 

Can you advise what these errors may relate to?

Would you like to continue and have our meeting this morning or wait until this scan completes and discuss?

 

Thanks

Nuala

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access.

We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages appeared ""error querying folder /sites/INV_FlowDevelopment/SiteAccess/ for files"".

Please ask your Sharepoint team if there are issues with accessing this site while the scan is running and let me know the result of the scan.
We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000C53G5:ref
 


Hi Aleksandr,

 

To answer your questions


	When did it start to happen?


We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.


	Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?


There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)

These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources. 

We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud) 


	Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?


SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)


	Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?


I have uploaded the job log to the ticket. 

 

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.

They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.

I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

 

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala

Hi Alison,

If it was a full scan there's no need to verify that.

You can check the SPAA_DirectPermissions view in the SPAA-Bulk Import job to ensure that the sites are presented.

Then you can run a deep-level full scan first and only then you can run a differential scan.

In the meantime, can you check if you still have the same access errors?

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev

Hi Aleksandr,
Please see attached list of sites we have scanned on the Y server. The scans, BI, Exceptions and all jobs in the job group completed.
We ran the scan on the attached sites only at a depth of 1 (see below). I believe we have run a full scan on the AllstateCloud.Sharepoint.com tenant however, is there a way we can verify this? (we have ran lots of scans).
Reason I ask is we would like to run deeper level scans on these sites but without a full scan, the differential scan would not pull back data.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

On review of the SP sites with Ciaran in the errors, it was noted that there are sites without access or they are Read-only.

In this case, the scope should be defined for the ""SPAA-System Scans"" job that should include the sites with access/exclude the sites without access/marked for deletion/not available.

Once you will have this scope configured please run the SPAA scan check for the Warnings/Errors and let us know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Alex

We think the issues we are seeing on the SharePoint job on our production servers may be related to the older version of StealthAudit that we currently using 11.5.
We decided to run a  SPSeek scan on the test server which is running version 11.6 to see the results.
This scan is a non-differential  scan against the whole allstatecloud tenant at a depth of 3.
It is still running at the minute however we are seeing different errors now, screenshot below.

Can you advise what these errors may relate to?
Would you like to continue and have our meeting this morning or wait until this scan completes and discuss?

Thanks
Nuala

Hi Team,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We reviewed the job status and there are 12K errors related to the site access.

We reconfigured the scope and specified only one site for the test and ran the scan. Noticed 2 warning messages appeared ""error querying folder /sites/INV_FlowDevelopment/SiteAccess/ for files"".

Please ask your Sharepoint team if there are issues with accessing this site while the scan is running and let me know the result of the scan.
We will schedule another meeting with the Sharepoint team to review.

Best regards,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000C53G5:ref

Hi Aleksandr,

To answer your questions

  1.  When did it start to happen?

We are only recently seeing this happen as the SP job had not been running due to an internal remediation process that has now completed.

  1.  Is this a new set of resources in the SPAA scope or the scan is failing for already specified resources?
There are additional resources in the SPAA scope that we did not originally scan but moving forward we will be scanning (ie: Teams)
These new resources are failing however we are getting other fails for specified resources.
We are not pulling back any data for the whole tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you verify the service account has access to the resources in the error messages?
SP team has verified that the service account does have access to scan the tenant (allstate cloud)

  1.  Can you share the SPAA System Scan job logs for investigation?
I have uploaded the job log to the ticket.

I have spoken to the SP team who have looked at the error messages , they informed me that we are able to connect to the tenant and can hit the site but have issues with the site assets. They believed that you may be able to help resolve the issue upon investigation as they don’t know why we are getting these errors.
They had also provided me with 2 specific sites to test against but both showed offline in Stealthaudit which SP team say are not offline.
I plan to talk again with the SP team today and I am currently rerunning the job.

Can we please schedule a call to discuss these issues.

Many Thanks
Nuala
