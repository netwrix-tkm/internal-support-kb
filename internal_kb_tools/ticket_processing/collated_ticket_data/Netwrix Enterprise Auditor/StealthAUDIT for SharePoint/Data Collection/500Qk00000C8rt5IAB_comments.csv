@Salesforce just to let you know, we are onboarding a number of new devs and QAs into the team. As such, tickets like this will be rejected going forward, as it does not provide anywhere near enough information. Please assume this is being picked up by our newest developer and not Rob. Thanks

@Salesforce @Helen Randall @Robert Minichino - Hey Devon, 

Were you able to confirm in the logs whether the SPAA system scan is still ""resuming"" or if it started over? The same HF for the SPAC BI issue contained a fix for the pause/resume issue. The longer scan time may be expected based on it now starting over.

	 - 	this HF is a stopgap measure to get their scans to complete while we do further investigation of the performance issues 
	 - 	when you get on to implement this HF 

	 - 	Stop the running SPAA scan 
	 - 	drop in the HF 
	 - 	Add the new ""<DisableActivityResourceManager>true</DisableActivityResourceManager>"" setting to the job xmls for ALL SPAA and SPAC scan and bulk import jobs (see ""new_xmlsetting.png"" on the SP site) 
	 - 	kick the SPAA scan off again

@Ethan Israel @Helen Randall @Salesforce Hi Nick,
The development team reviewed the job's configuration and identified that the issue is likely due to the 'DISABLEACTIVITYRESOURCEMANAGER' setting. It should be 'true' instead of 'TRUE,' as XML is case-sensitive. Could we please update this setting in the customer's environment?

@Salesforce @Helen Randall - Dev investigated the missing groups issue and it looks like the issue here is the scoping they have configured on the Effective Access Report in the AIC. They have ""No nesting"" applied in the scope (see ""nesting scope.png"" attached in SP). Please have them adjust the nesting scope and try again. 

The fact that those trustees are showing null in T2 seems to be a red herring. We keep minimum membership details for the trustees in the tier 2 database. For reports, we get this detailed information from Entra ID Inventory.

If they're still not seeing the expected data after adjusting the nesting scope, please ask them to verify the membership chain by executing queries for the missing group(s) on the following views and share the results with us,

[dbo].[SA_AzureADInventory_GroupMembersView]

We confirmed with the customer on the call today that it seems in AIC that none of the SharePoint groups showing with permissions to site have any group membership found (listed to the right of AIC as can be seen in attached screenshot today). The customer knows those SharePoint groups have members though. This seems related to the problem going on here. It almost appears that we have lost the ability to see members of these SharePoint groups in their environment. This used to work fine in the past. If nothing was found on the investigation last week, is this one possible to bring onto the current sprint starting this week?

With that hotfix, the need for the extra XML tags that were added to SPAA/SPAC scan and Bulk import Jobs can be safely removed (or set to false). These tags were:

	 - 	<DisableActivityResourceManager>
	 - 	<DisableActivityEventResourceUpdates>


Dev advises that we disable each of these settings one at a time, in the event that something goes wrong, we can triage that specific area.

@Salesforce - Hey Nick, 

Just to be clear, there are a few different issues all lumped into this one escalation ticket. The foreign key constraint on bulk import fix has not been on the backlog, that one has been active as the top priority on the dev sprint throughout. That fix required extensive dev work and is now with QA. 

 The ticket for investigating the latest issues with the performance of the Activity Resource Resolution step is what was on the backlog and has now been pulled onto the sprint.

Can we get scan and bulk import job logs from SP jobs running concurrently with the last log?
That would be jobs that overlapped with the time period Nov 11 2024 11:23:00 to Nov 12 19:25:16.

I'm not seeing what we need. In that zip, there are 3 logs. The 1st is a log we already have, the 2nd and 3rd logs are from Nov 7. They are all SPAA.

What about other SharePoint jobs like SPAC?

Alright since we do not have a SPAC scan and import log from the same time period, could we get the latest SPAC import log and the scan log that goes with it?

@Chris Brooks @Michael Burrofato @Helen Randall @Salesforce

It looks like their SPAC bulk imports still have the <DisableActivityResourceManager> setting set to true, but their SPAA scans have the setting set to false.
They should always be the same.
One issue that is happening right now is SPAC imports are importing new data that needs to be resolved, but since the setting is turned off, they will never be resolved.
That means every SPAA/SPSEEK scan will have more and more data to look up/add during the slow ActivityResourceManager step.

Turning that setting to false for SPAC BI will cause activity data that was previously added to get resolved, thus requiring fewer lookups / inserts at the start of the next SPAA scan.

Since after the SPAA adjustment it continued to take days to run. We never took the next step to remove from SPAC.

Now both are disabled. And we will see what happens. They have a second ticket for SPAA import foreign key constraint that is escalated so not sure if we will get some good runs in now or not.

@Salesforce @Helen Randall - dev took a look at this and the guidance is to leave the scan running, there's no reason to cancel it if it's still mapping trustees. 

This long-running trustee mapping step should just be a one-time cost due to the initial migrating a huge amount of trustees. However, we will investigate the provided logs to see if there are any bugs present contributing to the slowness or if there's anything we can improve to get this to complete more quickly.

Running level 2 scan right now.

1. can we figure out a better way or option for a better count?  This is the most recent in the log, but the numbers don't make sense lol. At the very least if we have a way on the side to attempt to calculate or if the scan would keep these numbers accurate would be nice.

2.Over time we have seen it take much longer to process files. Is this expected?  I don't see any significant change in system or network resources.


Included the logs but here are a few snippets.
early on in scan  - 23/03/2025 08:16:05 - 23/03/2025 08:16:06 was about 60 lines in the log
about half way through 24/03/2025 05:13:50 - 24/03/2025 05:13:50	 roughly the same pace  60 lines.

Then around here the gap starts  or scanning starts to slow.
27/03/2025 00:16:16 - 27/03/2025 00:18:13  so about 2 minutes for 60 lines.

Currently still scanning. the gap is quite a bit more.
