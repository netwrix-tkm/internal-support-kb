They were using version 11.6 of the application.

Cause: The issue was caused by the SPSEEK scan being scoped to a single SharePoint site, which prevented other sites from being included in the audit. Additionally, the SPAA scan had been disabled for a long time due to an expired certificate, and the database contained outdated or incomplete data.

Resolution: 
1. A new self-signed certificate was created and uploaded to the Azure App registration. The connection profile in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor was updated to use the new certificate.
2. The inclusion filter for the SPSEEK scan was removed to ensure all sites were scanned.
3. All existing SPSEEK and SPAA data were dropped from the SQL database, and the local copy was renamed to start with a clean slate.
4. A fresh SPSEEK scan was run, initially with a depth of 2 levels, and later increased to 4 levels. The scan successfully updated the missing sites in the AIC.
5. The customer was advised to increase the scan depth further by unchecking the ""Limit scanned depth to:"" option for a complete scan.
6. The logging level was reduced to ""Warning"" to prevent log bloat and memory resource errors during subsequent scans.
7. The customer confirmed that the sites were now visible in the AIC, resolving the primary issue. However, a separate ticket was created to address inconsistencies in user account reporting across Active Directory and Entra ID.
