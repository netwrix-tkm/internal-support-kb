@Michael Rubacky @Helen Randall @Michael Burrofato @Chris Brooks @Salesforce - dev will need to do some further investigating into the root cause for the FK Constraint errors we've been seeing recently on sharepoint bulk imports. 

However, as a workaround to get this customer back up and running, we recommend resetting the USN value for that host to 0 in the SA_SPAA_Hosts table in T1  and then running the bulk import again (just like we did with mainehealth last week). Please give that a try and let us know if there are any further issues, while we continue to look into the root cause.

@Salesforce the further investigation for this should commence next week. Any updates on whether the workaround was successful?
