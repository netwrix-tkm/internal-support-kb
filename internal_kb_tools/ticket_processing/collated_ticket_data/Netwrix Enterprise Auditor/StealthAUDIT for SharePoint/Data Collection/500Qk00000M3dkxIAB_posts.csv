Customer is on 11.6.0.76. 
They are concerned about SharePoint Online SEEK system scan job performance.

Customer has 3799 SharePoint Online sites to scan. 
To lower the SEEK scan processing time they started scanning sites in batches (by running SDD scan against 10-15 sites at once) but at some point SDD scan started to take an abnormally long amounts of time event for a single site. 
At the moment they are scanning a single site with 1 level depth. 

Currently they are running SDD scan with these settings:
a Vitality_goinGymForBank site is selected for processing. 
don`t process files larger than 10 mb 
7 concurrent SDD threads 
Scan typical documents only 
Store discovered sensitive data is enabled. 
Site depth - 1 site 
SDD module is running locally on Stealth Audit server. 
around 32 Sensitive data criteria 
agent service scan is disabled. 


This last SEEK Job was started at 08 AM on 03.03.2025, and then the job got stuck at 13:37 03.03.2025 - ""DLP finished"" was the last line in the logs. 
But the job is still visible in console as ""running"". 
Job was started via schedule. 

We took memory dump of the NEA console, memory dump of the StealthAudit Job process and also collected debug logs from SADatabase folder and export the SEEK scan job logs. 

We killed the job process which made the last job run appear as ""Success"" in the console. 
After this we started bulk import job - bulk import was still running when I left meeting. 

We agreed with customer that once bulk import has finished, they will test SEEK scan with these settings to see if the SEEK job gets stuck again:
don`t process files larger than 2 mb 
Only 2 concurrent SDD threads 

In the meantime, support will escalate this issue to RnD.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-03-04T11:18:42.000Z"

Customer performed scan from server that is outside of DMZ, scan was completed within 15 minutes.

This suggests the issue with infrastructure, since troubled server is in DMZ.

Customer then moved both servers in DMZ and applied same FW rules, troubled server still shows same issue, new test server is still finishing job within 15 minutes.

We've advised customer to consult with their Network team to determine the issue, but customer still asked for our assistance.","","","","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2025-05-30T14:27:24.000Z"
