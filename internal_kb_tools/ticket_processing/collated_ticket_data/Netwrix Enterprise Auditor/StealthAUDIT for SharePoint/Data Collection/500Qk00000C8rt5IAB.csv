"500Qk00000C8rt5IAB","00412647","Support Ticket","SPAA - missing perms","This ticket covered several  issues.
Ultimately the last one we were determined to fix was an import issue.
New CU was created to create a new table in the database for Trustees.
We have passed that table on a 0 level and a level 2 scan at this time.","","SPAA Level 2 scan is taking AWHILE. Told Brittany to rerun the level 2 before running level 3 to get a better idea of time with differential on.

Since this is past the Create Trustees table should we have a problem post scan we will open a fresh ticket for that.","SPAA Bulk Import was successful at low levels, running deeper system scan and bulk import to verify all is good.

R&D reviewing logs to confirm pace and everything looks good in the log running SPAA scan.","Hotfix released for this was implemented
