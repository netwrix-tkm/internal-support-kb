It’s been setting on this screen for 45 minutes:
The Job Locking the database is “SP_StaleUsers”.. it ran for 5 hours and 33 minutes and I believe locked the database the entire time.
 


 

It happened last week too, but I didn’t find it until late Thursday and I had to bounce the server to get StealthAudit reset.   This job should not be preventing any other StealthAudit Activity, something’s broke and they should add fixing this a part of the upcoming Sprint.","","","","Symptom:
