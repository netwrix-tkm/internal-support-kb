Could you please also include similar xml file but for SP_DropTables job? From both servers if possible.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Damir,
Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files.
JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).
JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.
Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is:

Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:

Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Brandon,
Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

Thank you,

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed



Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |









Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.

2. [cid:image006.png@01DB2ED0.1ADF5200]

Hi Damir,

Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files. 

JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).

JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.

Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is: 



 

 

Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:



Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Brandon,

Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan  ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed 


Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |


 


 


 


 


Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize


Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. 

2. 

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Thank you,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed 


Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |



 



 



 



 


Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize


Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. 

2. 

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Thank you,

Brandon West

Hi Damir,
Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files.
JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).
JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.
Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is:

Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:
[cid:image002.png@01DB2F6C.385F6170]
Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Brandon,
Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Damir,
Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files.
JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).
JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed



Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |



























Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. [cid:image005.png@01DB2F6C.629AFEE0]

2. [cid:image006.png@01DB2F6C.629AFEE0]

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Thank you,

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed 


Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. 

2. 

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Thank you,

Hi Alison, I am following up with development team.

I assume that you've used SP_DropTables from A0185-APP2357-S? Is that correct?

Hi Damir,
Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files.
JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).
JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.
Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is:
[cid:image001.png@01DB2F8C.C3FC7270]


Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:
[cid:image002.png@01DB2F8C.C3FC7270]
Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Brandon,
Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed



Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |

















































































Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. [cid:image005.png@01DB2F8C.C3FC7270]

2. [cid:image006.png@01DB2F8C.C3FC7270]

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Hi Damir,

Yes I believe it would be. Is there any particular reason why? Is it not better that all servers are at the highest level available?

 

Thank you,

Hi Damir,

Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files. 

JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).

JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.

Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is: 



 

 

Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:



Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Brandon,

Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan  ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed 


Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. 

2. 

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Damir is absolutely on the right track here.  I just want to call out one specific point I missed earlier about the SPDropTables job.

By default, when you import the job all the analyses are disable to prevent unintentional dropping of data.  There is a warning when you first import the job in big red letters so I'm sure you didn't miss it.  But, would you confirm that you did enable all of the analyses before running SPDropTables?

Hi Alsion, another question, would it be possible to upgrade POC server to 11.6.0.113? So they're both on the same version? If you need my assistance, you can book a meeting with me.

Hi Alison, I am following up with development team.

I assume that you've used SP_DropTables from A0185-APP2357-S? Is that correct?

Hi Damir,

Job _SP_DropTables.XML is from A0775-APP2357-S and Job _SP_DropTables_Y.XML is from Y0185-APP0443-S.

I have also attached them to the ticket.

 

 

Thank you,

Hi Alison, thank you, I am not sure why you have discrepancy in the build versions, I can make an assumption that newer version has a hotfix for one of the issues you were trying to address, but I cannot tell for sure. Could you please also

Hi Alison, thank you, I am not sure why you have discrepancy in the build versions, I can make an assumption that newer version has a hotfix for one of the issues you were trying to address, but I cannot tell for sure.

Could you please also include similar xml file but for SP_DropTables job? From both servers if possible.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Damir,

Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files. 

JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).

JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.

Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is: 



 

 

Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:



Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Brandon,

Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan  ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed 


Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. 

2. 

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Thank you,

Hi Alison, I am following up with development team.

I assume that you've used SP_DropTables from A0185-APP2357-S? Is that correct?

Hi Damir,
Job _SP_DropTables.XML is from A0775-APP2357-S and Job _SP_DropTables_Y.XML is from Y0185-APP0443-S.
I have also attached them to the ticket.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HfJL3:ref

Hi Damir,
Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files.
JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).
JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.
Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is:
[cid:image001.png@01DB342A.0AC07F20]


Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:
[cid:image002.png@01DB342A.0AC07F20]
Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Brandon,
Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed



Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |



















































































































































































































































Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. [cid:image005.png@01DB342A.0AC07F20]

2. [cid:image006.png@01DB342A.0AC07F20]

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Thank you,

As for your question for applying license when job is running it is not possible without interrupting the job, so to apply new license file you would need wait until job is completed or stop it and then to apply new license, you can refer this article to do that:

Hi Damir,

I have scheduled the upgrade for Wednesday 9am UK time. We are running a level 3 SPSEEK scan atm but we have a meeting with Netwrix this afternoon. If the current scan is cancelled I will reach out to you and we can reschedule the meeting for tomorrow.

 

Thank you,

Hi Alison, I am following up with development team.

I assume that you've used SP_DropTables from A0185-APP2357-S? Is that correct?

Hi Damir,

Job _SP_DropTables.XML is from A0775-APP2357-S and Job _SP_DropTables_Y.XML is from Y0185-APP0443-S.

I have also attached them to the ticket.

 

 

Thank you,

Hi Alison, thank you, I am not sure why you have discrepancy in the build versions, I can make an assumption that newer version has a hotfix for one of the issues you were trying to address, but I cannot tell for sure. Could you please also

Hi Alison, thank you, I am not sure why you have discrepancy in the build versions, I can make an assumption that newer version has a hotfix for one of the issues you were trying to address, but I cannot tell for sure.

Could you please also include similar xml file but for SP_DropTables job? From both servers if possible.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Damir,

Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files. 

JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).

JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.

Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is: 



 

 

Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:



Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Brandon,

Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan  ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. 

2. 

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

HI Allison,

Damir is absolutely on the right track here.  I just want to call out one specific point I missed earlier about the SPDropTables job.

By default, when you import the job all the analyses are disable to prevent unintentional dropping of data.  There is a warning when you first import the job in big red letters so I'm sure you didn't miss it.  But, would you confirm that you did enable all of the analyses before running SPDropTables?

Hi Alison, yes it would be even better to get both servers on latest version, which is 11.6.0.117.

I was suggesting to upgrade POC server to 11.6.0.113, because A0185-APP2357-S already has 11.6.0.113 installed, so I thought it would be less requests for you.

But yes, please upgrade to 11.6.0.117, if you need my assistance, please book a meeting with me using following link:

Hi Alison, I am following up with development team.

I assume that you've used SP_DropTables from A0185-APP2357-S? Is that correct?

Hi Damir,
Job _SP_DropTables.XML is from A0775-APP2357-S and Job _SP_DropTables_Y.XML is from Y0185-APP0443-S.
I have also attached them to the ticket.


Thank you,

Hi Alison, thank you, I am not sure why you have discrepancy in the build versions, I can make an assumption that newer version has a hotfix for one of the issues you were trying to address, but I cannot tell for sure. Could you please also

Could you please also include similar xml file but for SP_DropTables job? From both servers if possible.

Thanks in advance.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HfJL3:ref

Hi Damir,
Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files.
JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).
JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.
Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is:
[cid:image002.png@01DB351F.3062C800]


Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:
[cid:image003.png@01DB351F.3062C800]
Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Brandon,
Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed



Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |



































































































































































Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. [cid:image006.png@01DB351F.3062C800]

2. [cid:image007.png@01DB351F.3062C800]

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Thank you,

HI Allison,

Damir is absolutely on the right track here.  I just want to call out one specific point I missed earlier about the SPDropTables job.

By default, when you import the job all the analyses are disable to prevent unintentional dropping of data.  There is a warning when you first import the job in big red letters so I'm sure you didn't miss it.  But, would you confirm that you did enable all of the analyses before running SPDropTables?

Hi Alison, yes it would be even better to get both servers on latest version, which is 11.6.0.117.

I was suggesting to upgrade POC server to 11.6.0.113, because A0185-APP2357-S already has 11.6.0.113 installed, so I thought it would be less requests for you.

But yes, please upgrade to 11.6.0.117, if you need my assistance, please book a meeting with me using following link:

Yes I believe it would be. Is there any particular reason why? Is it not better that all servers are at the highest level available?

Hi Alison, I am following up with development team.

I assume that you've used SP_DropTables from A0185-APP2357-S? Is that correct?

Hi Damir,

Job _SP_DropTables.XML is from A0775-APP2357-S and Job _SP_DropTables_Y.XML is from Y0185-APP0443-S.

I have also attached them to the ticket.

 

 

Thank you,

Hi Alison, thank you, I am not sure why you have discrepancy in the build versions, I can make an assumption that newer version has a hotfix for one of the issues you were trying to address, but I cannot tell for sure. Could you please also

Hi Alison, thank you, I am not sure why you have discrepancy in the build versions, I can make an assumption that newer version has a hotfix for one of the issues you were trying to address, but I cannot tell for sure.

Could you please also include similar xml file but for SP_DropTables job? From both servers if possible.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Damir,

Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files. 

JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).

JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.

Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is: 



 

 

Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:



Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Brandon,

Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan  ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. 

2. 

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Hi Damir,
On Nov 14, on Y0185-APP0443-S we commenced a level 3 SPSEEK scan on 20 SP sites. This scan and all SP jobs in the SharePoint job group completed successfully on Nov 16. This morning we have commenced a level 4 SPSEEK scan on the same 20 SP sites.

On Oct 30, on A0775-APP2357-S we had commenced a level 4 SPAA scan on all the SharePoint sites (~4720 SP sites). This scan errored with multiple msgs (most being SharePoint Rest Service exception msgs). We bulk imported the scan on Oct 31 which failed and we then ran the BI on Nov 4 which was successful. We have now commenced a level 4 SPAA scan on one site, https://allstatecloud.sharepoint.com/sites/HRWorkforceInsights on A0775-APP2357-S to see if we still get a SharePoint Rest Service exception error.

@Sloan, Nuala<mailto:Nuala.Sloan1@allstate.com> please keep us posted with the scan results.

Thank you

HI Allison,

Damir is absolutely on the right track here.  I just want to call out one specific point I missed earlier about the SPDropTables job.

By default, when you import the job all the analyses are disable to prevent unintentional dropping of data.  There is a warning when you first import the job in big red letters so I'm sure you didn't miss it.  But, would you confirm that you did enable all of the analyses before running SPDropTables?

Hi Alison, yes it would be even better to get both servers on latest version, which is 11.6.0.117.

I was suggesting to upgrade POC server to 11.6.0.113, because A0185-APP2357-S already has 11.6.0.113 installed, so I thought it would be less requests for you.

But yes, please upgrade to 11.6.0.117, if you need my assistance, please book a meeting with me using following link:

Hi Alsion, another question, would it be possible to upgrade POC server to 11.6.0.113? So they're both on the same version? If you need my assistance, you can book a meeting with me.

Hi Alison, I am following up with development team.

I assume that you've used SP_DropTables from A0185-APP2357-S? Is that correct?

Hi Damir,
Job _SP_DropTables.XML is from A0775-APP2357-S and Job _SP_DropTables_Y.XML is from Y0185-APP0443-S.
I have also attached them to the ticket.

Hi Damir,
Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files.
JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).
JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.
Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is:
[cid:image002.png@01DB39B0.41FEB340]


Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:
[cid:image003.png@01DB39B0.41FEB340]
Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Brandon,
Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed



Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |









































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. [cid:image006.png@01DB39B0.41FEB340]

2. [cid:image007.png@01DB39B0.41FEB340]

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Thank you,

Hi Damir,

The SP scan we were running on A0775-APP2357-S against one site has completed with the rest service exception error.

C:25] Error during connection for Resource(SiteCollection|947|HR - Workforce Insights) Error:SharePoint Rest service exception

We are now kicking off a full SP scan on A0775-APP2357-S at level 4. We will update you once the scan has completed.

Many Thanks

Hi Damir,
On Nov 14, on Y0185-APP0443-S we commenced a level 3 SPSEEK scan on 20 SP sites. This scan and all SP jobs in the SharePoint job group completed successfully on Nov 16. This morning we have commenced a level 4 SPSEEK scan on the same 20 SP sites.

On Oct 30, on A0775-APP2357-S we had commenced a level 4 SPAA scan on all the SharePoint sites (~4720 SP sites). This scan errored with multiple msgs (most being SharePoint Rest Service exception msgs). We bulk imported the scan on Oct 31 which failed and we then ran the BI on Nov 4 which was successful. We have now commenced a level 4 SPAA scan on one site, https://allstatecloud.sharepoint.com/sites/HRWorkforceInsights on A0775-APP2357-S to see if we still get a SharePoint Rest Service exception error.

@Sloan, Nuala<mailto:Nuala.Sloan1@allstate.com> please keep us posted with the scan results.

HI Allison,

Damir is absolutely on the right track here.  I just want to call out one specific point I missed earlier about the SPDropTables job.

By default, when you import the job all the analyses are disable to prevent unintentional dropping of data.  There is a warning when you first import the job in big red letters so I'm sure you didn't miss it.  But, would you confirm that you did enable all of the analyses before running SPDropTables?

Hi Alison, yes it would be even better to get both servers on latest version, which is 11.6.0.117.

I was suggesting to upgrade POC server to 11.6.0.113, because A0185-APP2357-S already has 11.6.0.113 installed, so I thought it would be less requests for you.

But yes, please upgrade to 11.6.0.117, if you need my assistance, please book a meeting with me using following link:

Hi Damir,
Yes I believe it would be. Is there any particular reason why? Is it not better that all servers are at the highest level available?

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Alison, I am following up with development team.

I assume that you've used SP_DropTables from A0185-APP2357-S? Is that correct?

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HfJL3:ref

Hi Damir,
Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files.
JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).
JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.
Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is:
[cid:image002.png@01DB39DB.8B910640]


Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:
[cid:image003.png@01DB39DB.8B910640]
Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Brandon,
Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi team,

As of October 8th I show that you have deployed NEA 11.6.0.72. Is this still the correct version for both consoles? This Powershell will verify what is currently installed



Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |









































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. [cid:image006.png@01DB39DB.8B910640]

2. [cid:image007.png@01DB39DB.8B910640]

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Thank you,

Hi Damir, 

 

The SP scan we were running on A0775-APP2357-S against one site has completed with the rest service exception error. 

 

C:25] Error during connection for Resource(SiteCollection|947|HR - Workforce Insights) Error:SharePoint Rest service exception

 

We are now kicking off a full SP scan on A0775-APP2357-S at level 4. We will update you once the scan has completed.

 

Many Thanks

Nuala

Hi Damir,

On Nov 14, on Y0185-APP0443-S we commenced a level 3 SPSEEK scan on 20 SP sites. This scan and all SP jobs in the SharePoint job group completed successfully on Nov 16. This morning we have commenced a level 4 SPSEEK scan on the same 20 SP sites.

 

On Oct 30, on A0775-APP2357-S we had commenced a level 4 SPAA scan on all the SharePoint sites (~4720 SP sites). This scan errored with multiple msgs (most being SharePoint Rest Service exception msgs). We bulk imported the scan on Oct 31 which failed and we then ran the BI on Nov 4 which was successful. We have now commenced a level 4 SPAA scan on one site, https://allstatecloud.sharepoint.com/sites/HRWorkforceInsights on A0775-APP2357-S to see if we still get a SharePoint Rest Service exception error.

 

@Sloan, Nuala please keep us posted with the scan results.

 

Thank you

Hi Brandon,

Yes, I did enable all of the analyses before running SPDropTables.

HI Allison,

Damir is absolutely on the right track here.  I just want to call out one specific point I missed earlier about the SPDropTables job.

By default, when you import the job all the analyses are disable to prevent unintentional dropping of data.  There is a warning when you first import the job in big red letters so I'm sure you didn't miss it.  But, would you confirm that you did enable all of the analyses before running SPDropTables?



Thank you,

Hi Alison, yes it would be even better to get both servers on latest version, which is 11.6.0.117.

I was suggesting to upgrade POC server to 11.6.0.113, because A0185-APP2357-S already has 11.6.0.113 installed, so I thought it would be less requests for you.

But yes, please upgrade to 11.6.0.117, if you need my assistance, please book a meeting with me using following link:

Hi Damir,

Yes I believe it would be. Is there any particular reason why? Is it not better that all servers are at the highest level available?

Hi Alison, I am following up with development team.

I assume that you've used SP_DropTables from A0185-APP2357-S? Is that correct?

Hi Damir,

Job _SP_DropTables.XML is from A0775-APP2357-S and Job _SP_DropTables_Y.XML is from Y0185-APP0443-S.

I have also attached them to the ticket.

Hi Alison, thank you, I am not sure why you have discrepancy in the build versions, I can make an assumption that newer version has a hotfix for one of the issues you were trying to address, but I cannot tell for sure. Could you please also

Hi Damir,

Please see attached the Bulk Import and SystemScan.xml files. 

JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (we are running an SDD POC on this server).

JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.

Build version on Y0185-APP0443-S is: 



 

 

Build version on A0185-APP2357-S is:



Do you know why we have a discrepancy in the build versions? As far as we are concerned we should have all our servers at the same build on v11.6.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Brandon,

Yes, we did import a new version of the SP_DropTables job and we have ran it. We also ensured there were no SPAA.DB3 files in the SA_CommonData folder and we then recommenced the SPAA scan (the SPAA scan, not the SPSEEK scan  ðŸ˜Š). The job logs and message logs have been attached to the ticket in the Netwrix portal.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of MS-SQL before attempting to re-import any data.
Please import the latest version of the SP_DropTables job from Instant Jobs and run it. The existing job may be renamed or removed.
1. 

2. 

This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  attempt to re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

Ticket Number: 00425496
Ticket Subject: POC - SharePoint Job- Error on Bulk Import on A0775-APP2357-S and Y0185-APP0443-S
Ticket Details: On running the SP Bulk Import Job we are encountering the following error :
We are seeing this error on both Y443 Dev server and on Production.
(similar to a previous Ticket 370928)

[C:23] Unable to perform bulk import Error: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY SAME TABLE constraint ""FK_SA_SPAA_Resources_ParentId"". The conflict occurred in database ""J4D_STEALTHAUDIT_AEM_SP"", table ""dbo.SA_SPAA_Resources"".
The statement has been terminated.

We planned to drop the SP tables and then rerun the scan and Bulk Import on the Production server.
However we are unable to drop the tables on the Production server - see attachment

Thank you!
