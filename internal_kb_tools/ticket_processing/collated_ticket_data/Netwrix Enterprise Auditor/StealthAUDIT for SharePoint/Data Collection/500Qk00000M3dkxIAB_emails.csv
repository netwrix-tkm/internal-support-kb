Hi Dhamir

We did not interrupt the previous job , can we perhaps get onto a call and run this next job accordingly to avoid any potential issues with the logs.

Please bare in mind that we need to get answer as to what the cause could be rather urgently.

2. Sensitive data logs - default location is C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSensitiveDatalogs

Additionally, I've noticed issues with disk on system level, it looks like it happens every evening at 22:30-22:50, please investigate that issue as potentially it could be a root cause.

There was another issue with VSS service having a major delay around 30000 ms which could also indicate issues with infrastructure, I would suggest to check with IT Security team to double check if EPP - Symantec is interfering.

On meeting, I've noticed issues on system level, related to disk and since this issue occurs in the same timeframe I've suggested checking with IT security team to check if end point protection runs scans during that timeframe. This comment could be found in my summary from March 19, 2025.

Could you please advise if you've got any feedback from IT security team or from infrastructure team, on what could occur on daily basis on application server? And could this event interfere with our scan?

Those events could be looked up in Windows Event Viewer in System and in Application logs.
