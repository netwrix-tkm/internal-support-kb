@Salesforce @Chris Brooks @Ethan Israel  @Matthew Finnegan The screenshot provided shows the SP_DropTables job is also throwing a FK. This usually happens when running an older version of the analysis.

Considering that the SP_DropTables job was not successful, we have to ensure that data gets successfully cleared out of tier 1 before attempting to re-import any data.
Can we have the customer run the latest available version of the SP_DropTables job? This should resolve the FK issue for the SP_DropTables job and allow tier 1 to be cleared out. If the SP_DropTables job successfully runs,  have them re-run bulk import.

If FK issue continues, please provided updated logs, including the job for SP_DropTables.

@Salesforce Additional note, to ensure that you have the latest available version of the SP_DropTables job, please re-import the job from instant solutions. 

If the issue is still occurring, providing the job xml and the build number installed used will also help us in determining if they are using the latest

To add some context, maybe that's important, they have 2 servers to run Sharepoint related scans.

JOB_1-SPSEEK_SystemScans.xml and JOB_4-SPSEEK_BulkImport.xml are on the Y0185-APP0443-S server (they are running an SDD POC on this server).

JOB_2-SPAA_SystemScans.xml and JOB_5-SPAA_BulkImport.xml are from the A0185-APP2357-S server.

Build 11.6.0.72 on Y0185-APP0443-S

Build 11.6.0.113 on A0185-APP2357-S 

Job .xml from both servers uploaded to SP.

I've suggested to upgrade Y0185-APP0443-S to 11.6.0.113, waiting for customer to book a meeting.","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2024-11-05T06:34:02.000Z","2024-11-05T06:34:02.000Z","false","false"

@Ethan Israel @Michael Burrofato @Chris Brooks  @Salesforce Upgrading both servers to be on the same versions which was suggested in the comments is a good idea. Also, when running the drop tables job ensure all of the analyses are checked.
