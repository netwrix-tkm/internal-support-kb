We are seeing this error on both Y443 Dev server and on Production. 
(similar to a previous Ticket 370928) 

[C:23] Unable to perform bulk import Error: The MERGE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY SAME TABLE constraint ""FK_SA_SPAA_Resources_ParentId"". The conflict occurred in database ""J4D_STEALTHAUDIT_AEM_SP"", table ""dbo.SA_SPAA_Resources"".
The statement has been terminated.

We planned to drop the SP tables and then rerun the scan and Bulk Import on the Production server.
However we are unable to drop the tables on the Production server - see attachment","Couldn't reproduce","Level 3 scan against 20 sites completed successfully. Customer initaited scan to 4 levels on 20 sites.

Allstate recognizes one reason for this is the dev environment is not performance provisioned as well as PROD.. But still, its long for only 400 sites.","Stop the level 3 scan --> apply the new license --> reduce scope from 400 to 20 sites in order to get Level 3 scan complete in reasonable time. 

we will be able to bring in partial data via bulk import from existing scan into the new scan and see if there are any results to look at.","Cause
Root Cause Unknown
Allstate recognized one reason for this is the dev environment is not performance provisioned as well as PROD
