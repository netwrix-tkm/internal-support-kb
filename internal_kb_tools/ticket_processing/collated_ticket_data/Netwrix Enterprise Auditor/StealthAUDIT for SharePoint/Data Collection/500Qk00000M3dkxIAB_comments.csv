@Michael Burrofato @Chris Brooks @Salesforce@WaitingOnEngineer
In the job log there is a large period of time where nothing is getting logged before the scan aborts due to lack of progress. The job log does not have a clear indicator as to why the job is hanging. Please provide SDD logs that correspond to the job log provided.

I do not see the harm in letting the job run. If we truely are not making progress NEA will abort the job. In order to troubleshoot this issue the logs requested in the previous comment would be helpful. They can be found in the SensitiveDatalogs folder.

Still waiting on artifacts requested to further investigate issue. 

As a possible workaround they could try checking ""Limit maximum number of Probable Owners per resource"" and set a reasonable value in the checkbox. 
This setting is found in the SPAA DC wizard. If scans finish in a reasonable amount of time, that would tell us if the Probable Owners calculation is causing the large delay after the scan finishes but before the job finishes

Looks like an infrastructure issue to me, but if we can point them in the right direction, it would be something they can work with.

Waiting on customer to provide packet capture.","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2025-05-21T12:41:34.000Z","2025-05-21T12:41:34.000Z","false","false"

@Salesforce Thank you for keeping us up to date on this one. I'll discuss with the team about the potential root cause for the customer.

Customer is asking for a meeting to compare both servers, but I am not sure which area should I investigate on those servers, since required ports were checked previously.

To my understanding, we need to trace the connection to SPO and see if we're hitting any bumps.

Is it worth having a call with a developer to troubleshoot the issue at this point?","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2025-05-22T08:19:43.000Z","2025-05-22T08:19:43.000Z","false","false"

""We changed the POC server ip and moved it to the same subnet  as the DMZ server.

 

The scan runs just as fast as it did previously , however our 2nd test scan got stuck at some point and we found that it was stuck in what looks like a loop where it was “checkpointing” , we stop the scan and ran it again , it continued from where it stopped and finished of in 7 minutes.

 

We than ran a 3rd test scan and it finished in 8 minutes.""


I suggest reviewing this issue with developer on call if that's possible, it's an urgent issue for customer.","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2025-05-30T09:00:52.000Z","2025-05-30T09:00:52.000Z","false","false"
