Hello Support,

Post upgrade from 11.6.0.112 to 11.6.0.127 SPO bulk import jobs are failing on SQL related error it appears. I've looked at error and event logs on the SQL server and we are not seeing any dropping of connections on SQL side. Nothing seems to line up with the bulk import errors on SQL server.

Attached bulk import job logs which were in DEBUG mode.

Current Versions:
Netwrix Access Information Center11.6.0.32
Netwrix Activity Monitor7.1.241
Netwrix Activity Monitor Agent 64-bit7.1.241
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor V11.611.6.0.127
Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On V11.611.6.0.15

Thank you,
Justin.","","","","After customer checke SQL server.
