The SP_TrusteeAudit scan for SharePoint Online is causing the tempDB on our SQL Server to fill up rapidly. Please see the attached screenshots for details.

The scan executes a large SELECT INTO operation, creating and populating multiple temp tables such as #SIDFilter and SA_SP_TrusteeAudit_DirectPermissions. It pulls data from views including:

SA_ADInventory_UsersView
SA_ADInventory_GroupsView
SA_SPAA_DirectPermissionsView
SA_SPAA_SiteCollectionsTraversalView

During a test run, the scan consumed over 100 GB of tempDB in just 27 minutes. I've attached screenshots for your reference.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-04T17:35:04.000Z"

----------
The issue appears to be the size of the Sharepoint environment uses the full space when running analysis jobs. The query is selecting so much information to run the analysis that it causes the DB to fill completely.","","","","005Qk000002AJWTIA4","2025-04-14T14:05:25.000Z"
