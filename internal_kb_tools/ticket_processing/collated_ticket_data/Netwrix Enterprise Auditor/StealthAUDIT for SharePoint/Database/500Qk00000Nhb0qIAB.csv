The SP_TrusteeAudit scan for SharePoint Online is causing the tempDB on our SQL Server to fill up rapidly. Please see the attached screenshots for details.

The scan executes a large SELECT INTO operation, creating and populating multiple temp tables such as #SIDFilter and SA_SP_TrusteeAudit_DirectPermissions. It pulls data from views including:

SA_ADInventory_UsersView
SA_ADInventory_GroupsView
SA_SPAA_DirectPermissionsView
SA_SPAA_SiteCollectionsTraversalView

During a test run, the scan consumed over 100 GB of tempDB in just 27 minutes. I've attached screenshots for your reference.","Run SP_TrsuteeAudit job.

Cause:
