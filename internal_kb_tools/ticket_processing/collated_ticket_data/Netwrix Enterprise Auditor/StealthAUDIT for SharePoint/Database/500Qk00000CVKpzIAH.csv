Could help me with one issue that we got here with SharePoint on-prem agent-based DLP scans.
 
DLP scans for 3 SharePoint instances running for 15 hours, scanning a lot of files, we can see permissions and activity, but DLP results seems to be not imported to database.
 
Last time we made upgrade of NEA console and SP agents to the latest build, and also we wiped out all SP data from database, but the results is the same.
 
Do you have maybe any experience or idea about that error that we can see on the screen and in logs.

Regards,
Adam Rudnicki","","","","Ran repair, T2 files were damaged?","Incorrect configuration: target server software","Ilya Kotov","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for SharePoint","Database","11.6","11.6.0.82","30.3","Closed - Resolved","RKW SE Zweigniederlassung Wasserburg","Support Appeal","2024-07-01T07:06:05.000Z","2024-07-31T15:12:33.000Z"
