goes through the FS and report security groups and the paths

uses SA_FSAA_PrermissionsView

includes groups and users

wants to filter out users

 

modified filters and filtered for only domain users using TrusteeTypeDescription column

 

the report shows the folder path, but he would prefer the share path

 

may need to engage with ProServ for this
-he doesn't really want to do that, so he's going to play around with SQL View Creation and try to join tables","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2025-03-12T19:01:46.000Z"
