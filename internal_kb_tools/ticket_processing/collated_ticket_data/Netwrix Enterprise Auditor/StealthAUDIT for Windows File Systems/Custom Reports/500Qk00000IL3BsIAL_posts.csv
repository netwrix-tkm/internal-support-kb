Data gathering is to depth of Level 5
They want a report to depth of Level 0.

1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans  > Query Properties > Default Scoping is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) BUT they only want the report to display Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name (it currently has his 2 hostnames).

4) I think it is about building another table and filtering the data that goes into the second table.","","","","005Qk00000276ifIAA","2024-11-14T22:42:47.000Z"
