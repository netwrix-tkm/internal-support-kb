a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.

Hi Vinooth,

It was good to meet with you today.

+++++
CIFS Open Access Report
+++++
a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

#####
1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.
#####

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

AS I have no learned, it is straightforward to make a copy of an existing report in NEA and apply a filter to diplay only one host and records with depth level 0 only.
I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

AS I have no learned, it is straightforward to make a copy of an existing report in NEA and apply a filter to diplay only one host and records with depth level 0 only.
I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

It was good to meet with you today.

+++++
CIFS Open Access Report
+++++
a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

#####
1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.
#####

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

AS I have no learned, it is straightforward to make a copy of an existing report in NEA and apply a filter to diplay only one host and records with depth level 0 only.
I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.

Hi Vinooth,

AS I have no learned, it is straightforward to make a copy of an existing report in NEA and apply a filter to diplay only one host and records with depth level 0 only.
I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

Thank you,
Mike Candon

Hi Vinooth,

It was good to meet with you today.

CIFS Open Access Report

a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

Hi Vinooth,

AS I have no learned, it is straightforward to make a copy of an existing report in NEA and apply a filter to diplay only one host and records with depth level 0 only.
I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

It was good to meet with you today.

+++++
CIFS Open Access Report
+++++
a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

#####
1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.
#####

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

AS I have no learned, it is straightforward to make a copy of an existing report in NEA and apply a filter to diplay only one host and records with depth level 0 only.
I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

It was good to meet with you today.

+++++
CIFS Open Access Report
+++++
a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

#####
1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.

Thank you,
Mike Candon

Hi Vinooth,

AS I have no learned, it is straightforward to make a copy of an existing report in NEA and apply a filter to diplay only one host and records with depth level 0 only.
I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

It was good to meet with you today.

+++++
CIFS Open Access Report
+++++
a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

#####
1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.
#####

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

1) Attached are 5 screenshots in numbered order (SS01 - SS05).  They show how to make a copy of the existing Open Access report (as an example) and apply a filter for one host name and a scan depth of 0 or 1.  Please do not try to create this report if you are unsure as to how to accomplish this after reviewing the 5 screenshots.

I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

It was good to meet with you today.

+++++
CIFS Open Access Report
+++++
a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

#####
1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.
#####

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

1) Attached are 5 screenshots in numbered order (SS01 - SS05).  They show how to make a copy of the existing Open Access report (as an example) and apply a filter for one host name and a scan depth of 0 or 1.  Please do not try to create this report if you are unsure as to how to accomplish this after reviewing the 5 screenshots.

Hi Vinooth,

1) Attached are 5 screenshots in numbered order (SS01 - SS05).  They show how to make a copy of the existing Open Access report (as an example) and apply a filter for one host name and a scan depth of 0 or 1.  Please do not try to create this report if you are unsure as to how to accomplish this after reviewing the 5 screenshots.

Hi Vinooth,

AS I have no learned, it is straightforward to make a copy of an existing report in NEA and apply a filter to diplay only one host and records with depth level 0 only.
I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Mike – Just wanted to circle back this morning and check on this. If you are able to touch base with any of the engineers on your side to facilitate what we are trying to accomplish?

Hi Vinooth,

It was good to meet with you today.

+++++
CIFS Open Access Report
+++++
a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

#####
1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.
#####

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

AS I have no learned, it is straightforward to make a copy of an existing report in NEA and apply a filter to diplay only one host and records with depth level 0 only.
I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

It was good to meet with you today.

+++++
CIFS Open Access Report
+++++
a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

#####
1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.
#####

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

We met in a MS Teams meeting on 15-Nov-2024 to create a new report from an existing report and customize it to only show records with scan depth = 0 and for only one hostname.  Are you all set with this case?  May I close this case?

+++++
Based upon the 5 attached screenshots which show and annotate the steps to copy and create a new report in NEA:

Hi Vinooth,

1) Attached are 5 screenshots in numbered order (SS01 - SS05).  They show how to make a copy of the existing Open Access report (as an example) and apply a filter for one host name and a scan depth of 0 or 1.  Please do not try to create this report if you are unsure as to how to accomplish this after reviewing the 5 screenshots.

Hi Vinooth,

AS I have no learned, it is straightforward to make a copy of an existing report in NEA and apply a filter to diplay only one host and records with depth level 0 only.
I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Mike – Just wanted to circle back this morning and check on this. If you are able to touch base with any of the engineers on your side to facilitate what we are trying to accomplish?

Hi Vinooth,

It was good to meet with you today.

+++++
CIFS Open Access Report
+++++
a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

#####
1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.
#####

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Vinooth,

1) Attached are 5 screenshots in numbered order (SS01 - SS05).  They show how to make a copy of the existing Open Access report (as an example) and apply a filter for one host name and a scan depth of 0 or 1.  Please do not try to create this report if you are unsure as to how to accomplish this after reviewing the 5 screenshots.

Hi Vinooth,

AS I have no learned, it is straightforward to make a copy of an existing report in NEA and apply a filter to diplay only one host and records with depth level 0 only.
I would have screenshots for you but I have not had time to create them this morning.

I will be in a meeting until 11:30 AM this but I can send you a meeting request that will show available timeslots for the remainder of the day.
Or we can tentatively plan to meet at 11:45 AM this morning or 12 noon as long as my current meeting has ended.

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Mike – Just wanted to circle back this morning and check on this. If you are able to touch base with any of the engineers on your side to facilitate what we are trying to accomplish?

Hi Vinooth,

It was good to meet with you today.

+++++
CIFS Open Access Report
+++++
a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) You want to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of your 2 hostnames.
c) You want to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5 which will not be emailed.

#####
1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) ""FileSystem"" > 1-FSAA System Scans > ""Query Properties"" > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But you only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name.  Your current report has your 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5.

4) I believe that the task may be to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table.
#####

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer
