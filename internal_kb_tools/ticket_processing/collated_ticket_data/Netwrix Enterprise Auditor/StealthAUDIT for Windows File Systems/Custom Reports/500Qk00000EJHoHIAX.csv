Customer is looking for a report that tracks permission changes on the first level of folders

[Resolution]
Implemented a SQLView job that uses the below filter on the FSAC_ActivityEvents table:

OperationDescription like 'Permission%' -- Filter for Permission Changes

AND [ResourceTypeDescription] = 'Folder'
AND (
-- Filter for top-level or second-level folders
LEN([Path]) - LEN(REPLACE([Path], '', '')) <= 2
)

AND CAST([AccessTime] AS DATE) >= CAST(GETDATE() - 7 AS DATE)
AND CAST([AccessTime] AS DATE) <= CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)

We couldn't do every day due to FSAC scan and bulk import schedules, but this will pull permission changes on the top 2 levels of folders for the last 7 days","Guidance","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Custom Reports","11.6","","11.3","Closed - Resolved","ConocoPhillips Company","Frank McNickle","2024-08-12T13:31:20.000Z","2024-08-23T20:59:51.000Z"
