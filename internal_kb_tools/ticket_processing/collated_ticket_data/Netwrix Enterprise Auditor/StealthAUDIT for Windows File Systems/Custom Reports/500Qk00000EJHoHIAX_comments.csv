OperationDescription like 'Permission%' -- Filter for Permission Changes
  
AND [ResourceTypeDescription] = 'Folder'  -- Filter for folders (customer wants to exclude file-level permission changes)
 
AND (LEN([Path]) - LEN(REPLACE([Path], '', '')) <= 2)  -- Filter for top-level or second-level folders

AND CAST([AccessTime] AS DATE) = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE) --Only show permission changes that occurred today","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2024-08-12T19:10:15.000Z","2024-08-12T19:10:15.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000008fHY9IAM","500Qk00000EJHoHIAX","Met with customer today and implemented a SQLView job that uses the below filter on the FSAC_ActivityEvents table:

OperationDescription like 'Permission%' -- Filter for Permission Changes
  
AND [ResourceTypeDescription] = 'Folder'    
AND (
        -- Filter for top-level or second-level folders

    )

AND CAST([AccessTime] AS DATE) >= CAST(GETDATE() - 7 AS DATE)
AND CAST([AccessTime] AS DATE) <= CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)

We couldn't do every day due to FSAC scan and bulk import schedules, but this will pull permission changes on the top 2 levels of folders for the last 7 days","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2024-08-21T20:38:32.000Z","2024-08-21T20:39:14.000Z","false","false"
