"500Qk00000IL3BsIAL","00427167","Support Ticket","NEA - Report issue - How to copy/configure a FS Open Access report","Looking for help to recreate a report without few details automatically and mail to a specific DL on a weekly basis.","","+++++
CIFS Open Access Report
+++++
a) Current data gathering is to depth of Level 5
b) Customer wants to email a report with a depth of Level 0 only and for only one (1) of their 2 hostnames.
c) Customer wants to maintain the original report with the 2 hostnames and to a depth of Level 5.

#####
1) Global Settings > Notifications to set up email.

2) In NEA navigate to: Jobs > ""FileSystem"" > ""0.Collection"" > ""1-FSAA System Scans"" > ""Configure"" > ""Queries"" > ""Query Properties"" > Configure button > ""Default Scoping"" is set with ""Limit sub-folder scan depth to 5 levels""

3) But they only want the report to display records with a Scan Depth = 0 and only one host name (the current report has their 2 hostnames and records with a scan depth of up to 5).

4) I think the task is to build another table and filter the data that goes into the second table. 
#####","Build an example of the report in my lab possibly.","See the 5 attached screenshots which show and annotate the steps to copy and create a new report in NEA:
