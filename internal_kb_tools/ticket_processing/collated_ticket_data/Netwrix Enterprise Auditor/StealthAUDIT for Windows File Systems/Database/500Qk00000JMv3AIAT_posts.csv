We checked the disk usage by Table on the SQL server and found that most of the space was occupied by this table:
StealthAUDIT.dbo.SA_FS_TagsMapped

This table is created by the  4.Content > Tags > FS_FileTags job. We disabled this job for both of the File System storages that are configured for auditing in StealthAudit. 

We then truncated contents of this table using this SQL command:
truncate table StealthAUDIT.dbo.SA_FS_TagsMapped;

This freed up space inside the database container itself, however the disk space is not reclaimed after this. 
According to the information we got from SSMS - after truncating that table the database container now has 46% of space available. 

As an attempt to free up disk space we started database shrinking from SSMS. 
We agreed with customer to keep shrinking operation running and then continue troubleshooting on Monday.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2024-12-13T15:39:32.000Z"

Depending on the result of the NEA db shrinking, we will either continue dropping/truncating existing tables. 
Since customer does not care about data stored in NEA db - deleting everything and re-installing software is also an option for them as a last resort.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2024-12-13T15:40:50.000Z"
