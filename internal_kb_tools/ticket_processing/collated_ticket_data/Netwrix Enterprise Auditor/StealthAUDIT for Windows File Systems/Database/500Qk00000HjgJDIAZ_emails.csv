Thanks Tay for the information as well as the meeting invite. I think I will go ahead and schedule something with you as I might have a couple of additional questions.

Also, on ticket #00423699 we have a meeting scheduled for 11/6 at 10:00 CST. Can we reschedule that one as I have a personal conflict that has arisen?

Thanks
Frank

Hey Frank!

They tossed your ticket in my queue!

Clearing out that old host data should be fairly easy. I've attached a document with the steps, but also feel free to use the link below to schedule a remote session for us to do this together:

Hi Frank,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support, my name is Lestat. I'm happy to assist you today.

To ensure I understand your needs accurately, could you please clarify a few details regarding the hosts you'd like to purge from the database:

1. By hosts, do you mean all activity records pertaining to a host machine? For ex: decommissioned servers?  Correct - old servers that have be decommed

2. When you refer to removing these items from your database, do you mean remove them from your SQL Database, or remove them from your Monitoring Plan from your Netwrix console? Remove them from everywhere they might be located including the database

3. Would you mind sharing your current Database retention settings? You can find this by navigating to Netwrix Auditor > Settings > Audit Database > Database Retention I apologize but we are running version 11.5 so I'm not finding that in our console but I recall that we have a 6 month retention period. I included a list of offline servers in the original ticket that I need to remove

[cid:image001.png@01DB2F58.D5EE8DD0]



Thanks
Frank



With these additional details, I'll be able to provide you with a more precise solution.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

	Created a list of hosts with the status of offline (Offline Hosts)
	Created a custom job (DropFSHost) in the zClone_Sandbox folder that will drop the data for the offline servers from the file system database tables
	Scheduled the job --kick this off when there are no File System jobs running


Let me know how things look after that job gets a chance to run!

Once again, thanks for all your assistance with helping us!! I monitored the server over the weekend and was able to kick of the job below as the bulk import job finally completed Monday evening.

 

I’ll keep you posted 😊

Hey Frank,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:


	Created a list of hosts with the status of offline (Offline Hosts)
	Created a custom job (DropFSHost) in the zClone_Sandbox folder that will drop the data for the offline servers from the file system database tables
	Scheduled the job --kick this off when there are no File System jobs running



Let me know how things look after that job gets a chance to run!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

It appears that a few were successful, but many appear to have been aborted. We did have a reboot on Saturday (11/16) so not sure if that had something to do with it or not. I have relaunched the job again via the schedule.

Hello Tay!

Once again, thanks for all your assistance with helping us!! I monitored the server over the weekend and was able to kick of the job below as the bulk import job finally completed Monday evening.

I’ll keep you posted 😊

Hey Frank,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

  1.  Created a list of hosts with the status of offline (Offline Hosts)
  2.  Created a custom job (DropFSHost) in the zClone_Sandbox folder that will drop the data for the offline servers from the file system database tables
  3.  Scheduled the job --kick this off when there are no File System jobs running

Let me know how things look after that job gets a chance to run!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Thanks Tay for the information as well as the meeting invite. I think I will go ahead and schedule something with you as I might have a couple of additional questions.

Also, on ticket #00423699 we have a meeting scheduled for 11/6 at 10:00 CST. Can we reschedule that one as I have a personal conflict that has arisen?

Hi Frank,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support, my name is Lestat. I'm happy to assist you today.

To ensure I understand your needs accurately, could you please clarify a few details regarding the hosts you'd like to purge from the database:

1. By hosts, do you mean all activity records pertaining to a host machine? For ex: decommissioned servers?  Correct – old servers that have be decommed

2. When you refer to removing these items from your database, do you mean remove them from your SQL Database, or remove them from your Monitoring Plan from your Netwrix console? Remove them from everywhere they might be located including the database

3. Would you mind sharing your current Database retention settings? You can find this by navigating to Netwrix Auditor > Settings > Audit Database > Database Retention I apologize but we are running version 11.5 so I’m not finding that in our console but I recall that we have a 6 month retention period. I included a list of offline servers in the original ticket that I need to remove

[cid:image002.png@01DB39CC.63A5E650]



Thanks
Frank



With these additional details, I’ll be able to provide you with a more precise solution.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Hello Tay,

 

It appears that a few were successful, but many appear to have been aborted. We did have a reboot on Saturday (11/16) so not sure if that had something to do with it or not. I have relaunched the job again via the schedule.

Below is a screenshot of the job status

[cid:image001.png@01DB3CF5.3D6C3F80]

What is the easiest way to confirm they have been removed? Also, do I need to remove these from the All Windows Host list or does the script also do that as I am still seeing them….?

Thanks and have a great weekend!

Hello Tay,

It appears that a few were successful, but many appear to have been aborted. We did have a reboot on Saturday (11/16) so not sure if that had something to do with it or not. I have relaunched the job again via the schedule.

Hey Frank,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

  1.  Created a list of hosts with the status of offline (Offline Hosts)
  2.  Created a custom job (DropFSHost) in the zClone_Sandbox folder that will drop the data for the offline servers from the file system database tables
  3.  Scheduled the job --kick this off when there are no File System jobs running

Let me know how things look after that job gets a chance to run!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

To check if the host have been removed from the database, look under the Results > FSAA_Hosts view under the DropFSHost. This will list the current File System hosts. Servers will need to be manually removed from the Host Management table. If you do this on the master table (click the Host Management node), if will remove them from all subsequent host lists.

Let me know if you need any more clarity on things!

Thank you,

Hello Tay,

 

Below is a screenshot of the job status

 



 

What is the easiest way to confirm they have been removed? Also, do I need to remove these from the All Windows Host list or does the script also do that as I am still seeing them….?

 



 

Thanks and have a great weekend!

Hey Frank,

Thank you for the update. Let me know how things look after the next run of the job.

If you see any with a weird name like ""!REMOVED_{HOSTNAME}"", that means it didn't complete the removal gracefully on the previous run. To fix this, just add the full ""!REMOVED_{HOSTNAME}"" to the DropFSHost job host list and re-run.

Thank you,

I believe this looks good… to clarify, I can go to the All Windows Host and remove the ones that we removed via your script, correct (the offline ones) ?

Hey Frank!

To check if the host have been removed from the database, look under the Results > FSAA_Hosts view under the DropFSHost. This will list the current File System hosts. Servers will need to be manually removed from the Host Management table. If you do this on the master table (click the Host Management node), if will remove them from all subsequent host lists.

Let me know if you need any more clarity on things!

Thank you,

Hello Tay,

Below is a screenshot of the job status

[cid:image002.png@01DB3F56.A0523100]

What is the easiest way to confirm they have been removed? Also, do I need to remove these from the All Windows Host list or does the script also do that as I am still seeing them….?

[cid:image003.png@01DB3F56.A0523100]

Thanks and have a great weekend!

Hey Frank,

Thank you for the update. Let me know how things look after the next run of the job.

If you see any with a weird name like ""!REMOVED_{HOSTNAME}"", that means it didn't complete the removal gracefully on the previous run. To fix this, just add the full ""!REMOVED_{HOSTNAME}"" to the DropFSHost job host list and re-run.

Thank you,

Hello Tay,

It appears that a few were successful, but many appear to have been aborted. We did have a reboot on Saturday (11/16) so not sure if that had something to do with it or not. I have relaunched the job again via the schedule.

Hey Frank,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

  1.  Created a list of hosts with the status of offline (Offline Hosts)
  2.  Created a custom job (DropFSHost) in the zClone_Sandbox folder that will drop the data for the offline servers from the file system database tables
  3.  Scheduled the job --kick this off when there are no File System jobs running

Let me know how things look after that job gets a chance to run!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Thanks Tay for the information as well as the meeting invite. I think I will go ahead and schedule something with you as I might have a couple of additional questions.

Also, on ticket #00423699 we have a meeting scheduled for 11/6 at 10:00 CST. Can we reschedule that one as I have a personal conflict that has arisen?

Hey Frank!

They tossed your ticket in my queue!

Clearing out that old host data should be fairly easy. I've attached a document with the steps, but also feel free to use the link below to schedule a remote session for us to do this together:

Hi Frank,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support, my name is Lestat. I'm happy to assist you today.

To ensure I understand your needs accurately, could you please clarify a few details regarding the hosts you'd like to purge from the database:

1. By hosts, do you mean all activity records pertaining to a host machine? For ex: decommissioned servers?  Correct – old servers that have be decommed

2. When you refer to removing these items from your database, do you mean remove them from your SQL Database, or remove them from your Monitoring Plan from your Netwrix console? Remove them from everywhere they might be located including the database

3. Would you mind sharing your current Database retention settings? You can find this by navigating to Netwrix Auditor > Settings > Audit Database > Database Retention I apologize but we are running version 11.5 so I’m not finding that in our console but I recall that we have a 6 month retention period. I included a list of offline servers in the original ticket that I need to remove

[cid:image005.png@01DB3F56.A0523100]



Thanks
Frank



With these additional details, I’ll be able to provide you with a more precise solution.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

I’d recommend removing them from the master list as this will remove them from all subsequent lists. 

To remove the hosts from the master list, click directly on the “Host Management” node, select the host from the list, and then select “Delete Host” from the action pane on the right.

Thank you,

Thanks Tay for the information as well as the meeting invite. I think I will go ahead and schedule something with you as I might have a couple of additional questions.

 

Also, on ticket #00423699 we have a meeting scheduled for 11/6 at 10:00 CST. Can we reschedule that one as I have a personal conflict that has arisen?

 

Thanks

Frank

Hey Frank!

They tossed your ticket in my queue!

Clearing out that old host data should be fairly easy. I've attached a document with the steps, but also feel free to use the link below to schedule a remote session for us to do this together:

Hi Frank, 

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support, my name is Lestat. I'm happy to assist you today.

To ensure I understand your needs accurately, could you please clarify a few details regarding the hosts you'd like to purge from the database:

1. By hosts, do you mean all activity records pertaining to a host machine? For ex: decommissioned servers?  Correct – old servers that have be decommed

2. When you refer to removing these items from your database, do you mean remove them from your SQL Database, or remove them from your Monitoring Plan from your Netwrix console? Remove them from everywhere they might be located including the database

3. Would you mind sharing your current Database retention settings? You can find this by navigating to Netwrix Auditor > Settings > Audit Database > Database Retention I apologize but we are running version 11.5 so I’m not finding that in our console but I recall that we have a 6 month retention period. I included a list of offline servers in the original ticket that I need to remove



 

Thanks
Frank

 

With these additional details, I’ll be able to provide you with a more precise solution.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Hey Frank,

I’d recommend removing them from the master list as this will remove them from all subsequent lists.

To remove the hosts from the master list, click directly on the “Host Management” node, select the host from the list, and then select “Delete Host” from the action pane on the right.

Thank you,

I believe this looks good… to clarify, I can go to the All Windows Host and remove the ones that we removed via your script, correct (the offline ones) ?

Hey Frank!

To check if the host have been removed from the database, look under the Results > FSAA_Hosts view under the DropFSHost. This will list the current File System hosts. Servers will need to be manually removed from the Host Management table. If you do this on the master table (click the Host Management node), if will remove them from all subsequent host lists.

Let me know if you need any more clarity on things!

Thank you,

Hello Tay,

Below is a screenshot of the job status

[cid:image002.png@01DB3FF2.0A0E33A0]

What is the easiest way to confirm they have been removed? Also, do I need to remove these from the All Windows Host list or does the script also do that as I am still seeing them….?

[cid:image003.png@01DB3FF2.0A0E33A0]

Thanks and have a great weekend!

Hey Frank,

Thank you for the update. Let me know how things look after the next run of the job.

If you see any with a weird name like ""!REMOVED_{HOSTNAME}"", that means it didn't complete the removal gracefully on the previous run. To fix this, just add the full ""!REMOVED_{HOSTNAME}"" to the DropFSHost job host list and re-run.

Thank you,

Hello Tay,

It appears that a few were successful, but many appear to have been aborted. We did have a reboot on Saturday (11/16) so not sure if that had something to do with it or not. I have relaunched the job again via the schedule.

Once again, thanks for all your assistance with helping us!! I monitored the server over the weekend and was able to kick of the job below as the bulk import job finally completed Monday evening.

Hey Frank,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

  1.  Created a list of hosts with the status of offline (Offline Hosts)
  2.  Created a custom job (DropFSHost) in the zClone_Sandbox folder that will drop the data for the offline servers from the file system database tables
  3.  Scheduled the job --kick this off when there are no File System jobs running

Let me know how things look after that job gets a chance to run!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Thanks Tay for the additional information and assistance. I have removed the offline servers now that the cleanup is complete.

 

Please feel free to close this ticket.

 

Once again, a huge thanks for all that you do on supporting us.

 

Take care and have a Great Thanksgiving.

Frank

Hey Frank,

I’d recommend removing them from the master list as this will remove them from all subsequent lists. 

To remove the hosts from the master list, click directly on the “Host Management” node, select the host from the list, and then select “Delete Host” from the action pane on the right.

Thank you,

I believe this looks good… to clarify, I can go to the All Windows Host and remove the ones that we removed via your script, correct (the offline ones) ?

 



 

 

Thanks

Frank

Hey Frank!

To check if the host have been removed from the database, look under the Results > FSAA_Hosts view under the DropFSHost. This will list the current File System hosts. Servers will need to be manually removed from the Host Management table. If you do this on the master table (click the Host Management node), if will remove them from all subsequent host lists.

Let me know if you need any more clarity on things!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Tay,

 

Below is a screenshot of the job status

 



 

What is the easiest way to confirm they have been removed? Also, do I need to remove these from the All Windows Host list or does the script also do that as I am still seeing them….?

 



 

Thanks and have a great weekend!

FM

Hey Frank,

Thank you for the update. Let me know how things look after the next run of the job.

If you see any with a weird name like ""!REMOVED_{HOSTNAME}"", that means it didn't complete the removal gracefully on the previous run. To fix this, just add the full ""!REMOVED_{HOSTNAME}"" to the DropFSHost job host list and re-run.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Tay,

 

It appears that a few were successful, but many appear to have been aborted. We did have a reboot on Saturday (11/16) so not sure if that had something to do with it or not. I have relaunched the job again via the schedule.

Thank you,

Hey Frank!

Thank you for the update. I've also got that new report ready for you (Whether or not the FS scans and imports were successful or failed on their last run) and we can add that during our call tomorrow!

Hello Tay!

 

Once again, thanks for all your assistance with helping us!! I monitored the server over the weekend and was able to kick of the job below as the bulk import job finally completed Monday evening.

 

I’ll keep you posted 😊

Hey Frank,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:


	Created a list of hosts with the status of offline (Offline Hosts)
	Created a custom job (DropFSHost) in the zClone_Sandbox folder that will drop the data for the offline servers from the file system database tables
	Scheduled the job --kick this off when there are no File System jobs running



Let me know how things look after that job gets a chance to run!

Thank you,

Thanks Tay for the information as well as the meeting invite. I think I will go ahead and schedule something with you as I might have a couple of additional questions.

 

Also, on ticket #00423699 we have a meeting scheduled for 11/6 at 10:00 CST. Can we reschedule that one as I have a personal conflict that has arisen?

 

Thanks

Frank

Hey Frank!

They tossed your ticket in my queue!

Clearing out that old host data should be fairly easy. I've attached a document with the steps, but also feel free to use the link below to schedule a remote session for us to do this together:

Hi Frank, 

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support, my name is Lestat. I'm happy to assist you today.

To ensure I understand your needs accurately, could you please clarify a few details regarding the hosts you'd like to purge from the database:

1. By hosts, do you mean all activity records pertaining to a host machine? For ex: decommissioned servers?  Correct – old servers that have be decommed

2. When you refer to removing these items from your database, do you mean remove them from your SQL Database, or remove them from your Monitoring Plan from your Netwrix console? Remove them from everywhere they might be located including the database

3. Would you mind sharing your current Database retention settings? You can find this by navigating to Netwrix Auditor > Settings > Audit Database > Database Retention I apologize but we are running version 11.5 so I’m not finding that in our console but I recall that we have a 6 month retention period. I included a list of offline servers in the original ticket that I need to remove



 

Thanks
Frank

 

With these additional details, I’ll be able to provide you with a more precise solution.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.
