Need help investigating why StealthAudit is reporting fileshares incorrectly.","Select * from SA_FSAA_DirectPermissionsView where where ID = '23892' or ID = '23893';","--------

Drop of host data in FSAA cleared up the mismatch that was being seen. Greg is now working to resolve the other 21 hosts and has a target date of completion for April 14th.

--------
The issue is being generated by custom views built by the Netwrix team. The views are not properly filtering out data from the gates table, leading to the customer seeing subfolders on some queries and the wrong permissions being removed in the environment.
--------
02/27/2025
--------
Upon using the new query we found that the subfolder no longer shows up, but one server does not show shares either. When we query the gates table we see that the folder has a shareID and a folder ID, but the share ID does not exist on the host. We were able to find the share, but the ID is completely wrong.
----------------------------------------------------------
SQL query indicates that the shareID for one resource, and the folderID of another sub folder both come back as 23892.
This is leading to permissions getting crossed as these two resources are not related and should not be possible on the same server.

--------
02/07/2025
--------
Modified the customer script to filter by resource type as the issue appears to be that folders and shares are allowed to have the same resource ID and need further filtering.
The additional field of ResourceType allows us to filter by a share resource (0) or a folder resource (2,3,5).","Follow up with Greg after cleanup of remaining servers has been completed.","Issue:
Share IDs are returning with unexpected values in the Gates table.

Cause:
Deleted and modified shares used previous IDs and were not cleaned from the database leading to new IDs having to be used.

Resolution:
Dropped data for affected hosts from the database and re scanned.","Guidance","Ian Ranstrom","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Database","11.5","","78.7","Closed - Resolved","Bank of America Corporation","Greg Dieter","2025-01-29T21:14:15.000Z","2025-04-18T14:45:38.000Z"
