""Unexpected exception: The specified path, file name, or both are too long.

You have to shrink the job name for Bulk Import jobs of both NHY and GLOBAL domains.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:


	Please make sure you have enough disk space on the drive where the StealthAUDIT is installed.
	Run the repair against ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001 hosts of NHY domain. Follow the screenshot for the details. The repair might take some time so please wait for the completion. 



Please let us know the results once these checks are completed.

------------------------------------------
""Unexpected exception: The specified path, file name, or both are too long.

You have to shrink the job name for Bulk Import jobs of both NHY and GLOBAL domains.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:

  1.  Please make sure you have enough disk space on the drive where the StealthAUDIT is installed.
  2.  Run the repair against ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001 hosts of NHY domain. Follow the screenshot for the details. The repair might take some time so please wait for the completion.

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix Technical Support.
What is the error message you are getting from the Bulk Import job?

Can you set the Bulk Import to Debug mode and send us the log so we can review it?
To put the job on Debug mode, right-click on the job and click Properties.
Under the General tab, you will see the Log Level. If it is not already on Debug, click the dropdown and select it.

If the job was already on Debug, right-click on it and click Explore Folder. Open the OUTPUT folder, and you will see the FSAA Bulk Import_Log.tsv, which you can upload to this ticket.

If the job was not on Debug, you must put it on Debug, and you would need to rerun the job to collect the log before sending it to us.

You can use the link below to schedule a meeting.

Hi Alek,

 


	SQL DB LOW Space: SQL DB space is less. Could you Analyse our SA environment and suggest how much space increase is required ?


 



 


	
	Drive space has been verified and confirmed that enough disk space is available. 

	
	 
	
	




 

 3. The specified path, file name, or both are too long.

Path and folder name is updated it to short. 



 





 

 

4.Run the repair against Problematic servers ( ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001)

    Ran repair successfully for problematic server.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:

Hi Saveetha,

------------------------------------------
""Unexpected exception: The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters"" error means that Windows cannot access the report file due to a long path to that report. You have to shrink the job name for Bulk Import jobs of both NHY and GLOBAL domains.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:

  1.  Please make sure you have enough disk space on the drive where the StealthAUDIT is installed.
  2.  Run the repair against ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001 hosts of NHY domain. Follow the screenshot for the details. The repair might take some time so please wait for the completion.

Please let us know the results once these checks are completed.

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix Technical Support.
What is the error message you are getting from the Bulk Import job?

Can you set the Bulk Import to Debug mode and send us the log so we can review it?
To put the job on Debug mode, right-click on the job and click Properties.
Under the General tab, you will see the Log Level. If it is not already on Debug, click the dropdown and select it.

If the job was already on Debug, right-click on it and click Explore Folder. Open the OUTPUT folder, and you will see the FSAA Bulk Import_Log.tsv, which you can upload to this ticket.

If the job was not on Debug, you must put it on Debug, and you would need to rerun the job to collect the log before sending it to us.

You can use the link below to schedule a meeting.

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix Technical Support.
What is the error message you are getting from the Bulk Import job?

Can you set the Bulk Import to Debug mode and send us the log so we can review it?
To put the job on Debug mode, right-click on the job and click Properties.
Under the General tab, you will see the Log Level. If it is not already on Debug, click the dropdown and select it.

If the job was already on Debug, right-click on it and click Explore Folder. Open the OUTPUT folder, and you will see the FSAA Bulk Import_Log.tsv, which you can upload to this ticket.

If the job was not on Debug, you must put it on Debug, and you would need to rerun the job to collect the log before sending it to us.

You can use the link below to schedule a meeting.

Hi Alek,

 


	SQL DB LOW Space: SQL DB space is less. Could you Analyse our SA environment and suggest how much space increase is required ?


 



 


	
	Drive space has been verified and confirmed that enough disk space is available. 

	
	 
	
	




 

 3. The specified path, file name, or both are too long.

Path and folder name is updated it to short. 



 





 

 

4.Run the repair against Problematic servers ( ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001)

    Ran repair successfully for problematic server.

You have to shrink the job name for Bulk Import jobs of both NHY and GLOBAL domains.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:


	Please make sure you have enough disk space on the drive where the StealthAUDIT is installed.
	Run the repair against ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001 hosts of NHY domain. Follow the screenshot for the details. The repair might take some time so please wait for the completion. 



Please let us know the results once these checks are completed.

Hi Saveetha,

------------------------------------------
""Unexpected exception: The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters"" error means that Windows cannot access the report file due to a long path to that report. You have to shrink the job name for Bulk Import jobs of both NHY and GLOBAL domains.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:

  1.  Please make sure you have enough disk space on the drive where the StealthAUDIT is installed.
  2.  Run the repair against ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001 hosts of NHY domain. Follow the screenshot for the details. The repair might take some time so please wait for the completion.

Please let us know the results once these checks are completed.

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix Technical Support.
What is the error message you are getting from the Bulk Import job?

Can you set the Bulk Import to Debug mode and send us the log so we can review it?
To put the job on Debug mode, right-click on the job and click Properties.
Under the General tab, you will see the Log Level. If it is not already on Debug, click the dropdown and select it.

If the job was already on Debug, right-click on it and click Explore Folder. Open the OUTPUT folder, and you will see the FSAA Bulk Import_Log.tsv, which you can upload to this ticket.

If the job was not on Debug, you must put it on Debug, and you would need to rerun the job to collect the log before sending it to us.

You can use the link below to schedule a meeting.

Hi Netwrix Team,

 

Bulk import still fails. And we have requested SQL team to increase the Stealth Audit DB size. Once SQL team completed the activity, we will check and update you.

Hi Alek,

 


	SQL DB LOW Space: SQL DB space is less. Could you Analyse our SA environment and suggest how much space increase is required ?


 



 


	
	Drive space has been verified and confirmed that enough disk space is available. 

	
	 
	
	




 

 3. The specified path, file name, or both are too long.

Path and folder name is updated it to short. 



 





 

 

4.Run the repair against Problematic servers ( ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001)

    Ran repair successfully for problematic server.

Hi Saveetha,

------------------------------------------
""Unexpected exception: The specified path, file name, or both are too long.

You have to shrink the job name for Bulk Import jobs of both NHY and GLOBAL domains.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:


	Please make sure you have enough disk space on the drive where the StealthAUDIT is installed.
	Run the repair against ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001 hosts of NHY domain. Follow the screenshot for the details. The repair might take some time so please wait for the completion. 



Please let us know the results once these checks are completed.

Hi Saveetha,
 
Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix Technical Support.
What is the error message you are getting from the Bulk Import job?
 
Can you set the Bulk Import to Debug mode and send us the log so we can review it?
To put the job on Debug mode, right-click on the job and click Properties.
Under the General tab, you will see the Log Level. If it is not already on Debug, click the dropdown and select it.
 
If the job was already on Debug, right-click on it and click Explore Folder. Open the OUTPUT folder, and you will see the FSAA Bulk Import_Log.tsv, which you can upload to this ticket.
 
If the job was not on Debug, you must put it on Debug, and you would need to rerun the job to collect the log before sending it to us.
 
You can use the link below to schedule a meeting.

Hi Saveetha,

I reviewed the attached Bulk Import logs for both domains and here are the errors:

------------------------------------------
""Unexpected exception: The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters"" error means that Windows cannot access the report file due to a long path to that report. You have to shrink the job name for Bulk Import jobs of both NHY and GLOBAL domains.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:

  1.  Please make sure you have enough disk space on the drive where the StealthAUDIT is installed.
  2.  Run the repair against ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001 hosts of NHY domain. Follow the screenshot for the details. The repair might take some time so please wait for the completion.

Please let us know the results once these checks are completed.

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix Technical Support.
What is the error message you are getting from the Bulk Import job?

Can you set the Bulk Import to Debug mode and send us the log so we can review it?
To put the job on Debug mode, right-click on the job and click Properties.
Under the General tab, you will see the Log Level. If it is not already on Debug, click the dropdown and select it.

If the job was already on Debug, right-click on it and click Explore Folder. Open the OUTPUT folder, and you will see the FSAA Bulk Import_Log.tsv, which you can upload to this ticket.

If the job was not on Debug, you must put it on Debug, and you would need to rerun the job to collect the log before sending it to us.

You can use the link below to schedule a meeting.

We will check for this week's bulk import report and write back to you on Monday.

Hi Netwrix Team,

 

Bulk import still fails. And we have requested SQL team to increase the Stealth Audit DB size. Once SQL team completed the activity, we will check and update you.

Hi Alek,

 


	SQL DB LOW Space: SQL DB space is less. Could you Analyse our SA environment and suggest how much space increase is required ?


 



 


	
	Drive space has been verified and confirmed that enough disk space is available. 

	
	 
	
	




 

 3. The specified path, file name, or both are too long.

Path and folder name is updated it to short. 



 





 

 

4.Run the repair against Problematic servers ( ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001)

    Ran repair successfully for problematic server.

You have to shrink the job name for Bulk Import jobs of both NHY and GLOBAL domains.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:


	Please make sure you have enough disk space on the drive where the StealthAUDIT is installed.
	Run the repair against ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001 hosts of NHY domain. Follow the screenshot for the details. The repair might take some time so please wait for the completion. 



Please let us know the results once these checks are completed.

Hi Saveetha,
 
Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix Technical Support.
What is the error message you are getting from the Bulk Import job?
 
Can you set the Bulk Import to Debug mode and send us the log so we can review it?
To put the job on Debug mode, right-click on the job and click Properties.
Under the General tab, you will see the Log Level. If it is not already on Debug, click the dropdown and select it.
 
If the job was already on Debug, right-click on it and click Explore Folder. Open the OUTPUT folder, and you will see the FSAA Bulk Import_Log.tsv, which you can upload to this ticket.
 
If the job was not on Debug, you must put it on Debug, and you would need to rerun the job to collect the log before sending it to us.
 
You can use the link below to schedule a meeting.

Hi Alek,

 


	SQL DB LOW Space: SQL DB space is less. Could you Analyse our SA environment and suggest how much space increase is required ?


 



 


	
	Drive space has been verified and confirmed that enough disk space is available. 

	
	 
	
	




 

 3. The specified path, file name, or both are too long.

Path and folder name is updated it to short. 



 





 

 

4.Run the repair against Problematic servers ( ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001)

    Ran repair successfully for problematic server.

Hi Saveetha,

------------------------------------------
""Unexpected exception: The specified path, file name, or both are too long.

You have to shrink the job name for Bulk Import jobs of both NHY and GLOBAL domains.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:


	Please make sure you have enough disk space on the drive where the StealthAUDIT is installed.
	Run the repair against ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001 hosts of NHY domain. Follow the screenshot for the details. The repair might take some time so please wait for the completion. 



Please let us know the results once these checks are completed.

Hi Saveetha,
 
Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix Technical Support.
What is the error message you are getting from the Bulk Import job?
 
Can you set the Bulk Import to Debug mode and send us the log so we can review it?
To put the job on Debug mode, right-click on the job and click Properties.
Under the General tab, you will see the Log Level. If it is not already on Debug, click the dropdown and select it.
 
If the job was already on Debug, right-click on it and click Explore Folder. Open the OUTPUT folder, and you will see the FSAA Bulk Import_Log.tsv, which you can upload to this ticket.
 
If the job was not on Debug, you must put it on Debug, and you would need to rerun the job to collect the log before sending it to us.
 
You can use the link below to schedule a meeting.

Hi Saveetha,

------------------------------------------
""Unexpected exception: The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters"" error means that Windows cannot access the report file due to a long path to that report. You have to shrink the job name for Bulk Import jobs of both NHY and GLOBAL domains.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:

  1.  Please make sure you have enough disk space on the drive where the StealthAUDIT is installed.
  2.  Run the repair against ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001 hosts of NHY domain. Follow the screenshot for the details. The repair might take some time so please wait for the completion.

Please let us know the results once these checks are completed.

Hi Saveetha,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix Technical Support.
What is the error message you are getting from the Bulk Import job?

Can you set the Bulk Import to Debug mode and send us the log so we can review it?
To put the job on Debug mode, right-click on the job and click Properties.
Under the General tab, you will see the Log Level. If it is not already on Debug, click the dropdown and select it.

If the job was already on Debug, right-click on it and click Explore Folder. Open the OUTPUT folder, and you will see the FSAA Bulk Import_Log.tsv, which you can upload to this ticket.

If the job was not on Debug, you must put it on Debug, and you would need to rerun the job to collect the log before sending it to us.

You can use the link below to schedule a meeting.

It looks like the Tier 2 database is corrupted for those hosts in the list. We need to drop it and rerun the FSAA-System Scans and Bulk Import jobs against affected hosts.

Hi Alek,

 

SQL team has increased the stealth audit DB space. Bulk import scan will run as per schedule on this week Friday. 
We will check for this week's bulk import report and write back to you on Monday.

Hi Netwrix Team,

 

Bulk import still fails. And we have requested SQL team to increase the Stealth Audit DB size. Once SQL team completed the activity, we will check and update you.

Hi Alek,

 


	SQL DB LOW Space: SQL DB space is less. Could you Analyse our SA environment and suggest how much space increase is required ?


 



 


	
	Drive space has been verified and confirmed that enough disk space is available. 

	
	 
	
	




 

 3. The specified path, file name, or both are too long.

Path and folder name is updated it to short. 



 





 

 

4.Run the repair against Problematic servers ( ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001)

    Ran repair successfully for problematic server.

You have to shrink the job name for Bulk Import jobs of both NHY and GLOBAL domains.

Regarding the ""SQL logic error unknown database StrucMap"" error for the NHY domain:


	Please make sure you have enough disk space on the drive where the StealthAUDIT is installed.
	Run the repair against ALNPIAF1201, SZE00-MS006, DESL2PV-EPO001, PHYDNAPSOV01, BRANAPV-PPDA01, NLANLPV-APP001 hosts of NHY domain. Follow the screenshot for the details. The repair might take some time so please wait for the completion. 



Please let us know the results once these checks are completed.

Hi Saveetha,
 
Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix Technical Support.
What is the error message you are getting from the Bulk Import job?
 
Can you set the Bulk Import to Debug mode and send us the log so we can review it?
To put the job on Debug mode, right-click on the job and click Properties.
Under the General tab, you will see the Log Level. If it is not already on Debug, click the dropdown and select it.
 
If the job was already on Debug, right-click on it and click Explore Folder. Open the OUTPUT folder, and you will see the FSAA Bulk Import_Log.tsv, which you can upload to this ticket.
 
If the job was not on Debug, you must put it on Debug, and you would need to rerun the job to collect the log before sending it to us.
 
You can use the link below to schedule a meeting.
