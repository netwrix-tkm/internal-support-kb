Thank you for your patience. After analyzing and consulting with our senior engineers, it's seems that the root cause is in corrupted T1/T2 Databases. We will have to drop the tables, which will result in activity data loss, so you will need to preform a backup first. Would you be okay to proceed with that?

Olaf,

Thank you for your patience. After analyzing and consulting with our senior engineers, it's seems that the root cause is in corrupted T1/T2 Databases. We will have to drop the tables, which will result in activity data loss, so you will need to preform a backup first. Would you be okay to proceed with that?

HI Ilya, 

Yes we are ok with dropping T1/T2 Db but also interested in the root cause of the T1T2 Database to become corrupted

Olaf,

Thank you for your patience. After analyzing and consulting with our senior engineers, it's seems that the root cause is in corrupted T1/T2 Databases. We will have to drop the tables, which will result in activity data loss, so you will need to preform a backup first. Would you be okay to proceed with that?

Olaf,

Thank you for your patience. After analyzing and consulting with our senior engineers, it's seems that the root cause is in corrupted T1/T2 Databases. We will have to drop the tables, which will result in activity data loss, so you will need to preform a backup first. Would you be okay to proceed with that?

HI Ilya, 

Yes we are ok with dropping T1/T2 Db but also interested in the root cause of the T1T2 Database to become corrupted

Olaf,

Thank you for your patience. After analyzing and consulting with our senior engineers, it's seems that the root cause is in corrupted T1/T2 Databases. We will have to drop the tables, which will result in activity data loss, so you will need to preform a backup first. Would you be okay to proceed with that?

Thank you for your time today. I've confirmed that your Bulk Import and Scan jobs are working since the last rescan. The root cause of this issue is very likely to be in your EPP/Antivirus, CrowdStrike, specifically. It's know to interfere with write processes which might break T2 DB's.

Here's the article on exclusions I've mentioned: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Maintenance/AntivirusExclusions.htm

Please implement these. You can forward this email to your IT Sec Team. I confirm that these exclusions are necessary and absolutely required for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor functionality and that the product is not expected to function properly without these exclusions in place.

I'm going to close this ticket now, and if you'd like to leave some feedback - please complete a survey that will be sent to you afterwards. Any comments are appreciated!

Ilya Kotov
