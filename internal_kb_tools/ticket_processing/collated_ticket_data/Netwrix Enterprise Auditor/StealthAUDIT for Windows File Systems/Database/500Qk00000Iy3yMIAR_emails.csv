You can certainly try to run a repair or follow the instruction: To reset scan data, set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table (all existing Access data in Tier 1 will be deleted!)

This will reset the data for it to match.

You can try the Repair first. You can access the table, SA_FSAA_Hosts, and set the parameter called AccessGUID to RESET, which will basically remove all the data. Additionally you can drop the table entirely and run the schema job to recreate it. Make sure to back up the table first.

Hi Iya,

I was thinking we could do either option, however how do you, ‘set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table’?

 

Thank you,

Just wondering if this is related to #420006? As this is effectively an FSAA scan that we are running, to rectify the error below is it a matter of repairing file system data?

Hi Ilya,
We have ran a repair on the hosts but we are still receiving the error below:

I would rather avoid having to drop the tables as we would like to keep the data for comparisons and trends. Please advise the next steps we can take.

Alison, You can try the Repair first. You can access the table, SA_FSAA_Hosts, and set the parameter called AccessGUID to RESET, which will basically remove all the data. Additionally you can drop the table entirely and run the schema job to

Hi Iya,

I was thinking we could do either option, however how do you, ‘set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table’?

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Just wondering if this is related to #420006? As this is effectively an FSAA scan that we are running, to rectify the error below is it a matter of repairing file system data?

Hi Ilya,
We have ran a repair on the hosts but we are still receiving the error below:

Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Tier 2 database does not match Tier 1 data; Access data needs to be reset in order to import this data. To reset scan data, set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table (all existing Access data in Tier 1 will be deleted!)
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground[TResult](Action statusAction, Func`1 execAction)
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground(Action statusAction, Action execAction)
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.BulkImportTask.InternalProcessRecord()
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()

I would rather avoid having to drop the tables as we would like to keep the data for comparisons and trends. Please advise the next steps we can take.

Thank you,
Alison.

Please use the following article to navigate to reset option: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/QuerySelection.htm

You need to get into Maintenance, then run Reset Hosts.

Hi Ilya,

We have ran a repair on the hosts but we are still receiving the error below:

 

Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Tier 2 database does not match Tier 1 data; Access data needs to be reset in order to import this data. To reset scan data, set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table (all existing Access data in Tier 1 will be deleted!)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground[TResult](Action statusAction, Func`1 execAction)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground(Action statusAction, Action execAction)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.BulkImportTask.InternalProcessRecord()

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()

 

I would rather avoid having to drop the tables as we would like to keep the data for comparisons and trends. Please advise the next steps we can take.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Alison, You can try the Repair first. You can access the table, SA_FSAA_Hosts, and set the parameter called AccessGUID to RESET, which will basically remove all the data. Additionally you can drop the table entirely and run the schema job to

Hi Iya,

I was thinking we could do either option, however how do you, ‘set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table’?

 

Thank you,

Just wondering if this is related to #420006? As this is effectively an FSAA scan that we are running, to rectify the error below is it a matter of repairing file system data? 

 



 



 

Thank you,

I ran the Reset Hosts on the scan. On the BI we received the following:

I then ran the Reset Hosts on the scan and Reset Hosts on the BI:

The BI Access table shows the following successes, however the counts of 0 do not look correct:

Hi Ilya,
We have ran a repair on the hosts but we are still receiving the error below:

Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Tier 2 database does not match Tier 1 data; Access data needs to be reset in order to import this data. To reset scan data, set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table (all existing Access data in Tier 1 will be deleted!)
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground[TResult](Action statusAction, Func`1 execAction)
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground(Action statusAction, Action execAction)
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.BulkImportTask.InternalProcessRecord()
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()

I would rather avoid having to drop the tables as we would like to keep the data for comparisons and trends. Please advise the next steps we can take.

Thank you,
Alison.

Alison, You can try the Repair first. You can access the table, SA_FSAA_Hosts, and set the parameter called AccessGUID to RESET, which will basically remove all the data. Additionally you can drop the table entirely and run the schema job to

Hi Iya,
I was thinking we could do either option, however how do you, ‘set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table’?

Just wondering if this is related to #420006? As this is effectively an FSAA scan that we are running, to rectify the error below is it a matter of repairing file system data?

Hi Ilya,

We have ran a repair on the hosts but we are still receiving the error below:

 

Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Tier 2 database does not match Tier 1 data; Access data needs to be reset in order to import this data. To reset scan data, set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table (all existing Access data in Tier 1 will be deleted!)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground[TResult](Action statusAction, Func`1 execAction)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground(Action statusAction, Action execAction)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.BulkImportTask.InternalProcessRecord()

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()

 

I would rather avoid having to drop the tables as we would like to keep the data for comparisons and trends. Please advise the next steps we can take.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Alison, You can try the Repair first. You can access the table, SA_FSAA_Hosts, and set the parameter called AccessGUID to RESET, which will basically remove all the data. Additionally you can drop the table entirely and run the schema job to

I was thinking we could do either option, however how do you, ‘set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table’?

Please advise on the below:

I ran the Reset Hosts on the scan. On the BI we received the following:

I then ran the Reset Hosts on the scan and Reset Hosts on the BI:

The BI Access table shows the following successes, however the counts of 0 do not look correct:

Plus, there are hundreds of hosts to reset….do we have to select each one individually? There does not appear to be a, ‘Select All’ function..

Hi Ilya,

We have ran a repair on the hosts but we are still receiving the error below:

 

Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Tier 2 database does not match Tier 1 data; Access data needs to be reset in order to import this data. To reset scan data, set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table (all existing Access data in Tier 1 will be deleted!)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground[TResult](Action statusAction, Func`1 execAction)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground(Action statusAction, Action execAction)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.BulkImportTask.InternalProcessRecord()

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()

 

I would rather avoid having to drop the tables as we would like to keep the data for comparisons and trends. Please advise the next steps we can take.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Alison, You can try the Repair first. You can access the table, SA_FSAA_Hosts, and set the parameter called AccessGUID to RESET, which will basically remove all the data. Additionally you can drop the table entirely and run the schema job to

Hi Iya,

I was thinking we could do either option, however how do you, ‘set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table’?

Just wondering if this is related to #420006? As this is effectively an FSAA scan that we are running, to rectify the error below is it a matter of repairing file system data?

Apologies Ilya, I am referring to the ‘Reset Hosts’ option in the Scan and BI. The ‘Reset Hosts’ option appears to be a ‘select hosts individually’. Is this correct or is there any way I can select multiple hosts at the same time in ‘Reset Hosts’?

Plus, there are hundreds of hosts to reset….do we have to select each one individually? There does not appear to be a, ‘Select All’ function..

Hi Ilya,
Please advise on the below:

I ran the Reset Hosts on the scan. On the BI we received the following:

I then ran the Reset Hosts on the scan and Reset Hosts on the BI:

The BI Access table shows the following successes, however the counts of 0 do not look correct:

Hi Ilya,
We have ran a repair on the hosts but we are still receiving the error below:

Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Tier 2 database does not match Tier 1 data; Access data needs to be reset in order to import this data. To reset scan data, set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table (all existing Access data in Tier 1 will be deleted!)
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground[TResult](Action statusAction, Func`1 execAction)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.BulkImportTask.InternalProcessRecord()
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()

I would rather avoid having to drop the tables as we would like to keep the data for comparisons and trends. Please advise the next steps we can take.

Thank you,
Alison.

Alison, You can try the Repair first. You can access the table, SA_FSAA_Hosts, and set the parameter called AccessGUID to RESET, which will basically remove all the data. Additionally you can drop the table entirely and run the schema job to

Hi Iya,
I was thinking we could do either option, however how do you, ‘set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table’?

Just wondering if this is related to #420006? As this is effectively an FSAA scan that we are running, to rectify the error below is it a matter of repairing file system data?

Apologies Ilya, I am referring to the ‘Reset Hosts’ option in the Scan and BI. The ‘Reset Hosts’ option appears to be a ‘select hosts individually’. Is this correct or is there any way I can select multiple hosts at the same time in ‘Reset Hosts’?

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Plus, there are hundreds of hosts to reset….do we have to select each one individually? There does not appear to be a, ‘Select All’ function..

Hi Ilya,

A complete rescan with performing Reset Hosts on all servers on both the scan and BI?

 

Thanks,

Hi Ilya,

Please advise on the below:

 

I ran the Reset Hosts on the scan. On the BI we received the following:

 



 

I then ran the Reset Hosts on the scan and Reset Hosts on the BI:



 

The BI Access table shows the following successes, however the counts of 0 do not look correct:

Hi Ilya,

We have ran a repair on the hosts but we are still receiving the error below:

 

Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Tier 2 database does not match Tier 1 data; Access data needs to be reset in order to import this data. To reset scan data, set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table (all existing Access data in Tier 1 will be deleted!)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground[TResult](Action statusAction, Func`1 execAction)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground(Action statusAction, Action execAction)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.BulkImportTask.InternalProcessRecord()

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()

 

I would rather avoid having to drop the tables as we would like to keep the data for comparisons and trends. Please advise the next steps we can take.

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Alison, You can try the Repair first. You can access the table, SA_FSAA_Hosts, and set the parameter called AccessGUID to RESET, which will basically remove all the data. Additionally you can drop the table entirely and run the schema job to

Hi Iya,

I was thinking we could do either option, however how do you, ‘set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table’?

 

Thank you,

Just wondering if this is related to #420006? As this is effectively an FSAA scan that we are running, to rectify the error below is it a matter of repairing file system data?

Apologies Ilya, I am referring to the ‘Reset Hosts’ option in the Scan and BI. The ‘Reset Hosts’ option appears to be a ‘select hosts individually’. Is this correct or is there any way I can select multiple hosts at the same time in ‘Reset Hosts’?

Hi Ilya,
Please advise on the below:

I ran the Reset Hosts on the scan. On the BI we received the following:

[cid:image003.png@01DB458D.F58E2380]

I then ran the Reset Hosts on the scan and Reset Hosts on the BI:
[cid:image004.png@01DB458D.F58E2380]

The BI Access table shows the following successes, however the counts of 0 do not look correct:

Thank you,

Hi Ilya,
We have ran a repair on the hosts but we are still receiving the error below:

Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Tier 2 database does not match Tier 1 data; Access data needs to be reset in order to import this data. To reset scan data, set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table (all existing Access data in Tier 1 will be deleted!)
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground[TResult](Action statusAction, Func`1 execAction)
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground(Action statusAction, Action execAction)
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.BulkImportTask.InternalProcessRecord()
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()

I would rather avoid having to drop the tables as we would like to keep the data for comparisons and trends. Please advise the next steps we can take.

Thank you,
Alison.

Alison, You can try the Repair first. You can access the table, SA_FSAA_Hosts, and set the parameter called AccessGUID to RESET, which will basically remove all the data. Additionally you can drop the table entirely and run the schema job to

Hi Iya,
I was thinking we could do either option, however how do you, ‘set AccessGUID to 'RESET' in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table’?

Thank you,
Alison.

Just wondering if this is related to #420006? As this is effectively an FSAA scan that we are running, to rectify the error below is it a matter of repairing file system data?
