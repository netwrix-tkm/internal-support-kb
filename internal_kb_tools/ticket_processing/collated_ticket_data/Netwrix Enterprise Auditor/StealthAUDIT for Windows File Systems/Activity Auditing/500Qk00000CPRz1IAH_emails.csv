Hi Ilia

I have built a Power BI table to display all of our Open Shares.  We have a very large number and the default reports that come with StealthAudit don't work as required.  Now we have enabled Activity Monitor I wish to use that data and integrate into our Power BI report, showing the accounts that have accessed the data.

Thanks for suggesting SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView, I shall take a look.
