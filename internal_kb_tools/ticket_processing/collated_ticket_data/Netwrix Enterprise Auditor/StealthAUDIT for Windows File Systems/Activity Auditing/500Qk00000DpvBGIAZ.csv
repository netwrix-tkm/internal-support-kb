"500Qk00000DpvBGIAZ","00416732","Support Ticket","Monitoring of file shares","Good day,
We have experienced an issue where user permissions on some of our file shares on our file server have been removed and replaced by the ""Everyone"" user group, and the owner of the folder has also been replaced.

We are currently investigating the rot cause of this, but would like to determine if StealthIntercept can assist with tracking and alerting on any further changes made to monitored directories. The unit responsible for reapplying the file permissions have suggested that permissions are being reverted to the ""Everyone"" group, when they have attempted to may changes.

This request is of the highest priority, and requires urgent attention.","","","","[Issue]
Customer needs assistance setting up activity monitoring to track when and who changes permissions on shares

[Resolution]
1. We added the host to Activity Monitor and set it up to monitor
2. We configured the FSAC scan to scan that host
3. Customer can use the reports to find the culprit if the permission is changed again in the future","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Activity Auditing","11.6","","19.0","Closed - Resolved","Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago","Kevin Fraser","2024-07-31T20:56:05.000Z","2024-08-19T20:51:06.000Z"
