""identical rights"" mean that a trustee has same permissions on the parent folder and folder inside that you are currently looking at. 

Moreover, they also wanted to know why some SIDs were not getting translated to accounts. They have been guided that either those accounts are no longer present in AD or .ADI needs to be re-run. To verify if accounts exist against a SID, check in Powershell with AD module installed:

$SID = ""S-1-5-21-1234567890-1234567890-1234567890-1234""
$objSID = New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier($SID)
$user = Get-ADUser -Filter { ObjectSID -eq $objSID }
