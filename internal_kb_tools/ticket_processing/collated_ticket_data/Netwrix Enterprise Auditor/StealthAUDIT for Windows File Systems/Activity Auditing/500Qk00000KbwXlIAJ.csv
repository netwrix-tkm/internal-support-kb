Tried to add the Output file to the server path but unable to retrieve data.","","","","-reviewed the configuration of the Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM) agent being used to audit NAS device
-found that NAM was configured correctly and successfully collecting events. 

This issue was with the configuration of FSAC System Scan job in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA). The job was trying to target the agent server, but we needed it to target the NAS server instead.

Once we corrected the host list the job was using, it started working

-NEA successfully collected the FSAC data from the NAS device
-also ran the File Deletions job as a test, and it seemed to return good data.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Joshua Sexton","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Activity Auditing","11.6","","22.0","Closed - Resolved","Excellus Health Plan, Inc.","Gary Bender","2025-01-14T19:11:03.000Z","2025-02-05T19:38:45.000Z"
