Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 
Here is a meeting recap:

The FSAC scan for FC06 host and FC02 host was displaying the following warning:
Error: Ini section for FC06 does not exist in ini file C:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSACSBTFileMon.ini

After inspecting the FC06 and FC02 hosts in Monitored Hosts of Activity Monitor console we saw that ""report the hostname as:"" setting was set to FQDN.
This means that while Stealh Audit was looking for the FC06 hostname the Activity Monitor was reporting the FC06 host via FQDN, such as fc06.example.domain.
As a result, the SBTFileMon.ini configuration file had incorrect entry for the FC06 host and File System activity log collection could not continue. 

To resolve this, we changed the ""report the hostname as:"" setting to NETBIOS name in Monitored Hosts of Activity Monitor console for hosts FC06 and FC02.
The Activity Monitor is now reporting FC06 and FC02 hosts using just ""FC06"" and ""FC02"", without the domain part.

After this the FSAC job was able to complete successfully for FC06 file server.

However, FSAC job failed to complete for FC02 with the following error:
Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: GetSessions failed with code 0x80004005
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.ActivityScanTask.InternalProcessRecord()
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()

To continue troubleshooting this error I`ve created a separate ticket for you: 00427524 - 1_FSAC_SystemScans for FC02 is failing with ""Unable to start scan""

As we discussed, since this error was resolved:
Error: Ini section for %hostname% does not exist in ini file C:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSACSBTFileMon.ini
we will close this ticket 00427477 - Errors on hosts. 

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return.
In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did.  Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
