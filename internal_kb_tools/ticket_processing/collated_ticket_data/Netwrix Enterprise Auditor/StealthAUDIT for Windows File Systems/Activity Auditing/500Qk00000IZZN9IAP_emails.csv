Hi Michael,

Ian is out sick today and I am taking this meeting in order to assist you.

Are you in the meeting room and trying to get into the meeting?

I may have to send you a new Zoom meeting from this case.

Hi Ian,

A network shared drive, also we have the activity monitoring agent installed on many of our file servers. I believe the past 30 days. If you can provide a scheduler so I can schedule our meeting. Thanks

Hello Michael,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From your description it looks like you need to find a file or folder that was deleted and details around the deletion.

Can you please tell me what type of file system the deleted item resided on and if you know the rough time frame of the deletion?


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Thank you for meeting with us today. Unfortunately, it looks like SA was erroring due to a misconfigured path in SAM for the host in question so we were unable to recover the deletion you were looking for. However, we corrected this issue for this SDC-FILESRVR50 by adding the rest of the directory to the path:
SBTFileMon_Logs<SERVER_NAME>_Log_.tsv     to     C:Program FilesStealthbitsStealthAUDITFSACSBTFileMon_Logs<SERVER_NAME>_Log_.tsv

We also enabled ""Report UNC path"" in the file output settings. 

I've gone ahead and opened the ticket for the upgrades, so keep an eye out for an email to schedule our pre-flight session!

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri
