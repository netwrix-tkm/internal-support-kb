The task File System - 0. Collection - 2. Activity Scans - FSAC System Scans is finished with Warning but we cannot see any users activity on the file servers. 

To see the activity we go to Netwrix Access Information Center but there is no activity logs. Can we check why is this happening ?","","","","Expired license for NAM","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Ilya Kotov","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Activity Auditing","11.6","","0.9","Closed - Resolved","Toyota Boshoku","TBEU ITSupport","2024-07-23T12:35:59.000Z","2024-07-24T10:06:56.000Z"
