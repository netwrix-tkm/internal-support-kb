Hello Glenda,

I do have a meeting on my calendar at that time, but it looks odd so I think the link may have not worked correctly.

Try the link below and lets see if it works better for you.

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into why some SQL servers are not allowing login.
We found that one server was not listening on the correct ports and we fixed this.
We are still looking into why the remote logins are failing when the work locally.

Below is a link to schedule the next meeting so we can continue looking into this.

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified SQL scanning was running and data is starting to populate.
There are a few outstanding issues, including at least 1 server we need to get permissions to for the SQL scans.

We also applied the new license and spoke about licensing the AD permissions module.
Our next steps are:
You will:
Create the new Activity Monitor server.
Get access to the remaining SQL database servers.
Speak with Tim to see if he wants to move forward with the AD Permissions module license.

To follow up on our conversation about the license, I have attached a new license to this email.
If you could get this to the new server we'll get it applied tomorrow during our meeting.

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Configured the Active Directory jobs to run on a schedule as they appear to be working as expected.
Migrated and configured the SQL server job to run.

I also looked into the AD permissions analyzer and it looks like you are not licensed for the module. Its possible at some point there was a trial licence or something to that effect. I've let your account manager know that you would like to use that module again and he will work with you and Tim to get that licensed so we can configure it again.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Prepare a new acitivy monitor server for migration.
Below are the requirements for the Activity monitor server so we can migrate it off of your 2016 server.

I think we should double check that today in our meeting. Now that I'm thinking about it I wonder if I didn't change the day to the 3rd and so it never triggered.

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Checked on errors generated during the file system scans. No immediately alarming errors are present and most seem to point to a know access issue with a new server.
Migrated the database and log files on the database server to the correct drives and verified access.
Verified that AIC is seeing information and could still access information after DB migration.
Setup Active Directory job, we expect this to fail as we were not able to fully configure it but this will help point us to any possible problems that may exist.
Our next steps are:
You will:
Upload the log file from the File System job to the ticket.
I will:
Verify steps needed to migrate the temdb to the correct location.

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Configured the file server scans and setup the schedule to run these scans.
We started some of the scans to verify that the scans are able to start with no errors.
Our next steps are:
You will:
Verify access to the file server that failed as we were unable to reach any shares in this server from the new NEA server.
Check on the jobs after the holiday to make sure we are seeing either ""warning"" or ""success"" on the jobs.

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Installed and configured the Sensitive Data Discovery module and the Access information center.
We verified that the Access information center is getting information.
We setup a file server host list and setup file scans to start using this server list.
Our next steps are:
You will:
Generate a certificate and key to be used for TLS security if this is needed for the web interfaces of NEA and AIC.
I will:
Prepare for the next meeting where we will integrate NEA with Activity Monitor to start getting activity information.
If possible we will also start setup on the file server scans.

Hello Glenda,

That's great news! I'm going to keep our ticket open for the hosts cleanup until we're done just to be sure we don't need to backtrack.
Lets keep an eye on everything and assuming nothing changes we'll just plan on moving forward with our configuration plan in our next meeting.

Below is the link the schedule our next meeting.

Hi Glenda,

Here is a link to schedule another meeting. I'd like to look at the NEA environment and get some backups of files to prepare to assist in setup of the new system.

Subject: RE: File System Activity - Data Retention [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Idmoq:ref ]

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the FSAC data not displaying properly in the reports and AIC.
We verified that NAM was running correctly and that the retention and scan settings were not creating a scenario where we may be missing data.

We checked the database to see what data was present, we could see data going back well beyond the 90 day retention policy, and as recent as the 11th of December.
The data from the 11th though was not matching what was expected, we saw 4 hosts reporting file system activity, but there should be more than 4 being monitored.

I do have some suspicion that the data retention is somehow tied to the host cleanup that is also becoming problematic. We determined that since you wanted to upgrade the OS on your NEA and SQL systems, we could deploy a parallel system to get a clean set of data. This will allow you to work with the product and get the data, or will help narrow down the possible failure points we may be experiencing with a clean setup.

Below is the documents that detail the requirements for a new SQL server and a new NEA server for our parallel test.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Overview.htm

Our next steps are:
You will:
Provision new systems to run a clean SQL database and a clean NEA/AIC setup.
Please get these systems ready and we can assist with the deployment of the applications.
I will:
Once the servers are ready, I will assist with deployment and setup to get a new baseline of the FSAC to ensure that the data being collected is correct and not being impacted by any previous settings are instance of NEA that may be affecting the current system.



Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer
