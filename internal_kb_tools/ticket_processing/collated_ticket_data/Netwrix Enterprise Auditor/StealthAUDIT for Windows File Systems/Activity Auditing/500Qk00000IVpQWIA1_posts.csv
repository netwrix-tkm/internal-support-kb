Windows File server FC02 

FSAC scan is failing with:
Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: GetSessions failed with code 0x80004005
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.ActivityScanTask.InternalProcessRecord()
   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute

query settings:
Applet launch mechanism ""MS Task Scheduler"" 

Scan server selection:
Automatic

Checked both FC02 and Stealth Audit server for lingering StealthauditRPC process - there is no such process on either of these machines. 

As such, it seems like the issue might be caused by the lack of permissions for the File System Applet mode scan on the FC02.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2024-11-19T15:49:23.000Z"

please, review this article and make sure that the same permissions are provided to the account specified in Connection Profile that is used by 1_FSAC_SystemScans job:
Applet Mode Permissions
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/AppletModePermissions.htm
The Connection Profile should be assigned under the FileSystem > 0.Collection jobâ€™s Properties window on the Connection tab.

To continue, very that the following port requirements are met between the StealthAudit Server and the FC02 server:

As a workaround to the issue at hand I would also suggest switching the ""Scan Server selection"" to ""Local server"". You can set this setting by navigating down this path:
1_FSAC_SystemScans> Configure> Queries > Right-Click Activity Scan Query > select properties > Click ""Configure"" > set Scan Server selection to Local Server 
Run the 1_FSAC_SystemScans after changing this setting to test if Local Server scan option is working correctly for the FC02 server and let me know the results.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2024-11-19T16:19:02.000Z"
