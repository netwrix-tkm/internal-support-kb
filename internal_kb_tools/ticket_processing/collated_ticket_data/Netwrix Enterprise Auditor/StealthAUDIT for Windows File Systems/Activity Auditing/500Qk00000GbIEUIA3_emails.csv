I am going to close this ticket as we have the new direction for that old data.

I'll open a fresh one so we can work on getting that old Agent data that we couldn't import into the Database and send a link for you.

Thanks,

You could check on the proxy. It should also have a copy of the FSAA folder and Servername.

There could be a suspend file there holding it up.

Also reminder you have to delete the other T2 file
 

Remove servername_activity.fsaadb and any activity.fsaadb.old files located in the FSAA Tier 2 directory.

Hi Nick,

 

I am unable to get the older scans to get pulled in.  Is there another location other than the suspend file that the beginning data would need to be set ?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Worked with Gary more today about getting the log data into a table. 

We will revisit.  He will give his dba a shot to take a peek. I'll see if I can do it in my lab as well.
