-client had some audio issue
-called in to meeting
-getting started at 8:08PM EDT

checking on current status of FSAC job
Nick is taking control

looking at logs

found error """"there is no row at position zero""
looking at log before error, it seems to be finding the file on proxy as expected

looking at T2s
""looks clean""

looking at NAM
-looks like Activity is writing to proxy
=as expected

looking for data on the proxy
lots of old installs
currently on D:stealthbitsstealthauditFSAASANAS01

only 75GB available on the app server
the T2s on the proxy server are 40+GB each
-those are compressed
may be a storage space issue

trying manually copy the T2s

still getting the same error

this file server was used before by an old instance of NEA
was on a different domain
I could be that the old data is messing with the new instance trying to copy the new data

checking SQL for any FSAA or FSAC data from that server:
-nothing
dropping data from that host from SQL sb
-already had dropdata instant job created

renaming T2 folder on proxy and application server to SANAS01_OLD

running job again
this time its working!

client needs to let it run and let us know if it finishes","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-09-20T20:03:44.000Z","2024-09-20T20:03:44.000Z","false","false"
