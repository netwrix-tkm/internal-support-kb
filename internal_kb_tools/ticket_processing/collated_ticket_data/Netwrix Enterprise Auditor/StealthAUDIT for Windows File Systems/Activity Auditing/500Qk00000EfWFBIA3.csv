After upgrade, we have discovered one more issue - we cannot succesfuly run FSAC jobs to collect logs from file servers. Please, look on the screen with error and also in the logs. I think it is something with certificate exchange. We target cluster name of this DFS (PLORDFS), but then nodes are discovered PLODFS01 and PLODFS02. Maybe this requires some special config?

Regards,
Adam Rudnicki","","","","Issue
