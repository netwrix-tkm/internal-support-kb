This issue can be resolved as described in this KB article:
Error: Ini Section Does Not Exist in SBTFileMon.ini | Knowledge | Salesforce","Support suggested scheduling a meeting with customer because KB describes multiple root causes and is not user friendly.","Issue:
The FSAC scan for FC06 host and FC02 host was displaying the following warning:
Error: Ini section for FC06 does not exist in ini file C:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSACSBTFileMon.ini

Symptoms:
As per this KB:
https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/General__kav/ka0Qk00000056w1IAA/view?ws=%2Flightning%2Fr%2FCase%2F500Qk00000IVIG1IAP%2Fview
this issue is caused by ""The name of the monitored host in Netwrix Activity Monitor mismatches the expected name.""

After inspecting the FC06 and FC02 hosts in Monitored Hosts of Activity Monitor console we saw that ""report the hostname as:"" setting was set to FQDN.
This means that while Stealh Audit was looking for the FC06 hostname the Activity Monitor was reporting the FC06 host via FQDN, such as fc06.example.domain.
As a result, the SBTFileMon.ini configuration file had incorrect entry for the FC06 host and File System activity log collection could not continue. 

Solution:
To resolve this, we changed the ""report the hostname as:"" setting to NETBIOS name in Monitored Hosts of Activity Monitor console for hosts FC06 and FC02.
The Activity Monitor is now reporting FC06 and FC02 hosts using just ""FC06"" and ""FC02"", without the domain part.

After this the FSAC job was able to complete successfully for FC06 file server.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Artem Naskal","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Activity Auditing","11.0","","0.3","Closed - Resolved","Bolton NHS Foundation Trust","Mohammed Oomer","2024-11-19T09:17:08.000Z","2024-11-19T15:45:23.000Z"
