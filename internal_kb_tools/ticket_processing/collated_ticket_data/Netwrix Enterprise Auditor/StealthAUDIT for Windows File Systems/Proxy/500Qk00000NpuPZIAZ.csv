"500Qk00000NpuPZIAZ","00441375","Support Ticket","Can't install 'File System Scanning Proxy'","I recently upgraded from v11.6 to v12 of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. Following the upgrade instructions, I tried to run the 'FS_UpdateProxy' instant job. It failed, almost instantly, with a weird 'key' error message. 

Following the manual update instructions, I uninstalled the proxy from my Proxy Servers. Unfortunately, I can't reinstall it. The installer gets to a screen that asks for my license, then says 'can't find license' and fails. I don't even see this within the installation instructions on Netwrix website. I am trying to install onto systems running Server Core (no UI), so even if I click 'browse', the installer crashes and I can't change the license path.

What license do I use to run the installer? How do I pass that as a command line argument if I can't use the 'browse' button? Am I being asked for a license in error? Would there be a broken Registry entry, or similar, which is causing me to see this screen? 

The installer I'm running is: 
""<a href='https://auditor-enterprise-FileSystemProxy-12.0.0.1030.msi' target='_blank'>auditor-enterprise-FileSystemProxy-12.0.0.1030.msi</a>""

Just in trying to troubleshoot by myself, I coped '<a href='https://StealthAudit.lic' target='_blank'>StealthAudit.lic</a>' from my Enterprise Auditor installation directory so that it's in the same folder as the installer .msi. 

Unfortunately, since I uninstalled the old Proxy to upgrade, my proxies aren't functional now.","","NAA v12.0 - Silent Installer Option for Proxy
