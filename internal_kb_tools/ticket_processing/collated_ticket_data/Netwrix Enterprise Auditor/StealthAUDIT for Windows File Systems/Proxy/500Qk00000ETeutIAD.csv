No error messages in logs/messages sections.  Just shows jobs ran for 0 seconds (even though I watched it run for an hour) and produces no results.","","","","Splitting the Scan Credential(s) into separate jobs.
Noted the following 
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm

Built out the schedule for one of the file servers.

When using multiple Proxy host for the same File servers it is recommended to use the following:
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Data Collectors > FileSystemAccess Data Collector > FSAA: Applet Settings >> Strong proxy affinity (only run scans on last proxy to scan host, unless no longer in proxy host list)
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/AppletSettings.htm

Set the old domain to scan via MSTask Task Scheduler https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/AppletSettings.htm
 
and Automatic (Local for NAS device hosts, Remote for Windows hosts) â€“ Applet is deployed to all targeted Windows servers. Other targeted devices, for example NAS, are scanned locally by the Enterprise Auditor Console server.
