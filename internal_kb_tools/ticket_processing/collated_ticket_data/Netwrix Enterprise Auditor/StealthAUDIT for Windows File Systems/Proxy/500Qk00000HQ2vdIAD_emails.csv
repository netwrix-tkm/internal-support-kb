Hi Saqib,

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.
And The debug was already on.
So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hi Saqib,



The job apparently didn’t finish successfully using the SG proxy.



[cid:image004.png@01DB2F69.D96D6BA0]



As the next try ,  I install FSAA proxy agent in MY0108CDS01 , but now it is going back to the previous error message



[cid:image005.png@01DB2F69.D96D6BA0]





Please advise.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm__;!!Kjv0uj3L4nM6H-I!kfA1IqeJYOED1D-FWnpF7KMjWhfQQ33H4_TyOiaXSeW2FdbeTuHaUXiXrJz7ArapHhwr76ld0Rc5HHf83A$>

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.


[cid:image007.png@01DB2F69.D96D6BA0]


2. In the opened window, click on Configure.

[cid:image008.png@01DB2F69.D96D6BA0]


3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?



please advise.

I now left the zoom meeting since you are not there.

Here is the last status I have :

  *   The job is now running successfully for the NASUNI but still failed for the windows file server (which is also acting as the proxy server)

Hi Saqib,

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.
And The debug was already on.
So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

As the next try ,  I install FSAA proxy agent in MY0108CDS01 , but now it is going back to the previous error message

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm__;!!Kjv0uj3L4nM6H-I!kfA1IqeJYOED1D-FWnpF7KMjWhfQQ33H4_TyOiaXSeW2FdbeTuHaUXiXrJz7ArapHhwr76ld0Rc5HHf83A$>

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.


[cid:image018.png@01DB2F6B.F6623900]


2. In the opened window, click on Configure.

[cid:image019.png@01DB2F6B.F6623900]


3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?



please advise.

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

 



 

Best Regards,

Sherry Lie

Hi Saqib,

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.
And The debug was already on.
So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hi Saqib,



The job apparently didn’t finish successfully using the SG proxy.



[cid:image006.png@01DB2F6E.44300F70]



As the next try ,  I install FSAA proxy agent in MY0108CDS01 , but now it is going back to the previous error message



[cid:image007.png@01DB2F6E.44300F70]





Please advise.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm__;!!Kjv0uj3L4nM6H-I!kfA1IqeJYOED1D-FWnpF7KMjWhfQQ33H4_TyOiaXSeW2FdbeTuHaUXiXrJz7ArapHhwr76ld0Rc5HHf83A$>

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.


[cid:image009.png@01DB2F6E.44300F70]


2. In the opened window, click on Configure.

[cid:image010.png@01DB2F6E.44300F70]


3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?



please advise.

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

 

Best Regards,

Hi Saqib,

 

The job apparently didn’t finish successfully using the SG proxy.

 



 

As the next try ,  I install FSAA proxy agent in MY0108CDS01 , but now it is going back to the previous error message

 



 

 

Please advise.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

Hi Saqib,

I now left the zoom meeting since you are not there.

Here is the last status I have :

  1.  The job is now running successfully for the NASUNI but still failed for the windows file server (which is also acting as the proxy server)

Hi Saqib,

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.
And The debug was already on.
So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

The job apparently didn’t finish successfully using the SG proxy.



[cid:image007.png@01DB2F70.1876C0C0]



As the next try ,  I install FSAA proxy agent in MY0108CDS01 , but now it is going back to the previous error message

Please advise.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm__;!!Kjv0uj3L4nM6H-I!kfA1IqeJYOED1D-FWnpF7KMjWhfQQ33H4_TyOiaXSeW2FdbeTuHaUXiXrJz7ArapHhwr76ld0Rc5HHf83A$>

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.


[cid:image010.png@01DB2F70.1876C0C0]


2. In the opened window, click on Configure.

[cid:image011.png@01DB2F70.1876C0C0]


3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?



please advise.

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:

Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.
And The debug was already on.
So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Best Regards,
Sherry Lie

As the next try ,  I install FSAA proxy agent in MY0108CDS01 , but now it is going back to the previous error message

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm__;!!Kjv0uj3L4nM6H-I!kfA1IqeJYOED1D-FWnpF7KMjWhfQQ33H4_TyOiaXSeW2FdbeTuHaUXiXrJz7ArapHhwr76ld0Rc5HHf83A$>

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.


[cid:image010.png@01DB2F71.28331D50]


2. In the opened window, click on Configure.

[cid:image011.png@01DB2F71.28331D50]


3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i. e. , Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this



 


Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

 



 

Best Regards,

Sherry Lie

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i. e. , Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this



 


Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

 



 

Best Regards,

Sherry Lie

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i. e. , Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this



 


Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hi Saqib,

 

The job apparently didn’t finish successfully using the SG proxy.

 



 

As the next try ,  I install FSAA proxy agent in MY0108CDS01 , but now it is going back to the previous error message

 



 

 

Please advise.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

Sherry Lie

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/ActivityMonitor_6.0/page/Content/SAM/Monitored_Hosts/Add_Host/Windows.htm*:*:text=Volume*20Shadow*20Copy,option*20is*20enabled*20by*20default.__;I34lJSUlJSU!!Kjv0uj3L4nM6H-I!i_gzqkMZBfRq_a1a0bl2Bj0nUpchBED3Qrtouh0jb5a-Z-BalKMsCmjdzv7IAHegPjO9wFwXvvE3yZpNUg$>

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Hi Saqib,

I now left the zoom meeting since you are not there.

Here is the last status I have :

  1.  The job is now running successfully for the NASUNI but still failed for the windows file server (which is also acting as the proxy server)

Hi Saqib,

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.
And The debug was already on.
So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

As the next try ,  I install FSAA proxy agent in MY0108CDS01 , but now it is going back to the previous error message

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm__;!!Kjv0uj3L4nM6H-I!kfA1IqeJYOED1D-FWnpF7KMjWhfQQ33H4_TyOiaXSeW2FdbeTuHaUXiXrJz7ArapHhwr76ld0Rc5HHf83A$>

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.


[cid:image012.png@01DB3451.889345F0]


2. In the opened window, click on Configure.

[cid:image013.png@01DB3451.889345F0]


3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?



please advise.

Hi Saqib,

 

Sorry for the late response.

The jobs seem to work fine now for few times,  but then the last job seems to have a warning on license.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i. e. , Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this



 


Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

 

Best Regards,

Sherry Lie

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

Hi Saqib,

 

Sorry for the late response.

The jobs seem to work fine now for few times,  but then the last job seems to have a warning on license.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i. e. , Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this



 


Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

Sherry Lie

Sorry for the late response.

The jobs seem to work fine now for few times,  but then the last job seems to have a warning on license.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/ActivityMonitor_6.0/page/Content/SAM/Monitored_Hosts/Add_Host/Windows.htm*:*:text=Volume*20Shadow*20Copy,option*20is*20enabled*20by*20default.__;I34lJSUlJSU!!Kjv0uj3L4nM6H-I!i_gzqkMZBfRq_a1a0bl2Bj0nUpchBED3Qrtouh0jb5a-Z-BalKMsCmjdzv7IAHegPjO9wFwXvvE3yZpNUg$>

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer.

Hi Saqib,



I now left the zoom meeting since you are not there.



Here is the last status I have :

  1.  The job is now running successfully for the NASUNI but still failed for the windows file server (which is also acting as the proxy server)

Hi Saqib,



To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm__;!!Kjv0uj3L4nM6H-I!kfA1IqeJYOED1D-FWnpF7KMjWhfQQ33H4_TyOiaXSeW2FdbeTuHaUXiXrJz7ArapHhwr76ld0Rc5HHf83A$>

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Saqib,



The instruction is not clear for me on the certificate part.

Can we have a session ?

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.


[cid:8d376049-49db-4398-b3c1-43d0ced96d79@Image_11_]


2. In the opened window, click on Configure.

[cid:2407508a-9cbb-4e24-b572-c541ccc94200@Image_12_]


3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?



please advise.

Sorry for the late response.

The jobs seem to work fine now for few times,  but then the last job seems to have a warning on license.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i. e. , Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this



 


Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

 

Best Regards,

Sherry Lie

Hi Saqib,

 

The job apparently didn’t finish successfully using the SG proxy.

 



 

As the next try ,  I install FSAA proxy agent in MY0108CDS01 , but now it is going back to the previous error message

 



 

 

Please advise.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

Hi Sherry,

It is usually a warning message that goes away on the next scan and does not impact the scan itself unless it is followed by another unrelated error.

Hi Saqib,

 

Sorry for the late response.

The jobs seem to work fine now for few times,  but then the last job seems to have a warning on license.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Saqib Sharif

Hi Sherry, It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i. e. , Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this



 


Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

The instruction is not clear for me on the certificate part.

Can we have a session ?

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.

 



 

Best Regards,

Sherry Lie

Hi Sherry,

It is usually a warning message that goes away on the next scan and does not impact the scan itself unless it is followed by another unrelated error.

Sorry for the late response.

The jobs seem to work fine now for few times,  but then the last job seems to have a warning on license.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/ActivityMonitor_6.0/page/Content/SAM/Monitored_Hosts/Add_Host/Windows.htm*:*:text=Volume*20Shadow*20Copy,option*20is*20enabled*20by*20default.__;I34lJSUlJSU!!Kjv0uj3L4nM6H-I!i_gzqkMZBfRq_a1a0bl2Bj0nUpchBED3Qrtouh0jb5a-Z-BalKMsCmjdzv7IAHegPjO9wFwXvvE3yZpNUg$>

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Hi Saqib,



I now left the zoom meeting since you are not there.



Here is the last status I have :

  1.  The job is now running successfully for the NASUNI but still failed for the windows file server (which is also acting as the proxy server)

Hi Saqib,



To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

The job apparently didn’t finish successfully using the SG proxy.

As the next try ,  I install FSAA proxy agent in MY0108CDS01 , but now it is going back to the previous error message

Please advise.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm__;!!Kjv0uj3L4nM6H-I!kfA1IqeJYOED1D-FWnpF7KMjWhfQQ33H4_TyOiaXSeW2FdbeTuHaUXiXrJz7ArapHhwr76ld0Rc5HHf83A$>

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for the quick reply.

Is that “MY0108CDS01”  the server where I have to clear the certificate ?

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.


[cid:image012.png@01DB39AB.65B679D0]


2. In the opened window, click on Configure.

[cid:image013.png@01DB39AB.65B679D0]


3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,



Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?



please advise.

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved. The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Symptom
You were observing an error with FSAC scan ""Cannot Initialize Scan with Proxy Host Supplied ...."". Later on, you saw a warning message with the FSAC Bulk Import job that there is no data to be imported.

Resolution
The proxy host supplied did not have the FSAA_Proxy.exe installed. When we selected a different proxy server, the error was gone and the scan was running fine. However, later you installed the FSAA_Proxy executable on the first host. The next error we saw was a warning message from the FSAC Bulk Import job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must always be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import job. Otherwise, the data will not be imported for viewing. We also modified settings in Netwrix Activity Monitor to exclude VSS for a host so that warning messages would go away.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry,

It is usually a warning message that goes away on the next scan and does not impact the scan itself unless it is followed by another unrelated error.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
verified and discussed the errors you were observing in the FSAC System Scan Job and FSAC Bulk Import Job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import Job so that StealthAudit can import data and it is available for viewing in Reports/Access Information Center. We also saw a warning related to VSS in the StealthAudit Console. Since StealthAudit does not process VSS, we disabled the VSS scanning in Stealthbits Activity Monitor. I am also attaching a link to the KB article we followed:

Windows Host

Our next steps are:
You will:
continue to monitor the job status.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry,

It appears that you have run the FSAC Bulk Import job containing all the hosts. These are warning messages only. Do you have a dedicated FSAC Bulk Import job for these two hosts i.e., Nasuni and Windows host? We can troubleshoot this over a meeting session as well if you prefer. Please use the link shared in my earlier email.

Here is the last status I have :


	The job is now running successfully for the NASUNI but still failed for the windows file server (which is also acting as the proxy server)

Hi Saqib,

 

To keep it standard,  I will stick to the local proxy where I already installed the FSAA proxy in the MY server.

And The debug was already on.  

So I grab the debug file from yesterday and uploaded to the ticket in the portal.

 

Best Regards,

Sherry Lie

Please advise.

Hello Sherry,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
troubleshooted the issue you were facing when running FSAC scan against a Nasuni appliance. We checked the existing Proxy server defined in the job and found out that mentioned server didn't had the Proxy applet installed. During the discussion, you mentioned that you were using a different proxy server for FSAA scans. We used that proxy server in StealthAudit console and the FSAC scan started to run. You also mentioned that Windows Host mentioned in the same job was not functional. We assigned permissions using this KB article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem/ProxyModeServicePermissions.htm

Since the job was taking time to run, we agreed that you will let it run and let me know about the status.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job and let me know if there is any error.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow and share a meeting schedule if required.

Have a great day!

Hi Sherry, Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. 



 


Hi Sherry,

Proxy server is the Windows Server which has FSAA proxy executable installed. This server is instructed by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit) to collect logs on behalf of NEA server and once collected, send them to NEA server. You can verify if you have assigned any proxy server in the FSAC job settings. Please follow these steps to identify:

1. Navigate to the FSAC job -> Configure -> Queries and then click on Query Properties.
 



 



2. In the opened window, click on Configure.




 



3. In the next window, navigate to applet settings and see if you have selected the option ""Require Applet to be running as a service on target"".
4. In the left pane, click on Scan Server settings. In here, if you have a value set in ""Specific Remote Server"" or """"Specific Remote Servers by Host Lists"".

If in step 3 and 4, you have values set as mentioned then you are using a proxy server. The proxy server is defined in step 4.

Let me know if you need further information or assistance.



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib,

 

Thanks for following up on this.

So below is the instruction that I capture,   

we have the Stealth Audit console,  Activity Monitor server,  and the target host to scan.

I am always confuse which one is considered as “target proxy server” as per this instruction ?

 

please advise.
