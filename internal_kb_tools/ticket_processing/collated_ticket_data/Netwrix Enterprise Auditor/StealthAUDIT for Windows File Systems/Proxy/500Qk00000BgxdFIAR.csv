after updating the FSAA proxy (all 3 proxy servers) from 11.5 to 11.6 we have the following error message.

<a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA</a>.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied
   at <a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA</a>.AccessScanTask.InternalProcessRecord()
   at <a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task</a>.StartExecute()


I would like to ask for help or a solution.


Thanks.","","","","Changed the applet mechanism to ""Require applet to be running as a service on target (does not deploy or launch applet)"" from ""MSTask Task Scheduler"" in FSAA Query > Applet Settings","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Aleksandr Timofeev","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Proxy","11.6","","2.1","Closed - Resolved","Borbet GmbH","Waldemar Sartison","2024-06-11T06:58:00.000Z","2024-06-13T08:35:50.000Z"
