I get this message even though the previous bulk import shows Success.","Issues seems to have resulted from improper Scan completion (job termination) corrupting the Tier2 DBs.

Issues seems to have resulted from improper Scan completion (job termination) corrupting the Tier2 DBs.

Not able to actively replicate within a lab

The workaround for this issues was to complete the following 
1. Jobs > Z.Sandbox > FS_DropTables   << for only the 3. Drop FSDLP Tables
2. Jobs > FileSystem > 3.Prep > 0-Create Schema
3. Manually deleted the Ter 2 *DLP* (SQLite) DBs from the NEA FSSA path as well as the Proxy host FSAA folder path.","Product defect","Dusty Grayson","Error","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Proxy","11.6","89","168.1","Closed - Resolved","Hawaii Pacific Health","Steven Schiesl","2024-09-26T17:21:30.000Z","2025-03-13T20:20:51.000Z"
