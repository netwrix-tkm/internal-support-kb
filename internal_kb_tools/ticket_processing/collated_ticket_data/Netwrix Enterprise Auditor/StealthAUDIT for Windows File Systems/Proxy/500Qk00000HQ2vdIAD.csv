   at <a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task</a>.StartExecute()","","Customer is getting Proxy initialization error on FSAC jobs. It was determined during the call that they didn't setup the correct proxy server in the job settings and specified a server that didn't had the FSAA Proxy executable installed. Setting that to correct server resulted in successful execution of the job. However, the customer now wants to setup a different proxy and they are getting same errors.","The customer has been asked to verify the permissions and ports for proxy servers as per documentation.","The proxy host supplied did not have the FSAA_Proxy.exe installed. When we selected a different proxy server, the error was gone and the scan was running fine. However, later you installed the FSAA_Proxy executable on the first host. The next error we saw was a warning message from the FSAC Bulk Import job. We discussed that the FSAC Scan Job must always be followed by the FSAC Bulk Import job. Otherwise, the data will not be imported for viewing. We also modified settings in Netwrix Activity Monitor to exclude VSS for a host so that warning messages would go away.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Saqib Sharif","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Proxy","11.5","11.5.0.174","24.9","Closed - Resolved","Schlumberger Technology Corporation (SLB)","Sherry Lie","2024-10-24T06:57:56.000Z","2024-11-18T05:01:15.000Z"
