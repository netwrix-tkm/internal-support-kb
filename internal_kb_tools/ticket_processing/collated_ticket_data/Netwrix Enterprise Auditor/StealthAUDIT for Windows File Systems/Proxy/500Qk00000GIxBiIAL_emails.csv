Team,

Per our call today within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) and Proxy host for PALIMOMI noting that the scans Tuesday (failing) Thursday (completing) we then then followed our prior process.

Ram the following jobs
1. Jobs > Z.Sandbox > FS_DropTables   << for only the 3. Drop FSDLP Tables
2. Jobs > FileSystem > 3.Prep > 0-Create Schema
3. Manually deleted the Ter 2 *DLP* (SQLite) DBs from the NEA FSSA path as well as the Proxy host FSAA folder path.

Ernie2 noted that a DB on the Proxy was newer than on the NEA host looking at the files the only FSAADB file that did not have a matching date code was the _ProgresssFSAA.fsaadb this file was copied to the NEA host and the one in the FSAAHOST-NAME folder and the file was overwritten.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

After looking at it again, I don’t think HARBORCOURT is an issue.  I believe it was my fault.  Oops.  However, PALIMOMI is still on it’s Tue/Thur rotation.  The screenshot is from PALIMOMI.

 



 

And yes, PaliMomi has it’s own proxy.

Team, 

Thank You for the update.

How did our 2 host in question have a manual run like we did with Ernie2 reset?

Refresh me  these 2 servers HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI use their own Proxy correct?

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Steven – about when are we talking about having the console open?  I don’t think I used the console recently, but just wanted to make sure.

 

Thanks,

Amy

I’m pretty sure I only had one open.  Only thing I could think of is maybe Amy had one open too.  Don’t know anyone else who would be on that server.  Our ultimate goal is to get to full depth anyways so it’s not that big deal.  Just don’t know how it happened.

Steven,

Thank You for the update.

Did we reset these 2 servers (HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI) like we did with Ernie2?

As for the setting get unchecked where there by chance multiple NEA consoles loaded when the lower level scans were set?

Anecdotally I believe that I have seen this happen under the situation of multiple NEA consoles being open at the same time as they need to read the job’s xml files. This could be the same user or another user on the same host.

Please let me know if that was a possibility.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,

                Looks like there are 2 servers that quit after 4 seconds, HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI.  Also, I last had the depth set to around 6 or 8 deep. I found all the jobs are now showing depth of 25 and unchecked and greyed out.  How would this setting get unchecked?

Team,  

Per our last call within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) ran the Drop Data for the rest of the host that were on the same Proxy that Ernie2 was using.

We then manually deleted the Ter 2 (SQLite) DBs from the NEA FSSA path as well as the Proxy host FSAA folder path.

Ram the following jobs
Jobs > Z.Sandbox > FS_DropTables   << for only the 3. Drop FSDLP Tables
Jobs > FileSystem > 3.Prep >  0-Create Schema

Kicked of Zero level SDD scans for the host in question until we had all Successful.

Steven will re-increase the scan depth per his discretion and note any issues between the Tuesday and Thursday scans.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,

                I uploaded the data you asked for.  Checking the messages, it looks like the Tier 2 is not being copied to the Application server and is stating that the Tier 2 database on the proxy is newer, and is skipping the scan. The weird thing is, the scheduled scan failed on Monday & Wednesday. I then kicked it off manually from the scheduler on Wednesday and it scanned just fine.  Then this morning, the scheduled scan failed again. Looks like might just be an issue with the schedule scan not copying over the Tier 2 database.

Thank You for the update.

We might need a new case of this, however I would like to look at the details from that Job.
Enable Debug Logging
From the NEA Console > Settings > Application
Set Log Level to Debug
Rerun jobs that are failing to collect logs in full detail. Return Log level to warning afterwards.


Please provide logs from the following locations: 

Logs from the job form the Export option.
Example:
  
From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 
 

The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.
https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=my_tickets.html

Once the upload has completed reply to this email, so I know to pull the files.

Hi Dusty,

                Not sure what happened but it seems there’s an issue now with the DRF-ERNIE2 permissions scan.



 

I didn’t think to check it out before since we were only looking at the DLP scans. The errors on the scans are the normal ones we are used to seeing. But the 7-8 minutes scans are a little bit of a concern.

Hi Dusty,
                So far it looks like it's running good. Last time it had a bad scan was on 2/25.  The next scan for PALIMOMI is on Thursday.  I feel if that scan is successful, then this ticket can be closed.  I will give you an update on Thursday.

Team,

Per our call today within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) and Proxy host for PALIMOMI noting that the scans Tuesday (failing) Thursday (completing) we then then followed our prior process.

Ram the following jobs
1. Jobs > Z.Sandbox > FS_DropTables   << for only the 3. Drop FSDLP Tables
2. Jobs > FileSystem > 3.Prep > 0-Create Schema
3. Manually deleted the Ter 2 *DLP* (SQLite) DBs from the NEA FSSA path as well as the Proxy host FSAA folder path.

Ernie2 noted that a DB on the Proxy was newer than on the NEA host looking at the files the only FSAADB file that did not have a matching date code was the _ProgresssFSAA.fsaadb this file was copied to the NEA host and the one in the FSAAHOST-NAME folder and the file was overwritten.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

After looking at it again, I don't think HARBORCOURT is an issue.  I believe it was my fault.  Oops.  However, PALIMOMI is still on it's Tue/Thur rotation.  The screenshot is from PALIMOMI.

[cid:image003.png@01DB9273.1A6A25A0]

And yes, PaliMomi has it's own proxy.

Team,

Thank You for the update.

How did our 2 host in question have a manual run like we did with Ernie2 reset?

Refresh me  these 2 servers HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI use their own Proxy correct?

Hi Steven - about when are we talking about having the console open?  I don't think I used the console recently, but just wanted to make sure.

Thanks,

I'm pretty sure I only had one open.  Only thing I could think of is maybe Amy had one open too.  Don't know anyone else who would be on that server.  Our ultimate goal is to get to full depth anyways so it's not that big deal.  Just don't know how it happened.

Steven,

Thank You for the update.

Did we reset these 2 servers (HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI) like we did with Ernie2?

As for the setting get unchecked where there by chance multiple NEA consoles loaded when the lower level scans were set?

Anecdotally I believe that I have seen this happen under the situation of multiple NEA consoles being open at the same time as they need to read the job's xml files. This could be the same user or another user on the same host.

Please let me know if that was a possibility.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,
                Looks like there are 2 servers that quit after 4 seconds, HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI.  Also, I last had the depth set to around 6 or 8 deep. I found all the jobs are now showing depth of 25 and unchecked and greyed out.  How would this setting get unchecked?

Team,

Per our last call within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) ran the Drop Data for the rest of the host that were on the same Proxy that Ernie2 was using.

We then manually deleted the Ter 2 (SQLite) DBs from the NEA FSSA path as well as the Proxy host FSAA folder path.

Ram the following jobs
Jobs > Z.Sandbox > FS_DropTables   << for only the 3. Drop FSDLP Tables
Jobs > FileSystem > 3.Prep > 0-Create Schema

Kicked of Zero level SDD scans for the host in question until we had all Successful.

Steven will re-increase the scan depth per his discretion and note any issues between the Tuesday and Thursday scans.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,
                I uploaded the data you asked for.  Checking the messages, it looks like the Tier 2 is not being copied to the Application server and is stating that the Tier 2 database on the proxy is newer, and is skipping the scan. The weird thing is, the scheduled scan failed on Monday & Wednesday. I then kicked it off manually from the scheduler on Wednesday and it scanned just fine.  Then this morning, the scheduled scan failed again. Looks like might just be an issue with the schedule scan not copying over the Tier 2 database.

Hi Dusty,
                Not sure what happened but it seems there's an issue now with the DRF-ERNIE2 permissions scan.
[cid:image008.png@01DB9273.1A6A25A0]

I didn't think to check it out before since we were only looking at the DLP scans. The errors on the scans are the normal ones we are used to seeing. But the 7-8 minutes scans are a little bit of a concern.

Hi Dusty,

                So far it looks like it’s running good. Last time it had a bad scan was on 2/25.  The next scan for PALIMOMI is on Thursday.  I feel if that scan is successful, then this ticket can be closed.  I will give you an update on Thursday.

Team,

Per our call today within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) and Proxy host for PALIMOMI noting that the scans Tuesday (failing) Thursday (completing) we then then followed our prior process.

Ram the following jobs
1. Jobs > Z.Sandbox > FS_DropTables   << for only the 3. Drop FSDLP Tables
2. Jobs > FileSystem > 3.Prep > 0-Create Schema
3. Manually deleted the Ter 2 *DLP* (SQLite) DBs from the NEA FSSA path as well as the Proxy host FSAA folder path.

Ernie2 noted that a DB on the Proxy was newer than on the NEA host looking at the files the only FSAADB file that did not have a matching date code was the _ProgresssFSAA.fsaadb this file was copied to the NEA host and the one in the FSAAHOST-NAME folder and the file was overwritten.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

After looking at it again, I don’t think HARBORCOURT is an issue.  I believe it was my fault.  Oops.  However, PALIMOMI is still on it’s Tue/Thur rotation.  The screenshot is from PALIMOMI.

 



 

And yes, PaliMomi has it’s own proxy.

Team, 

Thank You for the update.

How did our 2 host in question have a manual run like we did with Ernie2 reset?

Refresh me  these 2 servers HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI use their own Proxy correct?

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Steven – about when are we talking about having the console open?  I don’t think I used the console recently, but just wanted to make sure.

 

Thanks,

Amy

I’m pretty sure I only had one open.  Only thing I could think of is maybe Amy had one open too.  Don’t know anyone else who would be on that server.  Our ultimate goal is to get to full depth anyways so it’s not that big deal.  Just don’t know how it happened.

Steven,

Thank You for the update.

Did we reset these 2 servers (HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI) like we did with Ernie2?

As for the setting get unchecked where there by chance multiple NEA consoles loaded when the lower level scans were set?

Anecdotally I believe that I have seen this happen under the situation of multiple NEA consoles being open at the same time as they need to read the job’s xml files. This could be the same user or another user on the same host.

Please let me know if that was a possibility.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,

                Looks like there are 2 servers that quit after 4 seconds, HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI.  Also, I last had the depth set to around 6 or 8 deep. I found all the jobs are now showing depth of 25 and unchecked and greyed out.  How would this setting get unchecked?

Team,  

Per our last call within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) ran the Drop Data for the rest of the host that were on the same Proxy that Ernie2 was using.

We then manually deleted the Ter 2 (SQLite) DBs from the NEA FSSA path as well as the Proxy host FSAA folder path.

Ram the following jobs
Jobs > Z.Sandbox > FS_DropTables   << for only the 3. Drop FSDLP Tables
Jobs > FileSystem > 3.Prep >  0-Create Schema

Kicked of Zero level SDD scans for the host in question until we had all Successful.

Steven will re-increase the scan depth per his discretion and note any issues between the Tuesday and Thursday scans.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,

                I uploaded the data you asked for.  Checking the messages, it looks like the Tier 2 is not being copied to the Application server and is stating that the Tier 2 database on the proxy is newer, and is skipping the scan. The weird thing is, the scheduled scan failed on Monday & Wednesday. I then kicked it off manually from the scheduler on Wednesday and it scanned just fine.  Then this morning, the scheduled scan failed again. Looks like might just be an issue with the schedule scan not copying over the Tier 2 database.

Thank You for the update.

We might need a new case of this, however I would like to look at the details from that Job.
Enable Debug Logging
From the NEA Console > Settings > Application
Set Log Level to Debug
Rerun jobs that are failing to collect logs in full detail. Return Log level to warning afterwards.


Please provide logs from the following locations: 

Logs from the job form the Export option.
Example:
  
From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 
 

The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.
https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=my_tickets.html

Hi Dusty,

                Not sure what happened but it seems there’s an issue now with the DRF-ERNIE2 permissions scan.



 

I didn’t think to check it out before since we were only looking at the DLP scans. The errors on the scans are the normal ones we are used to seeing. But the 7-8 minutes scans are a little bit of a concern.

Hi Dusty,
                So far it looks like it's running good. Last time it had a bad scan was on 2/25.  The next scan for PALIMOMI is on Thursday.  I feel if that scan is successful, then this ticket can be closed.  I will give you an update on Thursday.

Team,

Per our call today within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) and Proxy host for PALIMOMI noting that the scans Tuesday (failing) Thursday (completing) we then then followed our prior process.

Ram the following jobs
1. Jobs > Z.Sandbox > FS_DropTables   << for only the 3. Drop FSDLP Tables
2. Jobs > FileSystem > 3.Prep > 0-Create Schema
3. Manually deleted the Ter 2 *DLP* (SQLite) DBs from the NEA FSSA path as well as the Proxy host FSAA folder path.

Ernie2 noted that a DB on the Proxy was newer than on the NEA host looking at the files the only FSAADB file that did not have a matching date code was the _ProgresssFSAA.fsaadb this file was copied to the NEA host and the one in the FSAAHOST-NAME folder and the file was overwritten.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

After looking at it again, I don't think HARBORCOURT is an issue.  I believe it was my fault.  Oops.  However, PALIMOMI is still on it's Tue/Thur rotation.  The screenshot is from PALIMOMI.

And yes, PaliMomi has it's own proxy.

Team,

Thank You for the update.

How did our 2 host in question have a manual run like we did with Ernie2 reset?

Refresh me  these 2 servers HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI use their own Proxy correct?

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Steven - about when are we talking about having the console open?  I don't think I used the console recently, but just wanted to make sure.

Thanks,

I'm pretty sure I only had one open.  Only thing I could think of is maybe Amy had one open too.  Don't know anyone else who would be on that server.  Our ultimate goal is to get to full depth anyways so it's not that big deal.  Just don't know how it happened.

________________________________

Steven,

Thank You for the update.

Did we reset these 2 servers (HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI) like we did with Ernie2?

As for the setting get unchecked where there by chance multiple NEA consoles loaded when the lower level scans were set?

Anecdotally I believe that I have seen this happen under the situation of multiple NEA consoles being open at the same time as they need to read the job's xml files. This could be the same user or another user on the same host.

Please let me know if that was a possibility.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,
                Looks like there are 2 servers that quit after 4 seconds, HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI.  Also, I last had the depth set to around 6 or 8 deep. I found all the jobs are now showing depth of 25 and unchecked and greyed out.  How would this setting get unchecked?

________________________________

Team,

Per our last call within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) ran the Drop Data for the rest of the host that were on the same Proxy that Ernie2 was using.

We then manually deleted the Ter 2 (SQLite) DBs from the NEA FSSA path as well as the Proxy host FSAA folder path.

Ram the following jobs
Jobs > Z.Sandbox > FS_DropTables   << for only the 3. Drop FSDLP Tables
Jobs > FileSystem > 3.Prep > 0-Create Schema

Kicked of Zero level SDD scans for the host in question until we had all Successful.

Steven will re-increase the scan depth per his discretion and note any issues between the Tuesday and Thursday scans.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,
                I uploaded the data you asked for.  Checking the messages, it looks like the Tier 2 is not being copied to the Application server and is stating that the Tier 2 database on the proxy is newer, and is skipping the scan. The weird thing is, the scheduled scan failed on Monday & Wednesday. I then kicked it off manually from the scheduler on Wednesday and it scanned just fine.  Then this morning, the scheduled scan failed again. Looks like might just be an issue with the schedule scan not copying over the Tier 2 database.

Hi Dusty,
                Not sure what happened but it seems there's an issue now with the DRF-ERNIE2 permissions scan.
[cid:image009.png@01DB9406.016C7000]

I didn't think to check it out before since we were only looking at the DLP scans. The errors on the scans are the normal ones we are used to seeing. But the 7-8 minutes scans are a little bit of a concern.

Hi Dusty,

                So far it looks like it’s running good. Last time it had a bad scan was on 2/25.  The next scan for PALIMOMI is on Thursday.  I feel if that scan is successful, then this ticket can be closed.  I will give you an update on Thursday.

Team,

Per our call today within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) and Proxy host for PALIMOMI noting that the scans Tuesday (failing) Thursday (completing) we then then followed our prior process.

Ram the following jobs
1. Jobs > Z.Sandbox > FS_DropTables   << for only the 3. Drop FSDLP Tables
2. Jobs > FileSystem > 3.Prep > 0-Create Schema
3. Manually deleted the Ter 2 *DLP* (SQLite) DBs from the NEA FSSA path as well as the Proxy host FSAA folder path.

Ernie2 noted that a DB on the Proxy was newer than on the NEA host looking at the files the only FSAADB file that did not have a matching date code was the _ProgresssFSAA.fsaadb this file was copied to the NEA host and the one in the FSAAHOST-NAME folder and the file was overwritten.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

After looking at it again, I don’t think HARBORCOURT is an issue.  I believe it was my fault.  Oops.  However, PALIMOMI is still on it’s Tue/Thur rotation.  The screenshot is from PALIMOMI.

 



 

And yes, PaliMomi has it’s own proxy.

Team, 

Thank You for the update.

How did our 2 host in question have a manual run like we did with Ernie2 reset?

Refresh me  these 2 servers HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI use their own Proxy correct?

Hi Steven – about when are we talking about having the console open?  I don’t think I used the console recently, but just wanted to make sure.

 

Thanks,

Amy

I’m pretty sure I only had one open.  Only thing I could think of is maybe Amy had one open too.  Don’t know anyone else who would be on that server.  Our ultimate goal is to get to full depth anyways so it’s not that big deal.  Just don’t know how it happened.

Steven,

Thank You for the update.

Did we reset these 2 servers (HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI) like we did with Ernie2?

As for the setting get unchecked where there by chance multiple NEA consoles loaded when the lower level scans were set?

Anecdotally I believe that I have seen this happen under the situation of multiple NEA consoles being open at the same time as they need to read the job’s xml files. This could be the same user or another user on the same host.

Please let me know if that was a possibility.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,

                Looks like there are 2 servers that quit after 4 seconds, HARBORCOURT & PALIMOMI.  Also, I last had the depth set to around 6 or 8 deep. I found all the jobs are now showing depth of 25 and unchecked and greyed out.  How would this setting get unchecked?

Team,  

Per our last call within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) ran the Drop Data for the rest of the host that were on the same Proxy that Ernie2 was using.

We then manually deleted the Ter 2 (SQLite) DBs from the NEA FSSA path as well as the Proxy host FSAA folder path.

Ram the following jobs
Jobs > Z.Sandbox > FS_DropTables   << for only the 3. Drop FSDLP Tables
Jobs > FileSystem > 3.Prep >  0-Create Schema

Kicked of Zero level SDD scans for the host in question until we had all Successful.

Steven will re-increase the scan depth per his discretion and note any issues between the Tuesday and Thursday scans.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,

                I uploaded the data you asked for.  Checking the messages, it looks like the Tier 2 is not being copied to the Application server and is stating that the Tier 2 database on the proxy is newer, and is skipping the scan. The weird thing is, the scheduled scan failed on Monday & Wednesday. I then kicked it off manually from the scheduler on Wednesday and it scanned just fine.  Then this morning, the scheduled scan failed again. Looks like might just be an issue with the schedule scan not copying over the Tier 2 database.

Rerun jobs that are failing to collect logs in full detail. Return Log level to warning afterwards.


Please provide logs from the following locations: 

Logs from the job form the Export option.

Hi Dusty,

                Not sure what happened but it seems there’s an issue now with the DRF-ERNIE2 permissions scan.



 

I didn’t think to check it out before since we were only looking at the DLP scans. The errors on the scans are the normal ones we are used to seeing. But the 7-8 minutes scans are a little bit of a concern.
