Post upgrade the SDD scans via the Proxies fail with the following ERROR:
1-**REDACTED** SEEK System Scans_Log.tsv
ERROR	FILESYSTEMACCESS	TFileSystemProcessor.RunFileSystemScan	""Error during processing:  StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data Components are not installed on
 
SDD_**REDACTED**ME2_2024_06_18_181221098_c295487b-bf58-47d1-9b80-e2e2086e7996_0.log
ERROR                       TFileSystemProcessor.RunFileSystemScan  ""Error during processing:  StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data Components are not installed on **REDACTED-PRXY""

The Proxy and SDD software have been correctly installed to the D: drive and the %sainstalldir% Environment variable  was added to the proxy host.

Desired Outcome:
For the Proxy to correctly ID that SDD is installed and preform the normal scanning functionality 

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the needed applications to a drive other than C: 
2. Run the related job


Reliably Repro'd in Customer Envi

Troubleshooting completed/Notes: 
1. Confirmed the Environment variable
    
2. Re-installed the SDD application 

3. Rebooted the Proxy host.

4. Re-run the SDD Job.

I can reproduce this error specifically by removing the referenced README.txt file from the location on the proxy. It does not appear that this file gets copied over during a scan, but it should be dropped in place during the install of the SDD Add-On on the proxy server. Somehow this file must be getting removed after the successful scan that occurred previously in customer's environment. 

Running Process Monitor during lab testing FSAAScanHost.EXE checks for the README.txt file when SEEK scan is initiated.

Lab testing if SDD add-on is not installed on FSAA proxy it does not produce the same error message observed in customer environment. The error messages outlined from my lab align with current documentation.
