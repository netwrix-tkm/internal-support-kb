Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

We changed the applet mechanism in Applet Settings to ""Require applet to be running as a service on target (does not deploy or launch applet)"" and reinstalled FSAA Proxy in one of the proxy servers.
We did the same for the FS SEEK scans.

Verified that the scans are working.

I will close this ticket from our end. If you have any questions please log a new ticket.

Best regards,
