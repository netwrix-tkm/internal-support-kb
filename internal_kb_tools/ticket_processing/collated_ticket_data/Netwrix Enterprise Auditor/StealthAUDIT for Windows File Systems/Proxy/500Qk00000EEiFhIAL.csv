DLP - Error initiating scan of file due to filename

I get a lot of errors from the DLP job because it is not able to read filenames. We have many people that use different characters (mostly Japanese) but I've noticed some filenames that are perfectly fine, but the error shows a ? instead and it throws an error. How can we get this resolved? My latest scan has over 1,000 files like this. Because of the Hawaiian language, many of them contain apostrophes. If Windows allows the file name, why can't DLP just read it? I am attaching an example of DLP not being able to recognize a simple ""i"".

Cause

Outdated proxy versions

Resolution

Upgraded proxies to the latest 11.6 version due to this issue being fixed in an update.
