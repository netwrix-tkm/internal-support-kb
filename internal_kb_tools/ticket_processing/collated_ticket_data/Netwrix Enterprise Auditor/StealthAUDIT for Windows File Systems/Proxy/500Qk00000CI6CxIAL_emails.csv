Could we get the following form the Proxy Servers?
Best if pasted into the edit window in an ADMIN PowerShell ISE session. Then Copy the text from the output window.

Clear-Host
$Servers = ""CHN-SHG-NW-PRXY"",""NLD-AMF-NW-PRXY"",""USA-RNC-NW-PRXY"",""SGP-SGP-NW-PRXY""

Foreach ($Server in $Servers){ 
""**** Checking Host $Server ****""
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $Server { 
$README_paths = gci ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA*README.txt"" -Recurse
""**** README_paths ****
$README_paths ""
Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Service -PipelineVariable Service  |Where-Object {($_.DisplayName -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.DisplayName -like ""Netwrix*"")}|
ForEach-Object {
    Get-Process -Id $_.ProcessId |
    Select-Object -Property @{label='Status';expression={$Service.State}},
                            @{label='DisplayName';expression={$Service.DisplayName}},
                            @{label='Log-on-AS';expression={$Service.StartName}},
                            @{label='Start_Up_Mode';expression={$Service.StartMode}},
                            StartTime
                            } |Sort-Object |Format-Table  Status, Start_Up_Mode, Name, StartTime, Log-on-AS -AutoSize 
                }
} 


If it is truly missing on any of the host we can pull it from NEA server path and place it where it is needed on the proxy host.
%sainstalldir%FSAASensitiveDatajdk-17.0.7+7-jreconfsecuritypolicy

Let's then run the jobs again to see if there same file is noted in the error.

Again, thank You for your time.

If it is truly missing on any of the host we can pull it from NEA server path and place it where it is needed on the proxy host.

Let's then run the jobs again to see if there same file is noted in the error.

If it is truly missing on any of the host we can pull it from NEA server path and place it where it is needed on the proxy host.
%sainstalldir%FSAASensitiveDatajdk-17.0.7+7-jreconfsecuritypolicy

Let's then run the jobs again to see if there same file is noted in the error.

Again, thank You for your time.

If it is truly missing on any of the host we can pull it from NEA server path and place it where it is needed on the proxy host.
%sainstalldir%FSAASensitiveDatajdk-17.0.7+7-jreconfsecuritypolicy

Let's then run the jobs again to see if there same file is noted in the error.

Again, thank You for your time.

If it is truly missing on any of the host we can pull it from NEA server path and place it where it is needed on the proxy host.

Let's then run the jobs again to see if there same file is noted in the error.

The scans this past weekend failed with the same error messages.

 

Can we schedule a call? I have figured out why this keeps happening weekly and need assistance.

Dusty,

 

Output from the main Enterprise Auditor server that does the ANA region:



 

Output from USA-RNC-NW-PRXY:



 

Output from NLD-AMF-NW-PRXY:



 

Output from SGP-SGP-NW-PRXY (even when run locally as an administrator):



 

Output from CHN-SHG-NW-PRXY (even when run locally as an administrator):



 

 

I then proceeded to copy the README.txt file from the main server to the same location in all four of the proxy servers:

 

Output from USA-RNC-NW-PRXY after copying to README.txt file to the server:



 

Output from NLD-AMF-NW-PRXY after copying to README.txt file to the server:

Output from CHN-SHG-NW-PRXY after copying to README.txt file to the server (even when run locally as an administrator):



 

 

I started the proxy sensitive data scans again and they are all working on the first try:

Stephen,

Clear-Host
$Servers = ""CHN-SHG-NW-PRXY"",""NLD-AMF-NW-PRXY"",""USA-RNC-NW-PRXY"",""SGP-SGP-NW-PRXY""

Foreach ($Server in $Servers){

Invoke-Command -ComputerName $Server { 
$README_paths = gci ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA*README.txt"" -Recurse

    Select-Object -Property @{label='Status';expression={$Service.State} },
                            @{label='DisplayName';expression={$Service.DisplayName} },

                }
} 


If it is truly missing on any of the host we can pull it from NEA server path and place it where it is needed on the proxy host.
%sainstalldir%FSAASensitiveDatajdk-17.0.7+7-jreconfsecuritypolicy

Let's then run the jobs again to see if there same file is noted in the error.

Again, thank You for your time.

Per our call today we looked that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) 11.6.0.79

It was found that the Log Maintenance that is used to clean up the Proxy FSAA logs was also removing the Log Maintenance README.txt file from the Proxy host. 

To correct this, we removed the '.txt' from the Save Last Analysis the noted txt files are not longer getting added to the 1-LogCleanup table so the 2-DeleteFiles should no longer reference for the 

foreach ($i in $input) {
  Remove-Item -path $i.PathAndName

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

The scans this past weekend failed with the same error messages.

 

Can we schedule a call? I have figured out why this keeps happening weekly and need assistance.

Dusty,

 

Output from the main Enterprise Auditor server that does the ANA region:



 

Output from USA-RNC-NW-PRXY:



 

Output from NLD-AMF-NW-PRXY:



 

Output from SGP-SGP-NW-PRXY (even when run locally as an administrator):



 

Output from CHN-SHG-NW-PRXY (even when run locally as an administrator):



 

 

I then proceeded to copy the README.txt file from the main server to the same location in all four of the proxy servers:

 

Output from USA-RNC-NW-PRXY after copying to README.txt file to the server:



 

Output from NLD-AMF-NW-PRXY after copying to README.txt file to the server:

Output from CHN-SHG-NW-PRXY after copying to README.txt file to the server (even when run locally as an administrator):



 

 

I started the proxy sensitive data scans again and they are all working on the first try:

If it is truly missing on any of the host we can pull it from NEA server path and place it where it is needed on the proxy host.

Let's then run the jobs again to see if there same file is noted in the error.

Stephen,

Per our call today we looked that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) 11.6.0.79

It was found that the Log Maintenance that is used to clean up the Proxy FSAA logs was also removing the Log Maintenance README.txt file from the Proxy host.

To correct this, we removed the '.txt' from the Save Last Analysis the noted txt files are not longer getting added to the 1-LogCleanup table so the 2-DeleteFiles should no longer reference for the

foreach ($i in $input) {
  Remove-Item -path $i.PathAndName
}

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

If it is truly missing on any of the host we can pull it from NEA server path and place it where it is needed on the proxy host.

Stephen,

Per our call today we looked that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) 11.6.0.79

It was found that the Log Maintenance that is used to clean up the Proxy FSAA logs was also removing the Log Maintenance README.txt file from the Proxy host. 

To correct this, we removed the '.txt' from the Save Last Analysis the noted txt files are not longer getting added to the 1-LogCleanup table so the 2-DeleteFiles should no longer reference for the 

foreach ($i in $input) {
   Remove-Item -path $i.PathAndName
} 

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Output from NLD-AMF-NW-PRXY:



 

Output from SGP-SGP-NW-PRXY (even when run locally as an administrator):



 

Output from CHN-SHG-NW-PRXY (even when run locally as an administrator):



 

 

I then proceeded to copy the README.txt file from the main server to the same location in all four of the proxy servers:

If it is truly missing on any of the host we can pull it from NEA server path and place it where it is needed on the proxy host.

Let's then run the jobs again to see if there same file is noted in the error.

Stephen,

Per our call today we looked that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) 11.6.0.79

It was found that the Log Maintenance that is used to clean up the Proxy FSAA logs was also removing the Log Maintenance README.txt file from the Proxy host.

To correct this, we removed the '.txt' from the Save Last Analysis the noted txt files are not longer getting added to the 1-LogCleanup table so the 2-DeleteFiles should no longer reference for the

foreach ($i in $input) {
  Remove-Item -path $i.PathAndName
}

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Stephen,

Best if pasted into the edit window in an ADMIN PowerShell ISE session. Then Copy the text from the output window.

Clear-Host
$Servers = ""CHN-SHG-NW-PRXY"",""NLD-AMF-NW-PRXY"",""USA-RNC-NW-PRXY"",""SGP-SGP-NW-PRXY""

Foreach ($Server in $Servers){

$README_paths = gci ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA*README.txt"" -Recurse

                }
}


If it is truly missing on any of the host we can pull it from NEA server path and place it where it is needed on the proxy host.
%sainstalldir%FSAASensitiveDatajdk-17.0.7+7-jreconfsecuritypolicy

Let's then run the jobs again to see if there same file is noted in the error.

Again, thank You for your time.
