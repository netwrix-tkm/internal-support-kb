FSAA Scan Errors

After upgrading to 11.5 we are seeing a ton of these errors

<a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA</a>.FSAAException: Session 1261 went away at <a

Cause

Discovered that some of the FSAA proxies were running an older version.

Discovered too many simultaneous connections to proxy hosts.

These two variables were discovered as the root causes of this issue.

Resolution

Performed an upgrade to all FSAA proxy hosts to the latest 11.5 proxy. 

Performed a test FSAA system scan of only one of the affected hosts and was successful in scanning that host. 

Suggested tweaking the performance settings for the FSAA system scan job by lowering the thread count if this error resurfaces.","Guidance","Scottie Taylor","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Proxy","11.5","","12.1","Closed - Resolved","Bank of America Corporation","Gregory Meyer","2024-08-14T18:55:03.000Z","2024-08-26T20:27:13.000Z"
