Describe specifically what the customer is trying to accomplish.

The customer's end goal is to have a successful DLP scan by resolving special characters within a file path. The DLP scan recognizes the contents of the file path but throws a ? at the location of special characters associated with Hawaiian and Okina languages. 

Additionally, we have noticed that the scan also throws a ? as an additional character associated with a name. For example, instead of scanning the file as Miller, it will scan the file as M?iller. 

Desired Outcome:
How should the results appear or be presented to the user?

The results of the scan should resolve the special characters and present them as displayed on the file itself. 

What is the expected outcome?

Special characters resolved within the scan and a successful scan. 

Steps to Reproduce:
1.  Ran SEEK Scan job targeting the host displaying the special characters error.

Reliably Repro'd in Customer Envi
