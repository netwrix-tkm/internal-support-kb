Based on the Proxy logs Dev noted that we need to run the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm 

This will copy the new binaries to the Proxy from the 11.6.0.82 installation.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If the issue persist please re-run the Proxy script then uploaded the new zip file directly to the case as we did today.

[EXTERNAL SENDER] - Watch for Phishing Attack
Chris,

Based on the Proxy logs Dev noted that we need to run the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm

This will copy the new binaries to the Proxy from the 11.6.0.82 installation.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If the issue persist please re-run the Proxy script then uploaded the new zip file directly to the case as we did today.

As always, thank You for your time.

Hey Dusty,

Looks like the ones that were failing on the access violation error were successful, the whole package phantom schedule is still executing.  But so far it is looking like we will complete.

Chris,

Based on the Proxy logs Dev noted that we need to run the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm

This will copy the new binaries to the Proxy from the 11.6.0.82 installation.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If the issue persist please re-run the Proxy script then uploaded the new zip file directly to the case as we did today.

As always, thank You for your time.

Chris,

Based on the Proxy logs Dev noted that we need to run the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm

This will copy the new binaries to the Proxy from the 11.6.0.82 installation.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If the issue persist please re-run the Proxy script then uploaded the new zip file directly to the case as we did today.

As always, thank You for your time.

[EXTERNAL SENDER] - Watch for Phishing Attack
Chris,

Based on the Proxy logs Dev noted that we need to run the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm

This will copy the new binaries to the Proxy from the 11.6.0.82 installation.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If the issue persist please re-run the Proxy script then uploaded the new zip file directly to the case as we did today.

As always, thank You for your time.

Chris,

Based on the Proxy logs Dev noted that we need to run the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm

This will copy the new binaries to the Proxy from the 11.6.0.82 installation.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If the issue persist please re-run the Proxy script then uploaded the new zip file directly to the case as we did today.

As always, thank You for your time.

TO:
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA)    11.6.0.82
NEA Access Information Center       11.6.0.21

Chris,

Based on the Proxy logs Dev noted that we need to run the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm 

This will copy the new binaries to the Proxy from the 11.6.0.82 installation.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If the issue persist please re-run the Proxy script then uploaded the new zip file directly to the case as we did today.

As always, thank You for your time.

Hey Dusty,

I was working on the agent updates today, and got to a couple 2012R2 machines, I think I recall you saying that 2012r2 was rolled off with one of the versions of the agent software.  I pushed the upgrade to the two servers at the top of the list below (I had the OS version column too small and didn't see they were 12R2).  It appears to have succeeded, any thoughts on how to validate this is polling correctly on those two agents?  Additionally, if you can tell me the last version that is officially supporting 12R2 for the remaining machines I have to upgrade that would be great.  Screenshot below:

Chris,

Based on the Proxy logs Dev noted that we need to run the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm

This will copy the new binaries to the Proxy from the 11.6.0.82 installation.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If the issue persist please re-run the Proxy script then uploaded the new zip file directly to the case as we did today.

As always, thank You for your time.

Hey Dusty,

 

I was working on the agent updates today, and got to a couple 2012R2 machines, I think I recall you saying that 2012r2 was rolled off with one of the versions of the agent software.  I pushed the upgrade to the two servers at the top of the list below (I had the OS version column too small and didnât see they were 12R2).  It appears to have succeeded, any thoughts on how to validate this is polling correctly on those two agents?  Additionally, if you can tell me the last version that is officially supporting 12R2 for the remaining machines I have to upgrade that would be great.  Screenshot below:

Hey Dusty,

 

Looks like the ones that were failing on the access violation error were successful, the whole package phantom schedule is still executing.  But so far it is looking like we will complete.

Chris,

Based on the Proxy logs Dev noted that we need to run the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm 

This will copy the new binaries to the Proxy from the 11.6.0.82 installation.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If the issue persist please re-run the Proxy script then uploaded the new zip file directly to the case as we did today.

As always, thank You for your time.

NEA Access Information Center       11.6.0.21

Hey Dusty,

I was working on the agent updates today, and got to a couple 2012R2 machines, I think I recall you saying that 2012r2 was rolled off with one of the versions of the agent software.  I pushed the upgrade to the two servers at the top of the list below (I had the OS version column too small and didn't see they were 12R2).  It appears to have succeeded, any thoughts on how to validate this is polling correctly on those two agents?  Additionally, if you can tell me the last version that is officially supporting 12R2 for the remaining machines I have to upgrade that would be great.  Screenshot below:

[EXTERNAL SENDER] - Watch for Phishing Attack
Chris,

Based on the Proxy logs Dev noted that we need to run the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm

This will copy the new binaries to the Proxy from the 11.6.0.82 installation.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If the issue persist please re-run the Proxy script then uploaded the new zip file directly to the case as we did today.

As always, thank You for your time.

Hey Dusty,

 

I was working on the agent updates today, and got to a couple 2012R2 machines, I think I recall you saying that 2012r2 was rolled off with one of the versions of the agent software.  I pushed the upgrade to the two servers at the top of the list below (I had the OS version column too small and didnât see they were 12R2).  It appears to have succeeded, any thoughts on how to validate this is polling correctly on those two agents?  Additionally, if you can tell me the last version that is officially supporting 12R2 for the remaining machines I have to upgrade that would be great.  Screenshot below:

[EXTERNAL SENDER] - Watch for Phishing Attack



Chris,

Based on the Proxy logs Dev noted that we need to run the FS_UpdateProxy Job.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > File System Proxy as a Service Overview > Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm 

This will copy the new binaries to the Proxy from the 11.6.0.82 installation.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If the issue persist please re-run the Proxy script then uploaded the new zip file directly to the case as we did today.

As always, thank You for your time.
