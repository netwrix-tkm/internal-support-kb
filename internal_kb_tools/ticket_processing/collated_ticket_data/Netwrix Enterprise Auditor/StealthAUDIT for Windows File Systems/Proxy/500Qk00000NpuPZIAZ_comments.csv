@Michael Burrofato @Sanjay Meghani @WaitingOnEngineer Server Core is not fully supported, which is why the File Open dialog is failing to open when you're clicking the Browse button. A workaround for this is to supply a fully-qualified path to your stealthaudit.lic file on the msiexec command line:

msiexec /i auditor-enterprise-FileSystemProxy-12.0.0.1030.msi LICENSE_FILE=C:UsersusernameStealthAUDIT.LIC

The license file is the same as required for the console installation.
