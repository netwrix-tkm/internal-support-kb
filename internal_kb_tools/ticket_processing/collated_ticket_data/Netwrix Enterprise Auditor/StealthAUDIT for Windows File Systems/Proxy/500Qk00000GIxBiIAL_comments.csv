"00aQk000009c957IAA","500Qk00000GIxBiIAL","Problem Statement/Business Impact:
Some SDD jobs complete with a warning that the SEEK Bulk imported is needed.

When looking at the related jobs Bulk imported it notes that it completed Successfully 

Scanned Host
----
ARGO
CYCLOPS
DRF-ERNIE2
DRF-RINGO2
DRFSIRYN
ELEKTRA
INFORMATICS
KARMA

Noticed that the Proxies FSAA Host path is missing the SDD logs for this host.

Out of the Servers listed on the following have SDD logs.
DRF-RINGO2
ARGO

Desired Outcome:
For the SDD job to scan data via the proxy as other host using the same proxy are able to.

Then Import to SQL as normal

Steps to Reproduce:
Unable to replicated in my lab.

Reliably Repro'd in Customer Envi

Troubleshooting completed/Notes: 
Ran the Repair and Rest on the scanned host in question.

Tried a local scan to update the %sainstalldir%fsaahost files still the same result.

Ensure relevant logs are uploaded to SPO:
Application Logs
Job Logs
FSAA Proxy/Applet Logs

@Salesforce 
For host DRF-ERNIE2 the SDD job logs indicate that a scan was run where the warning mentioned was thrown, then bulk import was run successfully import ~10 million match hits, and then the scan was never run again. So, I would suggest running the scan again since the data is now successfully imported.

For host DRF-RINGO2 there was not a lot of information to get from the logs because they are not debug level, so it is not clear the SDD bulk import completed successfully. I would suggest running bulk import with debug logging enabled and if that is successful try scanning again, otherwise please provide the debug level logs.

For hosts DRFSIRYN, WILCOX, and PALIMOMI I do not see the warning mentioned in the latest SDD scan log provided.

It does not look like there are logs for all the hosts mentioned in the description, but this is my analysis of the logs provided.
