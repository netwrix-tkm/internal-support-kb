Hi Mike,

I’ll be away at a conference over the next few days. I know it’s a push, but do you have a few minutes to look at this today? Even if you could help with one system, I can then work on the rest on my own.

Best,
Nic

Just checking in if you have paused or rolled back?

Development hasn't weighed in yet. I am working on that.

I am handling the escalation and it's definitely a weird one. Haven't replicated in our labs either unfortunately, but still hoping for some development assistance.

Hi Mike,

 

I’ll be away at a conference over the next few days. I know it’s a push, but do you have a few minutes to look at this today? Even if you could help with one system, I can then work on the rest on my own.

 

Best,

Nic

If I reinstalled the FSAA 11.6 proxy, can that work with the 12.0 core application? If so, I can do that as a workaround and make this less critical.

Hi Nicholas, sorry for the delay. I was at a conference for the second half of last week, so my e-mails were delayed. For the time being, I've delayed collection of logs from my NetApp devices instead of rolling back. I'm hoping for a way to get the FSAA agents installed rather than moving back to 11.6, since I am actively bringing in logs from Windows File Servers (via my main Auditor server) and would hate to lose those.

This is a pretty handy tool that you can snag and Run to attempt to fully remove either the 11.6 or 12.0 proxy, not sure which will show up on the list.

Then you could attempt a reinstall of 12.0.

If you'd like a meeting to go over or run through this let me know and I'll shoot out an invite.

Hi Nicholas,

I appreciate the suggestion, but these proxy systems don’t have internet access.

Does the dev team have a command line argument for specifying the location of the license file? I think all I need is that command line argument since it isn’t in the Netwrix documentation, and the installer won’t let me click ‘browse’.

I can both install and uninstall 11.6 without issue onto these proxy systems, and I can install other programs, so I don’t believe the installer services nor OS is otherwise having trouble.

Hi Nicholas,

 

I appreciate the suggestion, but these proxy systems don’t have internet access. 

 

Does the dev team have a command line argument for specifying the location of the license file? I think all I need is that command line argument since it isn’t in the Netwrix documentation, and the installer won’t let me click ‘browse’. 

 

I can both install and uninstall 11.6 without issue onto these proxy systems, and I can install other programs, so I don’t believe the installer services nor OS is otherwise having trouble.  

 

Best,

 

Nic Smits

Not a problem at all.

Main reason I was reaching out was because I was wondering if you had tried any uninstall type tool to remove whatever is causing problems with this proxy installer?

Fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed - Microsoft Support

This is a pretty handy tool that you can snag and Run to attempt to fully remove either the 11.6 or 12.0 proxy, not sure which will show up on the list.

Then you could attempt a reinstall of 12.0.

If you'd like a meeting to go over or run through this let me know and I'll shoot out an invite.

Thanks,

Hi Nicholas, sorry for the delay. I was at a conference for the second half of last week, so my e-mails were delayed. For the time being, I've delayed collection of logs from my NetApp devices instead of rolling back. I'm hoping for a way to get the FSAA agents installed rather than moving back to 11.6, since I am actively bringing in logs from Windows File Servers (via my main Auditor server) and would hate to lose those. Thanks -Nic

Development confirmed it is due to server core here is the command for you from them.

msiexec /i auditor-enterprise-FileSystemProxy-12.0.0.1030.msi LICENSE_FILE=C:UsersusernameStealthAUDIT.LIC

The license file is the same as required for the console installation.

Let me know if/when that works. Sorry for the delay.

Fantastic,

I will get this to development and we will hopefully have a quick turn around now that we go what they want.

Your thoroughness is very appreciated.

Hi Nicholas,

 

No problem.

 

I uninstalled FSAA v11.6 from AC-PRD-ENTPROX2, then rebooted. I then launched the installer, changed the install path (as shown in screenshot 1), attempted to install without selecting a license (per screenshot 2), which errored, and then attempted to click browse which caused the installer to fail (per screenshot 3).

 

I’ve attached the log, as well as notepad exports of my systeminfo (showing patch levels, system reboot time, etc.) and my running tasklist. 

 

Please note that this server (AC-PRD-ENTPROX2) doesn’t have any FSAA Agent installed right now but does have the Activity Monitor agent still installed onto it.

 

Best,

 

Nic Smits

Hey Nicholas,

Development wants you to make sure post uninstall 11.6 proxy. Make sure no processes are still hanging around or services running. Just to be save maybe reboot the proxy.

Then attempt to use this command line to install.

msiexec /i ""auditor-enterprise-FileSystemProxy-12.0.0.1030.msi"" /L*VX ""C:tempfsproxyinstall.log""
 

If it errors again, most likely will, can you provide that log and they will dig into the bug.

Thanks,

Alright, 

I thought for some reason neither would install or reinstall. So yeah I have requested a command line to account for the license. I'll update as soon as I hear back from them.
