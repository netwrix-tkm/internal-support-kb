I'm looking for some assistance if possable.

I've been asked to use Enterprise Auditor and our purchased action model in over to copy/move files in our environment however i'm struggling building out the job to do this. I've tried following to documentation but cant get my head around the prerequisites needed. Would someone be available to run me through the process of creating this type of job.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-19T08:01:05.000Z"
