@Salesforce 

My leading theory is that the applet service is running in an unexpected location. There is a part of the action module on the first page of the wizard where you can select ""Remove the applet service from a host"". This will uninstall the applet service and it should be reinstalled in the correct location upon the next run of any action.

 

If you want to find and show where the applet is installed, you should check the ""Path to executable"" property of the action module service in the Services panel. Or search all drives for StealthAUDITRPCFSAM.exe

 

Once I receive logs I'll look to see if there's more leads in there, this is what I think is likely after viewing the video and the code.

After checking the logs, it appears everything is in order with the versions and where it's trying to deploy to, but it doesn't update the service executable path when it already exists. My best guess is still that the service is pointing to an executable path in some old install directory, maybe on another drive.

I'd prefer checking the executable path in the service properties page to confirm or rule this possibility out. And if it's not in the right location, uninstall the service and re-run the action","0050g000006QqyEAAS","2024-07-31T19:45:10.000Z","2024-07-31T19:45:10.000Z","false","false"

@Salesforce 

Ah yes, the install directory of ""D:STEALTHbitsStealthAUDIT"" is different than the currently configured install dir of ""D:STEALTHbits"". The applet files are being sent to """"D:STEALTHbits"""" the correct directory"," but the service still references """"D:STEALTHbitsStealthAUDIT"""". Uninstalling the service either through the NEA UI or through the services panel should resolve the issue."
