"500Qk00000GluC2IAJ","00423240","Support Ticket","Possibilities to check Azure Cloud Netapp job scan in SA","What are all the possibilities to configure Job scan for Azure Cloud shares Netapp in stealth audit.","","","","1. ""AnyData for Azure Files"" addon you found is only for the Sensitive Data. Currently, NEA does not support Azure Files, but it is roadmapped and in progress. We don't have an exact ETA for this feature, I asked the product team about that. ""Netwrix Auditor Add-On for Activity"" is related to Netwrix Auditor only and it doesn't work with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (formerly StealthAUDIT).
2. FSAA/FSAC scan of Azure Netapp Files is roadmapped in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.
3. Currently, NAM can gather the activity from Azure CVO, but as the FSAC doesn't support it the activity data can not be imported into NEA at this moment.","Unsupported data source","Aleksandr Timofeev","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Data Collection","11.5","","8.0","Closed - Resolved","Kyndryl","Fenilkumar S","2024-10-08T09:35:42.000Z","2024-10-16T08:50:52.000Z"
