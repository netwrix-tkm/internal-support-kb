"500Qk00000KsoQxIAJ","00432976","Support Ticket","Continuation: File Types report Pie Chart works but no detailed data is available","File Types report job timeout was increased. 
As a result, the File Types job is completing successfully. However, there is still no detailed data available in the report. 

Report has a Filter configuration: 
File Size Less or Equal to 100.  

However, when we try removing this filter from the report, then Fyle Types report job starts failing with:
 ""A severe error occurred on the current command. The results, if any, should be discarded. Operation canceled by user. The statement has been terminated.""","Have ""FS_FileTypes"" report job configured. 
Have a default filter configured for the Details Grid: [Size rank] is less than or equal to 100 
Remove this filter
Run ""FS_FileTypes"" report job 
Job fails with:
""A severe error occurred on the current command. The results, if any, should be discarded. Operation canceled by user. The statement has been terminated.""

The resulted report has correct Pie Chart, but the bottom grid is empty.","This ticket is a continuation of this one:
00423239 - File Types report chart works but no detailed data is available

After increasing FS_FileTypes job timeout the job now completes successfully. 
However, the Filter on the ""File Types"" is still in place and there are no details visible bellow the Pie Chart. 

According to information provided by Fenilkumar, when we try to remove the filter from ""File Type"" report and run the FS_FileTypes job again, this error appears:
""A severe error occurred on the current command. The results, if any, should be discarded. Operation canceled by user. The statement has been terminated.""
And the FS_FileTypes job fails to complete. 

Currently the FS_FileTypes job is running, and the ""File Types"" report is configured to have a filter.","Support is waiting for customer to reply after ""FS_FileType"" job completes. 
After that support will schedule another meeting with customer to test if the ""FS_FileType"" job fails when the Filter is removed from ""File Types"" report.","The ""FS_FileTypes"" Job was failing due to time out error. 
After increasing the timeout for the ""FS_FileTypes"" Report Job to 7 days the job started running as expected. 

Timeout was increased using the FS_FileTypes  job properties using these steps:
Right - Click the FS_FileTypes job > select ""Properties"" > in the ""General"" tab will be a ""Timeout"" parameter. 

The FS_FileTypes job eventually completed successfully and both Pie Chart and the Details table below were populated with corresponding information successfully.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Artem Naskal","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Data Collection","11.5","11.5.0.182","15.9","Closed - Resolved","Kyndryl","Fenilkumar S","2025-01-21T13:52:59.000Z","2025-02-06T11:31:14.000Z"
