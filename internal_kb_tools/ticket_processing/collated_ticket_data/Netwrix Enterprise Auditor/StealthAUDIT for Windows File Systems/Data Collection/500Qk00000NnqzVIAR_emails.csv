Thanks Mike. I attached the OUTPUT.zip file in the ticket.  And yes, I am referring to the job listed in this online document.

0-Create Schema Job<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/FileSystem/Collection/0-Create_Schema.htm>

It appears that the last two jobs are new.

17. Create Azure Tables – Just creating tables doesn’t take too long.
18. Data Migration – This is the script that is taking forever. It was around 83 hours before I stopped it. I can’t run any scan as I got the message I must run the Create Schema job first. My issue is, will this take 4 days? 8 days? 2 weeks? Nobody seems to know. I have it running again and is currently at 15 hours.

I looked through the SQL script to see if I can find what it’s doing to try and get an idea of how long it will take with the amount of data we have. Not sure what data it’s migrating. I was hoping to see if may we got rid of some logs or maybe the database has a bunch of data that can be cleaned up.

A) Today on the call, for NAA 12, Step 18.Data Migration had been running for another 41 hours after it ran for 81+ hours the first time that you ran it and then killed it.

B) We consulted with our Product Management and Dev teams and they gave us a workaround to remove the constraints from 2 tables based upon the what we were seeing in SSMS > Activity Monitor > Active Expensive Queries. 

They had us turn off the FK constraint on 2 tables:
""SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails""
""SA_FSAA_ResourceMap""

and then Step ""18.Data Migration"" completed very quickly.

C) Next we re-applied the 2 constraints:
1) It might be a better option to turn off the FK constraint check on the ""SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails"" table during the migration:

ALTER TABLE ResourcesScanTypeDetails NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

2) then afterwards:

ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

3) ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

4) ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL
D) And now you are running one of your scans which we anticipate will take about one (1+) day(s) to complete.

Thank you,
Mike Candon

Hello Steven,

I wanted to follow up after our recent online meeting to see how things are going. I haven’t heard from you since our last discussion and wanted to check if you were able to make progress on the items we talked about or if you still need assistance.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further support—I’m here to help!

Looking forward to your response.

Ticket Number: 00441249
Ticket Subject: Create Schema - Data Migration
Ticket Details: I installed Netwrix Access Analyzer 12.0. When I tried to scan, it gave me the message that I had to run the Create Schema job. I ran it, and after running for about 83 hours, I stopped in case something was happening. It is running the task 18. Data Migration SQL Script 1 of 3. I noticed this is a new task compared to previous times of running this job. Is it normal for this migration to take this long? Is there a way to get an idea of how long the migration will take?

Thank you!

Hi Mike. Not sure if this is tied to anything, but all of my permission scan jobs have the error message:

[cid:image001.png@01DBAD2C.297D5ED0]

This is happening on all of our scan jobs. They worked just fine on Friday, so not sure what happened. I have some other team members to check on our side to see if anything with the network changed.  I wouldn’t think that the Create Schema would have done this since I’ve had some successful scans since then. If you can, let me know if I need to open a new ticket for the timeout issue.

Hello Steven,

I wanted to follow up after our recent online meeting to see how things are going. I haven’t heard from you since our last discussion and wanted to check if you were able to make progress on the items we talked about or if you still need assistance.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further support—I’m here to help!

Looking forward to your response.

Ticket Number: 00441249
Ticket Subject: Create Schema - Data Migration
Ticket Details: I installed Netwrix Access Analyzer 12.0. When I tried to scan, it gave me the message that I had to run the Create Schema job. I ran it, and after running for about 83 hours, I stopped in case something was happening. It is running the task 18. Data Migration SQL Script 1 of 3. I noticed this is a new task compared to previous times of running this job. Is it normal for this migration to take this long? Is there a way to get an idea of how long the migration will take?

Thank you!

I have opened the new case for you = 00442026 - NAA 12 - permission scan job are erroring with ""The operation has timed out.""
I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved.
The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!
+++++
A) Today on the call, for NAA 12, Step 18.Data Migration had been running for another 41 hours after it ran for 81+ hours the first time that you ran it and then killed it.

B) We consulted with our Product Management and Dev teams and they gave us a workaround to remove the constraints from 2 tables based upon the what we were seeing in SSMS > Activity Monitor > Active Expensive Queries.

They had us turn off the FK constraint on 2 tables:
""SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails""
""SA_FSAA_ResourceMap""

and then Step ""18.Data Migration"" completed very quickly.

C) Next we re-applied the 2 constraints:
1) It might be a better option to turn off the FK constraint check on the ""SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails"" table during the migration:

ALTER TABLE ResourcesScanTypeDetails NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

2) then afterwards:

ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

3) ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

4) ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

D) And now you are running one of your scans which we anticipate will take about one (1+) day(s) to complete.
+++++

Thank you,

Hi Mike. Not sure if this is tied to anything, but all of my permission scan jobs have the error message:

 



 

This is happening on all of our scan jobs. They worked just fine on Friday, so not sure what happened. I have some other team members to check on our side to see if anything with the network changed.  I wouldn’t think that the Create Schema would have done this since I’ve had some successful scans since then. If you can, let me know if I need to open a new ticket for the timeout issue.

Hi Steven,

I can keep the case in an automated monitoring mode where it will send out an email every 2 (business?) days or so.

You can provide an update on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week or the next time that the automated email goes out to you.

Thank you,

Hi Mike. I was gonna send a status update later today.  All of our SDD scans completed successfully yesterday.  So far, all of our permission scans are running smoothly today.
