Hello Giri,

I’m reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven’t heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00440079
Ticket Subject: ProServ - FSAA/FS_SEEK .net error crash
Ticket Details: We have had this happen many times since day 1 of project, but didn't notice until we dove deep into data collected. Our FSAA and FS_SEEK collection jobs crash ungracefully, leave behind the running.lck file, and cause a .net crash on our NEA server. I am not able to recreate this in my lab as this seems to be in client environment only. Client does have Crowdstrike but has check multiple times and does not find any blocks happening. I have uploaded logs, and screen shots of .net error.

We did try to upgrade to latest NEA and SDD but .net error persisted.

FSAA/FS_SEEK collections would be able to finish with out causing .net error to happen.


I am not able to recreate this in my lab, as this does seem to be in client environment only. I did try a windows collection in my lab but did not experience this.

Thank you!

Nicholas Zimmer
