When I tried to scan, it gave me the message that I had to run the Create Schema job. I ran it, and after running for about 83 hours, I stopped in case something was happening. It is running the task 18. Data Migration SQL Script 1 of 3. I noticed this is a new task compared to previous times of running this job. Is it normal for this migration to take this long? Is there a way to get an idea of how long the migration will take?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-07T23:42:43.000Z"

B) We consulted with our Product Management and Dev teams and they gave us a workaround to remove the constraints from 2 tables based upon the what we were seeing in SSMS > Activity Monitor > Active Expensive Queries. 

They had us turn off the FK constraint on 2 tables:
""SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails""
""SA_FSAA_ResourceMap""

and then Step ""18.Data Migration"" completed very quickly.

C) Next we re-applied the 2 constraints:
1) It might be a better option to turn off the FK constraint check on the ""SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails"" table during the migration:

ALTER TABLE ResourcesScanTypeDetails NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

2) then afterwards:

ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

3) ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

4) ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap WITH CHECK CHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

D) And now you are running one of your scans which we anticipate will take about one (1+) day(s) to complete.","","","","005Qk00000276ifIAA","2025-04-11T20:57:14.000Z"
