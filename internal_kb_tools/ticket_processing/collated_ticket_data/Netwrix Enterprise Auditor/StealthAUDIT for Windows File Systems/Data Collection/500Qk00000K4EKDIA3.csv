Hello Support Team,

After upgrading customer to latest versions as of 12/20/2024, FSAA is now not completing, and the rest of the jobs do not even start past bulk import. We upgraded to resolve issue described in case 00422386, seems to be still related however now affecting FSAA. The logs do not appear to show anything much. Task scheduler says exit code 0 returned after bulk import attempts. FSAA system scan time is 0 seconds (typically see this if the job is terminated unexpectedly).

I'm not really sure where to start with this one, it's super strange and hard to follow since we have a proxy involved, lots of servers, and some of those servers have millions+ files.

Server,Software,Version
ConsoleServer,Netwrix Enterprise Auditor V11.6,11.6.0.125
ConsoleServer,Netwrix Access Information Center,11.6.0.25
ConsoleServer,Netwrix Activity Monitor Agent 64-bit,7.1.234
ConsoleServer,Netwrix Activity Monitor,7.1.234
ConsoleServer,Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On V11.6,11.6.0.14
ProxyServer,Netwrix Enterprise Auditor File System Scanning Proxy,11.6.0.36
ProxyServer,Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On V11.6,11.6.0.14

Please let me know best next steps.

Thank you,
Justin.","","Successful FileSystem collection run with FSAA/FSAC/SEEK enabled after making the following changes:
1. Add FSAAScanHost.exe to AV exclusions
2. Limit FSAA to only scan two hosts at a time
3. HSP1M1 file server, add scoping to skip a few paths since those files rapidly change on a daily basis

Job kicked off during the meeting 
Looks to have gotten stuck at transferring the compressed DBs back to NEA server, got to 2.86GB (of the 10.03 GB FS archive) and that was last log entry. ( Job Aborted)

Awaiting details of any issues from a Networking or Hypervisor perspective. ""may have had resource contention""

Last update from the case contact
limited HSP1M1 to level 1, ran successfully bulk as well
HSP1M1 set to unlimited levels, ran successfully bulk as well
Ran original host list (31 servers) and job failed like it has been previously
Limited job to run against 3 hosts at a time versus 5 hosts, scan is still running at unlimited and all 31 servers","Last Customer Follow-Up: 2/18

The FSAA Scan was set to a temporary depth of 1 and the scheduled task was kicked off.

The problem host (HS1MP1) was still ""verifying database"" at the end of the call (almost an hour after starting based on the log).
We will need to set the Depth back to full by unchecking the box “Limit sub-folder scan depth to:”
