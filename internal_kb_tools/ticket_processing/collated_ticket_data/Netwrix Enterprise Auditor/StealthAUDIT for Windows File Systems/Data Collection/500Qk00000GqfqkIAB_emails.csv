Hello Phil,

I wanted to follow up after our recent online meeting to see how things are going. I haven’t heard from you since our last discussion and wanted to check if you were able to make progress on the items we talked about or if you still need assistance.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further support—I’m here to help!

Looking forward to your response.
