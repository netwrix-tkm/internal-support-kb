Mike my apologies, I see my email reply attached to this ticket.  I used to see the actual ticket number in the subject line of emails. 

Anyway, I just learned as I looked into this more the ""Direct_Permission"" result of the job is over 1 million+ rows and apparently, I just needed to be patient.   It finally completed without crashing the console app.

So, I was looking for two specific AD groups to see where they might have been applied, but my filtering on the 'Trustee column' didn't return any results. I assume these groups are NOT applied anywhere.

Question - Do you have any documentation about what the 'FSAA_GROUP_Direct_permissions' (under Direct Permissions job) collects?  This article does not reference it.

Has the job completed so that now you can sort on the Trustee column?

Are you still running SA v11.5?

I cannot find the ""'FSAA_GROUP_Direct_permissions"" job in NEA v11.6.
Do you know if this is a customization built by professional services?

I have found a few views in the database but I am not sure if they have the information that you need.

Do you want me to send you a meeting invite right now?

No, I think I have what I need from the ‘Direct_Permissions_view’, it just took a long time because of the amount of data collected.   I open the ticket because the Console kept locking up, but in fact it was still working in the background.

I will close this ticket.

Hi Bradley,

Has the job completed so that now you can sort on the Trustee column?

Are you still running SA v11.5?

I cannot find the ""'FSAA_GROUP_Direct_permissions"" job in NEA v11.6.
Do you know if this is a customization built by professional services?

I have found a few views in the database but I am not sure if they have the information that you need.

Do you want me to send you a meeting invite right now?

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer
