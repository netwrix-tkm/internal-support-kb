Not at this time, though after 11/22 meeting, when we will hopefully have resolved all connections/jobs for Entra, Exchange online, Sharepoint online, I'd like to revist/ensure those jobs are running smoothly on a schedule.


Additionally, the ultimate goal of all these updates is to have the Distribution report (in the sandbox) running / pulling data from Exchange online, to accurately reflect all Distribution traffic.

Thank You for the update.

That Distribution report should be corrected with the data collection update being worked in Ticket Number 00425035
 
I will close out this 1-FSAC System Scan ticket for us.

We have 30days to reopen once the closure email is received.

Not at this time, though after 11/22 meeting, when we will hopefully have resolved all connections/jobs for Entra, Exchange online, Sharepoint online, I'd like to revist/ensure those jobs are running smoothly on a schedule.

 

 

Additionally, the ultimate goal of all these updates is to have the Distribution report (in the sandbox) running / pulling data from Exchange online, to accurately reflect all Distribution traffic.

I was able to get job to run.

 

Adjusted INBOUND rule for Stealth Audit Applet that allows TCP 8766 - added 8767 for both WYDOC3 and WYDOC4.

There was a firewall rule turned off on WYDOC4 for Inbound traffic - this was already enabled on wydoc3.

Rule = ""Netwrix Activity Monitor SBFileMonAgentSvc Allow TCP SBFileMonAgentSvc""

---This was turned on.  Since WYDOC3 and WYDOC4 are a failover cluster, this may be why it erred for all three (wydoc3, wydoc4, documentsdtc).

 

I ran the FSAC job again- same failed results.

 

I'll reach out to security manager for these ports to be opened between our 10.30.x.x subnet and our Performive private cloud network on 10.100.x.x
