Hi Jimmy,

I was asking for the job so I can identify what was difference between a working job (My lab) and the job that was throwing error.

Please run the maintenance repair tool on the FSAC bulk import and let me know if you're still experiencing the same issue. Please ensure that no file system jobs run while the repair is in progress. Repairs sometimes require 2 or 3 runs to catch all the necessary issues.

FSAA: Query Selection

If you select FSAC bulk import job > select queries > query properties > click configure > click maintenance button > select repair > select ok > and run. 








Have a great day!

Hi Jimmy,

I was asking for the job so I can identify what was difference between a working job (My lab) and the job that was throwing error.

Please run the maintenance repair tool on the FSAC bulk import and let me know if you're still experiencing the same issue. Please ensure that no file system jobs run while the repair is in progress. Repairs sometimes require 2 or 3 runs to catch all the necessary issues.

FSAA: Query Selection

If you select FSAC bulk import job > select queries > query properties > click configure > click maintenance button > select repair > select ok > and run. 








Have a great day!

I hope you are doing well.

The DataAnalysisTasks.xml you have uploaded seems to be invalid. Is that from the Create Schema job that was producing this error?
If not, can you please upload the correct xml file.

Due to the high volume of P1s, the investigation into this issue has been delayed. Currently, I don't have any updates.

Hi Jimmy,

I was asking for the job so I can identify what was difference between a working job (My lab) and the job that was throwing error.

Please run the maintenance repair tool on the FSAC bulk import and let me know if you're still experiencing the same issue. Please ensure that no file system jobs run while the repair is in progress. Repairs sometimes require 2 or 3 runs to catch all the necessary issues.

FSAA: Query Selection

If you select FSAC bulk import job > select queries > query properties > click configure > click maintenance button > select repair > select ok > and run. 








Have a great day!

Hi Jimmy,

I was asking for the job so I can identify what was difference between a working job (My lab) and the job that was throwing error.

Please run the maintenance repair tool on the FSAC bulk import and let me know if you're still experiencing the same issue. Please ensure that no file system jobs run while the repair is in progress. Repairs sometimes require 2 or 3 runs to catch all the necessary issues.

FSAA: <https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/QuerySelection.htm>  Query Selection

If you select FSAC bulk import job > select queries > query properties > click configure > click maintenance button > select repair > select ok > and run. 








Have a great day!

You also can get this job in you lab.

Hi Jimmy,

I was asking for the job so I can identify what was difference between a working job (My lab) and the job that was throwing error.

Please run the maintenance repair tool on the FSAC bulk import and let me know if you're still experiencing the same issue. Please ensure that no file system jobs run while the repair is in progress. Repairs sometimes require 2 or 3 runs to catch all the necessary issues.

FSAA: Query Selection

If you select FSAC bulk import job > select queries > query properties > click configure > click maintenance button > select repair > select ok > and run. 








Have a great day!
