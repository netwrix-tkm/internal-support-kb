FileSystem Activity (FSAC) data within the Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) is not being updated.

Cause:
The Network share path for the NAM archives was receiving an access denied error ConfigurationAgent.Grpc.Host.errors, tsv
However the logs were also not located in the C:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAC<host-name>_log_.tsv

Resolution:
We corrected the Service account details within NAM as well as granted the needed access to the Share and NTFs path on the NAM/NEA host.
Disabled the Proxy option for this jobs as the archived evens will be pushed to the NEA host.

Symptom:
FileSystem FSAA System Scans noted that a bulk import was needed
Cause:
Unknown at this time
Resolution:
Qued the needed bulk import

Symptom:
Main FileSystem SEEK scan errored 
Cause:
The copied file name and resulting path was longer than Windows natively allows (254) at 259 characters. 
Resolution:
Within the Registry the following was enabled 
""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"" -Name ""LongPathsEnabled"" -Value 1 

The host PageFile was also limited to only the Largest Drive ( D:) to mitigate the OS mishandling the needed system controlled expansion that would result in failed scan.
***NOTE*** For these settings to fully take affect the NEA host will need to be Rebooted.","Awaiting the next scan to confirm settings changes","Symptom:
