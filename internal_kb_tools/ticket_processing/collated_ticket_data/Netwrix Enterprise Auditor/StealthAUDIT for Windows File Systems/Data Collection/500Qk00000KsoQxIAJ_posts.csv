As a result, the File Types job is completing successfully. However, there is still no detailed data available in the report. 

Report has a Filter configuration: 
File Size Less or Equal to 100.  

However, when we try removing this filter from the report, then Fyle Types report job starts failing with:
 ""A severe error occurred on the current command. The results, if any, should be discarded. Operation canceled by user. The statement has been terminated.""","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-01-21T13:53:00.000Z"

00423239 - File Types report chart works but no detailed data is available

After increasing FS_FileTypes job timeout the job now completes successfully. 
However, the Filter on the ""File Types"" is still in place and there are no details visible bellow the Pie Chart. 

According to information provided by Fenilkumar, when we try to remove the filter from ""File Type"" report and run the FS_FileTypes job again, this error appears:
""A severe error occurred on the current command. The results, if any, should be discarded. Operation canceled by user. The statement has been terminated.""
And the FS_FileTypes job fails to complete. 

Currently the FS_FileTypes job is running, and the ""File Types"" report is configured to have a filter.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-01-21T13:58:10.000Z"
