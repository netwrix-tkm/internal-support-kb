Hello Ilya


We are interested to see if Netwrix can help us with file access analysis for Projectwise like it does for a regular Windows file server.  This diagram shows the setup we are expecting to build â€“ itâ€™s a bit generic  but itâ€™s the file storages  part I think Netwrix would look at:

At this stage I was interested to know if Netwrix have any customers who might already be using the product in environments like this.
