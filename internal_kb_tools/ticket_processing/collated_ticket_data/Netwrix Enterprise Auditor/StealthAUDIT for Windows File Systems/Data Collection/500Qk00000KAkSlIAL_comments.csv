@Salesforce Dev was able to review and believes they found a bug during the create FSAC tables.sql script. So we have an investigation on the backlog to reproduce and look into fixing this at this time.

@Salesforce Hi Pasan, with the release wrapping up, Dev has already started taking on escalations, and so as we are switching priority over to addressing escalations. After a full sprint of escalation work, I'll be able to better estimate which sprint it will be pulled on. 
There are 19 other P2s, so we will try to bring this on as soon as possible.
