Scenarios for why we need to run ""Create Schema"" standalone.
+++++

1) Typically it's only necessary after an upgrade or if you drop all the file system data in order to create the file system schema.

2) There are changes that occur between versions as well where it has been required also.

3) It used to be only necessary when upgrading to a major release however we have had many cases where we've had to run it after a ""cumulative update"" installation because there were schema changes.  Cumulative Updates are the the update releases that come out roughly each week.","005Qk00000276ifIAA","2024-10-09T22:31:24.000Z","2024-10-09T22:31:24.000Z","false","false"
