"500Qk00000HTOMyIAP","00425083","Support Ticket","Error with 2-FSAC Bulk Import Step","I recently had some issues with the File System Scan job. I noticed that the drive on the server had limited space, so I expanded the drive.

When the File System Scan job runs the 1-FSAC System Scans has a warning that says ""Cannot scan, Activity Scan needs bulk import.""

When the 2-FSAC Bulk Import step runs in errors with the following message 

<a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA</a>.FSAAException: ID 32368372 mapping not found in ResourceMap

Please advise.

Thanks,
Frank","","Using ""Reset Hosts"" should not cause data loss nor data duplication.

It also will have no effect on the other (NetApp) hosts.

NEA - Potential reasons for why we need to reset the GUID in the first place:
+++++
1) Usually  interrupted scans due to reboot or a job crash. 
2) Sometimes multiple scans on the same host at the same time attempting to run.
3) If you are using proxies or targeting windows hosts sometimes network issues can cause partial copy's of the tier 2 storage so when you import the data, it isn't as it should be.
+++++


#####
Reset Hosts – Resets the Access GUID column value in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table for the Hosts selected. Allows data to be bulk imported when there is a GUID mismatch.
#####","From Frank Salah:
+++++
1) The Repair job ended up only taking an hour or so to complete and it looks like the import job ran successfully.

2) However, when I go to the Stealthbits web page > Access > Resource Audit web page I see that ""Activity Details"" from 10/24/2024 to 10/31/2024 seems to be blank. I am looking at a folder that I know has activity and I queried the database directly and see the activity in there.

3) I had some similar issue like this recently.

He will most likely have to run FSAC scan and import again.","Using ""Reset Hosts"" should not cause data loss nor data duplication.
