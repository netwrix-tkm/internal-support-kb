1) The data not displaying in AIC for some days last week may have been to a delay in data processing.
Everything in Stealthbits AIC (Netwrix AIC) looked good today.
You are not in the SteathAUDIT and AIC environments often (at this point in time).

2) In the new year (2025), you should submit separate tickets for the following upgrades:

a) Upgrade StealthAUDIT 11.5 to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6 - we should also perform a Netwrix AIC upgrade.
b) Upgrade StealthINTERCEPT (SI) 7.3.7 to Netwrix Threat Prevention (NTP) 7.3.9 or 7.4 and also upgrade NTM Reporting Module - additionally review your ST/NTP database maintenance job
c) Upgrade StealthDEFEND to the latest available version of Netwrix Threat Manager. 

As per our meeting today, I will close this case.

Hi Frank,

Now that the Repair ran successfully, you would need to run again in order:
 
1-FSAC System Scans
2-FSAC Bulk Import

Do you want me to send a meeting invite to you so that we can investigate this problem more closely in your environment?

Thank you,

It ended up only taking an hour or so to complete the repair and it looks like the import job ran successfully.

 

However, when I go to the Stealthbits web page > Access > Resource Audit web page I see that Activity Details from 10/24/2024 to 10/31/2024 seems to be blank. I am looking at a folder that I know has activity and I queried the database directly and see the activity in there.

 

I had some similar issue like this recently.

 


Thanks,

Frank

Hi Frank,

1) I see from your email that the Repair tool did complete so this is better news at this time.

2) How long is the Repair option taking to complete?
Is it a couple (2) of hours or 8-10+ hours?
If if is 8-10+ hours in the future can you try to run it overnight by setting a Scheduled job?

3) In your installation directory = %SAInstallDir%FSAA (there is a folder called FSAA)
or something similar to: 
E:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA (as an example)

In this FSAA directory where you run the ""Reset Hosts"" option it will generate a log called ""2024_09_09T10_11_47ResetHosts.log"" (as an example).
In this FSAA directory where you run the ""Repair"" (hosts) option it will generate a log called ""2024_10_30T11_11_49RepairTool.log"" (as an example).

I do not believe that we need them now but please keep them in mind for future reference.


Thank you,

It did finally complete.

 

I am running the import now. So far it seems to be working, but I am waiting for it to complete.

 

I will keep you posted.

Great thanks!

 

I did the reset, but the bulk import still seemed to fail with the same error.

 

I am doing the repair option, but it seems to just stop at 20%. I am not sure if it just takes a long time to run or if it is stuck.

Hi Frank,

Using ""Reset Hosts"" should not cause data loss nor data duplication.

It also will have no effect on the other (NetApp) hosts.

+++++
NEA - Potential reasons for why we need to reset the GUID in the first place:
+++++
1) Usually  interrupted scans due to reboot or a job crash. 
2) Sometimes multiple scans on the same host at the same time attempting to run.
3) If you are using proxies or targeting windows hosts sometimes network issues can cause partial copy's of the tier 2 storage so when you import the data, it isn't as it should be.
+++++

Also, is there a way to determine what would cause this issue that we need to reset the GUID in the first place?

Thanks for the explanation and thanks for providing the link.

 

Will this cause any data loss, or does it just cause possible data duplication?

 

Also, in my environment, we have our NetApp displaying like this in the database (see screenshot) to resolve an issue and maintain previous data. I want to make sure this will not impact this or cause any further issues with this. There should be existing tickets that explains why things were done this way.

Frank

Hi Frank,


	Reset Hosts – Resets the Access GUID column value in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table for the Hosts selected. Allows data to be bulk imported when there is a GUID mismatch.


So then when you run your next bulk import it will attempt to do a full import of data regardless of whether the data is there or not.

Please see the following documentation:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/QuerySelection.htm

Hi Mike,

 

Thanks for providing these steps. Before I take any action on this, could you explain exactly what “Reset Hosts” does?

Hi Frank,

Let me know if you would like to meet.
Here are the steps that should resolve your issue.
Please see the attached screenshot.

+++++
1) Open NEA

2) Navigate to: Jobs > FileSystem > ""0.Collection"" > ""1-FSAC System Scans"" > Configure > Queries

3) Click the ""Query Properties"" hyperlink and in the ""Query Properties"" mini-window, click the ""Configure"" button to open the ""File System Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard"".

4) Next in the ""File System Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard"" mini-window, click the ""Maintenance"" button.

5) Take the default option of ""Reset Hosts"" and click the ""Next"" button and select the host(s) for which you want to reset the SQL data.

6) Next run the ""2-FSAC Bulk Import"" which will send you a warning to let you know that it is resetting but it should run cleanly if it works.

** 7) IF this does not resolve your issue then follow the same steps but select ""Maintenance type"" = ""Repair"" on the ""Maintenance Selection"" mini-window.
+++++

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved.
The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

1) The data not displaying in AIC for some days last week may have been to a delay in data processing.
Everything in Stealthbits AIC (Netwrix AIC) looked good today.
You are not in the SteathAUDIT and AIC environments often (at this point in time).

2) In the new year (2025), you should submit separate tickets for the following upgrades:

a) Upgrade StealthAUDIT 11.5 to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6 - we should also perform a Netwrix AIC upgrade.
b) Upgrade StealthINTERCEPT (SI) 7.3.7 to Netwrix Threat Prevention (NTP) 7.3.9 or 7.4 and also upgrade NTM Reporting Module - additionally review your ST/NTP database maintenance job
c) Upgrade StealthDEFEND to the latest available version of Netwrix Threat Manager. 

As per our meeting today, I will close this case.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Hi Frank,

Now that the Repair ran successfully, you would need to run again in order:
 
1-FSAC System Scans
2-FSAC Bulk Import

Do you want me to send a meeting invite to you so that we can investigate this problem more closely in your environment?

Thank you,
Mike Candon

It ended up only taking an hour or so to complete the repair and it looks like the import job ran successfully.

 

However, when I go to the Stealthbits web page > Access > Resource Audit web page I see that Activity Details from 10/24/2024 to 10/31/2024 seems to be blank. I am looking at a folder that I know has activity and I queried the database directly and see the activity in there.

 

I had some similar issue like this recently.

 


Thanks,

Frank

Hi Frank,

1) I see from your email that the Repair tool did complete so this is better news at this time.

2) How long is the Repair option taking to complete?
Is it a couple (2) of hours or 8-10+ hours?
If if is 8-10+ hours in the future can you try to run it overnight by setting a Scheduled job?

3) In your installation directory = %SAInstallDir%FSAA (there is a folder called FSAA)
or something similar to: 
E:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA (as an example)

In this FSAA directory where you run the ""Reset Hosts"" option it will generate a log called ""2024_09_09T10_11_47ResetHosts.log"" (as an example).
In this FSAA directory where you run the ""Repair"" (hosts) option it will generate a log called ""2024_10_30T11_11_49RepairTool.log"" (as an example).

I do not believe that we need them now but please keep them in mind for future reference.


Thank you,

It did finally complete.

 

I am running the import now. So far it seems to be working, but I am waiting for it to complete.

 

I will keep you posted.

 


Thanks,

Frank

Great thanks!

 

I did the reset, but the bulk import still seemed to fail with the same error.

 

I am doing the repair option, but it seems to just stop at 20%. I am not sure if it just takes a long time to run or if it is stuck.

 


Thanks,

Frank

Hi Frank,

Using ""Reset Hosts"" should not cause data loss nor data duplication.

It also will have no effect on the other (NetApp) hosts.

+++++
NEA - Potential reasons for why we need to reset the GUID in the first place:
+++++
1) Usually  interrupted scans due to reboot or a job crash. 
2) Sometimes multiple scans on the same host at the same time attempting to run.
3) If you are using proxies or targeting windows hosts sometimes network issues can cause partial copy's of the tier 2 storage so when you import the data, it isn't as it should be.
+++++


Thank you,

Also, is there a way to determine what would cause this issue that we need to reset the GUID in the first place?

 


Thanks,

Thanks for the explanation and thanks for providing the link.

 

Will this cause any data loss, or does it just cause possible data duplication?

 

Also, in my environment, we have our NetApp displaying like this in the database (see screenshot) to resolve an issue and maintain previous data. I want to make sure this will not impact this or cause any further issues with this. There should be existing tickets that explains why things were done this way.

 

 




Thanks,

Frank

Hi Frank,


	Reset Hosts – Resets the Access GUID column value in the SA_FSAA_Hosts table for the Hosts selected. Allows data to be bulk imported when there is a GUID mismatch.


So then when you run your next bulk import it will attempt to do a full import of data regardless of whether the data is there or not.

Please see the following documentation:

Hi Mike,

 

Thanks for providing these steps. Before I take any action on this, could you explain exactly what “Reset Hosts” does?

 


Thanks,

Frank

Hi Frank,

Let me know if you would like to meet.
Here are the steps that should resolve your issue.
Please see the attached screenshot.

+++++
1) Open NEA

2) Navigate to: Jobs > FileSystem > ""0.Collection"" > ""1-FSAC System Scans"" > Configure > Queries

3) Click the ""Query Properties"" hyperlink and in the ""Query Properties"" mini-window, click the ""Configure"" button to open the ""File System Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard"".

4) Next in the ""File System Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard"" mini-window, click the ""Maintenance"" button.

5) Take the default option of ""Reset Hosts"" and click the ""Next"" button and select the host(s) for which you want to reset the SQL data.

6) Next run the ""2-FSAC Bulk Import"" which will send you a warning to let you know that it is resetting but it should run cleanly if it works.

** 7) IF this does not resolve your issue then follow the same steps but select ""Maintenance type"" = ""Repair"" on the ""Maintenance Selection"" mini-window.
+++++
