Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data"").

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

For share path: \eagle.usaa.comusaaLife_SIU_NAIC:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data"").

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!kajD3wR15fbWgR6INj-Bi7_eNSFVhwaq6RdDeyYQNly-CSBrKLHitqrODEDnzRdQB2IVdE3bBw5eNgmMQgS04Bso$>

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                            11.5.0.177
Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC)                  11.5.0.122

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data""). I downloaded the AIC diagnostic logs and am seeing the below in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

For share path: \eagle.usaa.comusaaLife_SIU_NAIC:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Hey Dusty,

It looks like the job got an ""access is denied"" error when trying to Enumerate the shares on TESTNAS2_2 and so the scan data for the test_A2019_share is still not there.

[cid:100a102a-bfaa-4b30-8c7a-daabfe93af73]

The job uses the same gMSA account, which should have permissions to enumerate the shares on the TESTNAS2_2 host.
[cid:2d12805b-5d3f-4506-899d-382834c28141]

Thanks,
Rich

Subject: Netwrix Support Ticket #413095 - FSAA Permissions Scan Errors

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data""). I downloaded the AIC diagnostic logs and am seeing the below in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!kajD3wR15fbWgR6INj-Bi7_eNSFVhwaq6RdDeyYQNly-CSBrKLHitqrODEDnzRdQB2IVdE3bBw5eNgmMQgS04Bso$>

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                            11.5.0.177
Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC)                  11.5.0.122

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data"").

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Good Morning Dusty,

I moved up the scheduled scan for the GROUP_FileSystem to run last night, but it still gave the same error, access is denied. Do you have time this morning to take another look to try and get the TEST2_2 host share scan data loaded? Is there a faster way to just scan that host and not any others? I only need that last share scan data loaded.

[cid:e6fc100f-fa25-4f2f-9b4e-3455a65121ff]

Thanks,
Rich

Rich,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                            11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!g_7wtD84CUelT3BFdX-R-je0mRS9yjmCcKGY8F3j7QzcqbJh5vpHGnzIzPP7SJX_bVMsZsRVv5Lj4YgvQ8kNsXTu$>

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Subject: Netwrix Support Ticket #413095 - FSAA Permissions Scan Errors

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data""). I downloaded the AIC diagnostic logs and am seeing the below in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!kajD3wR15fbWgR6INj-Bi7_eNSFVhwaq6RdDeyYQNly-CSBrKLHitqrODEDnzRdQB2IVdE3bBw5eNgmMQgS04Bso$>

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

If a Windows Server this commonly indicates that our connection profile account is not granted access to the target host “Power Users” group.

I do not recall the similar relation on NIX NAS based devices however the job/account are not able to fully access the share, which is resulting in the Windows Access is denied response.

Let's schedule a web meeting to take another look.

Good Morning Dusty,

 

I moved up the scheduled scan for the GROUP_FileSystem to run last night, but it still gave the same error, access is denied. Do you have time this morning to take another look to try and get the TEST2_2 host share scan data loaded? Is there a faster way to just scan that host and not any others? I only need that last share scan data loaded.

 



 


Thanks,

Rich

If the account is getting Access Denied, then there might be a NetApp restriction if the accounts both have the same rights within AD.

Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC)                   11.5.0.122

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data""). I downloaded the AIC diagnostic logs and am seeing the below in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

For share path: \eagle.usaa.comusaaLife_SIU_NAIC:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Thanks Dusty,

I chose the next available time for you, which is 8am central tomorrow morning. But is there possibly another Engineer that can take a look at this today? I need to try my best to get the data loaded today so that I can launch the review today.

Thanks,
Rich

Rich,

If a Windows Server this commonly indicates that our connection profile account is not granted access to the target host “Power Users” group.

I do not recall the similar relation on NIX NAS based devices however the job/account are not able to fully access the share, which is resulting in the Windows Access is denied response.

Let's schedule a web meeting to take another look.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Good Morning Dusty,

I moved up the scheduled scan for the GROUP_FileSystem to run last night, but it still gave the same error, access is denied. Do you have time this morning to take another look to try and get the TEST2_2 host share scan data loaded? Is there a faster way to just scan that host and not any others? I only need that last share scan data loaded.

Thanks,

Thank You for the update.

If the account is getting Access Denied, then there might be a NetApp restriction if the accounts both have the same rights within AD.

The account that is set in the Schedules listing is not the same as the account for the Jobs connection profile.

Rich,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                            11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!g_7wtD84CUelT3BFdX-R-je0mRS9yjmCcKGY8F3j7QzcqbJh5vpHGnzIzPP7SJX_bVMsZsRVv5Lj4YgvQ8kNsXTu$>

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Subject: Netwrix Support Ticket #413095 - FSAA Permissions Scan Errors

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data""). I downloaded the AIC diagnostic logs and am seeing the below in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!kajD3wR15fbWgR6INj-Bi7_eNSFVhwaq6RdDeyYQNly-CSBrKLHitqrODEDnzRdQB2IVdE3bBw5eNgmMQgS04Bso$>

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Thanks Dusty,

 

I chose the next available time for you, which is 8am central tomorrow morning. But is there possibly another Engineer that can take a look at this today? I need to try my best to get the data loaded today so that I can launch the review today.

Rich,

If a Windows Server this commonly indicates that our connection profile account is not granted access to the target host “Power Users” group.

I do not recall the similar relation on NIX NAS based devices however the job/account are not able to fully access the share, which is resulting in the Windows Access is denied response.

Let's schedule a web meeting to take another look.

Good Morning Dusty,

 

I moved up the scheduled scan for the GROUP_FileSystem to run last night, but it still gave the same error, access is denied. Do you have time this morning to take another look to try and get the TEST2_2 host share scan data loaded? Is there a faster way to just scan that host and not any others? I only need that last share scan data loaded.

 



 


Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

Thank You for the update.

If the account is getting Access Denied, then there might be a NetApp restriction if the accounts both have the same rights within AD.

Rich,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                             11.5.0.177
Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC)                   11.5.0.122

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data""). I downloaded the AIC diagnostic logs and am seeing the below in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Discovered that the account used to run the FSAA job is getting access denied on remote shares on the NetApp server. The account is part of the BUILTINAdmin group but does not have the Power Users or Backup Operators group membership roles. Suggested that the customer give the account those roles and run the job again.

Please provide an update with the results of the completed FSAA system scan. 

Thank you,

Thanks Dusty,

 

I chose the next available time for you, which is 8am central tomorrow morning. But is there possibly another Engineer that can take a look at this today? I need to try my best to get the data loaded today so that I can launch the review today.

Rich,

If a Windows Server this commonly indicates that our connection profile account is not granted access to the target host “Power Users” group.

I do not recall the similar relation on NIX NAS based devices however the job/account are not able to fully access the share, which is resulting in the Windows Access is denied response.

Let's schedule a web meeting to take another look.

Good Morning Dusty,

 

I moved up the scheduled scan for the GROUP_FileSystem to run last night, but it still gave the same error, access is denied. Do you have time this morning to take another look to try and get the TEST2_2 host share scan data loaded? Is there a faster way to just scan that host and not any others? I only need that last share scan data loaded.

 



 


Thanks,

Rich

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                             11.5.0.177
Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC)                   11.5.0.122

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data"").

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Thank you Scottie,

I appreciate all your help today. The scans completed and I saw some errors on paths, but not for the share I'm trying to scan. I ran the bulk import job pointing to just the TESTNAS2_2 host and it completed successfully! 🙂

However, I'm still seeing the same behavior on the AIC, where it's saying there is no scan data for the share.

So, I've scheduled the GROUP_FileSystem job group to start in a couple of minutes. I'm thinking maybe that whole group needs to run for the AIC to see the scan data.

Thanks,
Rich

Hi Rich,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Discovered that the account used to run the FSAA job is getting access denied on remote shares on the NetApp server. The account is part of the BUILTINAdmin group but does not have the Power Users or Backup Operators group membership roles. Suggested that the customer give the account those roles and run the job again.

Please provide an update with the results of the completed FSAA system scan.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Thanks Dusty,

I chose the next available time for you, which is 8am central tomorrow morning. But is there possibly another Engineer that can take a look at this today? I need to try my best to get the data loaded today so that I can launch the review today.

Thanks,
Rich

Rich,

If a Windows Server this commonly indicates that our connection profile account is not granted access to the target host “Power Users” group.

I do not recall the similar relation on NIX NAS based devices however the job/account are not able to fully access the share, which is resulting in the Windows Access is denied response.

Let's schedule a web meeting to take another look.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Good Morning Dusty,

I moved up the scheduled scan for the GROUP_FileSystem to run last night, but it still gave the same error, access is denied. Do you have time this morning to take another look to try and get the TEST2_2 host share scan data loaded? Is there a faster way to just scan that host and not any others? I only need that last share scan data loaded.

Thanks,

Thank You for the update.

If the account is getting Access Denied, then there might be a NetApp restriction if the accounts both have the same rights within AD.

Rich,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                            11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!g_7wtD84CUelT3BFdX-R-je0mRS9yjmCcKGY8F3j7QzcqbJh5vpHGnzIzPP7SJX_bVMsZsRVv5Lj4YgvQ8kNsXTu$>

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Subject: Netwrix Support Ticket #413095 - FSAA Permissions Scan Errors

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data""). I downloaded the AIC diagnostic logs and am seeing the below in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!kajD3wR15fbWgR6INj-Bi7_eNSFVhwaq6RdDeyYQNly-CSBrKLHitqrODEDnzRdQB2IVdE3bBw5eNgmMQgS04Bso$>

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Thank you Scottie,

 

I appreciate all your help today. The scans completed and I saw some errors on paths, but not for the share I'm trying to scan. I ran the bulk import job pointing to just the TESTNAS2_2 host and it completed successfully! 🙂

 

However, I'm still seeing the same behavior on the AIC, where it's saying there is no scan data for the share.

 

So, I've scheduled the GROUP_FileSystem job group to start in a couple of minutes. I'm thinking maybe that whole group needs to run for the AIC to see the scan data.

 


Thanks,

Rich

Hi Rich,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Discovered that the account used to run the FSAA job is getting access denied on remote shares on the NetApp server. The account is part of the BUILTINAdmin group but does not have the Power Users or Backup Operators group membership roles. Suggested that the customer give the account those roles and run the job again.

Please provide an update with the results of the completed FSAA system scan. 

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor
Technical Support Engineer

Thanks Dusty,

 

I chose the next available time for you, which is 8am central tomorrow morning. But is there possibly another Engineer that can take a look at this today? I need to try my best to get the data loaded today so that I can launch the review today.

 


Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

If a Windows Server this commonly indicates that our connection profile account is not granted access to the target host “Power Users” group.

I do not recall the similar relation on NIX NAS based devices however the job/account are not able to fully access the share, which is resulting in the Windows Access is denied response.

Let's schedule a web meeting to take another look.

Good Morning Dusty,

 

I moved up the scheduled scan for the GROUP_FileSystem to run last night, but it still gave the same error, access is denied. Do you have time this morning to take another look to try and get the TEST2_2 host share scan data loaded? Is there a faster way to just scan that host and not any others? I only need that last share scan data loaded.

 



 


Thanks,

Rich

Rich,

Thank You for the update.

If the account is getting Access Denied, then there might be a NetApp restriction if the accounts both have the same rights within AD.

The account that is set in the Schedules listing is not the same as the account for the Jobs connection profile.

Rich,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                             11.5.0.177
Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC)                   11.5.0.122

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data""). I downloaded the AIC diagnostic logs and am seeing the below in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

For share path: \eagle.usaa.comusaaLife_SIU_NAIC:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Good Morning Dusty, Scottie and Taylor,

Success! After the GROUP_FileSystem job group completed, the AIC now has scan data for the share 🙂. So, I think having the Storage team add the accounts to the Power Users and Backup Operators local groups for the TESTNAS2_2 host and then running the GROUP_FileSystem job did the trick.

Thank you guys for all your help, I truly appreciate it!

Thanks,
Rich

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Thank you Scottie,

I appreciate all your help today. The scans completed and I saw some errors on paths, but not for the share I'm trying to scan. I ran the bulk import job pointing to just the TESTNAS2_2 host and it completed successfully! ?

However, I'm still seeing the same behavior on the AIC, where it's saying there is no scan data for the share.

So, I've scheduled the GROUP_FileSystem job group to start in a couple of minutes. I'm thinking maybe that whole group needs to run for the AIC to see the scan data.

Thanks,
Rich

Hi Rich,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Discovered that the account used to run the FSAA job is getting access denied on remote shares on the NetApp server. The account is part of the BUILTINAdmin group but does not have the Power Users or Backup Operators group membership roles. Suggested that the customer give the account those roles and run the job again.

Please provide an update with the results of the completed FSAA system scan.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor
Technical Support Engineer

Rich,

If a Windows Server this commonly indicates that our connection profile account is not granted access to the target host “Power Users” group.

I do not recall the similar relation on NIX NAS based devices however the job/account are not able to fully access the share, which is resulting in the Windows Access is denied response.

Let's schedule a web meeting to take another look.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Good Morning Dusty,

I moved up the scheduled scan for the GROUP_FileSystem to run last night, but it still gave the same error, access is denied. Do you have time this morning to take another look to try and get the TEST2_2 host share scan data loaded? Is there a faster way to just scan that host and not any others? I only need that last share scan data loaded.

Thanks,
Rich

Rich,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                            11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!g_7wtD84CUelT3BFdX-R-je0mRS9yjmCcKGY8F3j7QzcqbJh5vpHGnzIzPP7SJX_bVMsZsRVv5Lj4YgvQ8kNsXTu$>

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Subject: Netwrix Support Ticket #413095 - FSAA Permissions Scan Errors

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data""). I downloaded the AIC diagnostic logs and am seeing the below in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!kajD3wR15fbWgR6INj-Bi7_eNSFVhwaq6RdDeyYQNly-CSBrKLHitqrODEDnzRdQB2IVdE3bBw5eNgmMQgS04Bso$>

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Good Morning Dusty, Scottie and Taylor,

Success! After the GROUP_FileSystem job group completed, the AIC now has scan data for the share 🙂. So, I think having the Storage team add the accounts to the Power Users and Backup Operators local groups for the TESTNAS2_2 host and then running the GROUP_FileSystem job did the trick.

Thank you guys for all your help, I truly appreciate it!

Thanks,
Rich

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref
Thank you Scottie,

I appreciate all your help today. The scans completed and I saw some errors on paths, but not for the share I'm trying to scan. I ran the bulk import job pointing to just the TESTNAS2_2 host and it completed successfully! ?

However, I'm still seeing the same behavior on the AIC, where it's saying there is no scan data for the share.

So, I've scheduled the GROUP_FileSystem job group to start in a couple of minutes. I'm thinking maybe that whole group needs to run for the AIC to see the scan data.

Thanks,
Rich

Hi Rich,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Discovered that the account used to run the FSAA job is getting access denied on remote shares on the NetApp server. The account is part of the BUILTINAdmin group but does not have the Power Users or Backup Operators group membership roles. Suggested that the customer give the account those roles and run the job again.

Please provide an update with the results of the completed FSAA system scan.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Thanks Dusty,

I chose the next available time for you, which is 8am central tomorrow morning. But is there possibly another Engineer that can take a look at this today? I need to try my best to get the data loaded today so that I can launch the review today.

Thanks,
Rich

Rich,

If a Windows Server this commonly indicates that our connection profile account is not granted access to the target host “Power Users” group.

I do not recall the similar relation on NIX NAS based devices however the job/account are not able to fully access the share, which is resulting in the Windows Access is denied response.

Let's schedule a web meeting to take another look.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Good Morning Dusty,

I moved up the scheduled scan for the GROUP_FileSystem to run last night, but it still gave the same error, access is denied. Do you have time this morning to take another look to try and get the TEST2_2 host share scan data loaded? Is there a faster way to just scan that host and not any others? I only need that last share scan data loaded.

Thanks,
Rich

Rich,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                            11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!g_7wtD84CUelT3BFdX-R-je0mRS9yjmCcKGY8F3j7QzcqbJh5vpHGnzIzPP7SJX_bVMsZsRVv5Lj4YgvQ8kNsXTu$>

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test<file://eagle.usaa.com/idtn_test/> test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test<file://testnas2_2.usaa.com/usaa_test/> test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share<file://eagle.usaa.com/idtn_test/test_A2019_share> resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data""). I downloaded the AIC diagnostic logs and am seeing the below in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177<https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/11.5.0.177__;!!A4_5A80JmIXQLQ!kajD3wR15fbWgR6INj-Bi7_eNSFVhwaq6RdDeyYQNly-CSBrKLHitqrODEDnzRdQB2IVdE3bBw5eNgmMQgS04Bso$>

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Good Morning Dusty, Scottie and Taylor,



 



Success! After the GROUP_FileSystem job group completed, the AIC now has scan data for the share 🙂. So, I think having the Storage team add the accounts to the Power Users and Backup Operators local groups for the TESTNAS2_2 host and then running the GROUP_FileSystem job did the trick.



 



Thank you guys for all your help, I truly appreciate it!



 




Thanks,



Rich

Thank you Scottie,



 



I appreciate all your help today. The scans completed and I saw some errors on paths, but not for the share I'm trying to scan. I ran the bulk import job pointing to just the TESTNAS2_2 host and it completed successfully! ?



 



However, I'm still seeing the same behavior on the AIC, where it's saying there is no scan data for the share.



 



So, I've scheduled the GROUP_FileSystem job group to start in a couple of minutes. I'm thinking maybe that whole group needs to run for the AIC to see the scan data.



 




Thanks,



Rich

Hi Rich,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Discovered that the account used to run the FSAA job is getting access denied on remote shares on the NetApp server. The account is part of the BUILTINAdmin group but does not have the Power Users or Backup Operators group membership roles. Suggested that the customer give the account those roles and run the job again.

Please provide an update with the results of the completed FSAA system scan. 

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor
Technical Support Engineer

Thanks Dusty,



 



I chose the next available time for you, which is 8am central tomorrow morning. But is there possibly another Engineer that can take a look at this today? I need to try my best to get the data loaded today so that I can launch the review today.



 




Thanks,

Rich,

If a Windows Server this commonly indicates that our connection profile account is not granted access to the target host “Power Users” group.

I do not recall the similar relation on NIX NAS based devices however the job/account are not able to fully access the share, which is resulting in the Windows Access is denied response.

Let's schedule a web meeting to take another look.

Good Morning Dusty,



 



I moved up the scheduled scan for the GROUP_FileSystem to run last night, but it still gave the same error, access is denied. Do you have time this morning to take another look to try and get the TEST2_2 host share scan data loaded? Is there a faster way to just scan that host and not any others? I only need that last share scan data loaded.



 







 




Thanks,



Rich

Thank You for the update.

If the account is getting Access Denied, then there might be a NetApp restriction if the accounts both have the same rights within AD.

Rich,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                             11.5.0.177
Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC)                   11.5.0.122

We looked a the corrected FSAA job

\eagle.usaa.comidtn_test test_A2019_share    which relates to    \testnas2_2.usaa.comusaa_test test_A2019_share

We found that the needed host was not part of the expected host list, to temporarily adjust we added the needed host to the Jobs Individual host table to include the original Netapp By IP host list.

Kicked off the needed FSAA job once complete we will need to run the Jobs > FileSystem > Reporting scheduled task.

Please let me know how the next set of jobs complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CK74r:ref

Hello Dusty,

Can we setup a zoom meeting today (7/8) or tomorrow (7/9)? One of the resources has no scan data, and I need to ensure it has scan data before I launch the review on Wednesday (7/10).

I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up the  \eagle.usaa.comidtn_testtest_A2019_share resource and I get an error when trying to create a review for it (""At least one item selected does not have scan data""). I downloaded the AIC diagnostic logs and am seeing the below in the aic.log file:

Hello Dusty,

Thank you for following up. I looked at the jobs and I think all is well, but I'm not sure and wanted to see if we can setup another meeting for you to double check.

Also, I see a 400 error in the AIC when I try looking up 2 resources and am worried it may not have ACL data for them for the resource review. I downloaded the diagnostic logs and am seeing these errors in the aic.log file:

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.177

Noted that the FSAA job was somehow set top the FSAC scan settings.

This was corrected.

We set a new schedule to run down the FileSystem Job Group for a Friday kickoff at 5pm CT/host time.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.
