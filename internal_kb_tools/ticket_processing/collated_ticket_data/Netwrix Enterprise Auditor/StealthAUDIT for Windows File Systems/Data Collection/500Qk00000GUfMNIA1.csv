1) If you drill down into NEA > Jobs > FileSystem > 0.Collection > 0-Create Schema, right-click 
and select ""Run Job"" are you able to run the job successfully as indicated by the ""Job Statistics"" 
that I have additionally highlighted in the attached screenshot = ""SS01_NEA_FileSystem_0.Collection_0-Create_Schema_Run_Job_SS_2024-10-01_134716.png""

2) In the second attached screenshot, if you drill down to ""Results"" > ""FSAA_DirectPremissionsView"" this should display one example of data that may also indicate that the job is running successfully.

+++++
Scenarios for why we need to run ""Create Schema"" standalone.
+++++

1) Typically it's only necessary after an upgrade or if you drop all the file system data in order to create the file system schema.

2) There are changes that occur between versions as well where it has been required also.

3) It used to be only necessary when upgrading to a major release, however we have had many cases where we've had to run it after a ""cumulative update"" installation because there were schema changes.  Cumulative Updates are the the update releases that come out roughly each week.","Guidance","Mike Candon","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Data Collection","11.6","","16.2","Closed - Resolved","W.R.
