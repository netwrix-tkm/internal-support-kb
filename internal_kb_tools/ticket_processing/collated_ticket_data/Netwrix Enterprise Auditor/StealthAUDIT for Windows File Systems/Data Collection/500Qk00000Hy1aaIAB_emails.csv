Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. I understand your File System Activity scan is currently failing. 

To begin troubleshooting, please collect debug logs from the job:

	Right-click the All Activity job and select Properties
	Use the Log Level dropdown and set it to DEBUG
	
		If the log level was not already set to DEBUG, please rerun the job after setting
	
	
	Collect the job logs by right-clicking the All Activity job and selecting Export
	Upload the zipped archive to the ticket in the Netwrix Customer Portal


In the meantime, please increase the log retention level for the file servers on the Monitored Hosts tab in Netwrix Activity Monitor while we investigate:

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our remote session:

	FSAC System Scan error ""No Row at Position 0.""
	
		We installed a hotfix to the NEA server and then ran the FS_UpdateProxies job against the East Proxy 5 server
	
	
	FSAC System Scan error ""Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied""
	
		We set the Applet Launch Mechanism in the query settings for the FSAC System Scan
	
	
	It appears that the scans have been failing since around 8/14, so unfortunately we missed the activity on 8/31. However, the data for 11/4 looks to be available in Netwrix Activity Monitor
	
		We exported this search as a csv
	
	
	Once the FSAC System Scan and FSAC Bulk Import finish for East Proxy 5, the activity data should be available in the AIC
	We scheduled the FS_UpdateProxies job to run at 5:00pm ET to update the FSAA Proxy service on the other proxy servers
	We imported the SAS_ExecutionStatistics job from the Instant Job library and scheduled it to run 11/6 @ midnight. Once this job runs, you should get a report with the status of collection jobs.

Let me know how things look once that scan and bulk import complete!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, the errors we're seeing regarding locked database files is due to the all the FSAA system scan jobs pointing at the wrong host list. We set each proxy folder to use it's respective host list and will take a look how things complete over the weekend.

Let me know how those scans look monday!

Thank you,

Hello Tay

The jobs ran over the weekend and some worked and some did not

The error is the same on all the failures.

Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.FSAAException: Unable to start scan: Proxy host list is either empty or no proxies were configured to scan the target host

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.ActivityScanTask.<InternalProcessRecordAsync>d__2.MoveNext()

--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---

   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.ThrowForNonSuccess(Task task)

   at System.Runtime.CompilerServices.TaskAwaiter.HandleNonSuccessAndDebuggerNotification(Task task)

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.ActivityScanTask.InternalProcessRecord()

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()

 

 

I checked the host lists on all jobs and they are pointing to the correct list. The error seems odd unless I am missing something here

 


Thanks

 

Jason

Thank you for meeting with today. To recap our session:

Erroring Jobs 


	FSAC System Scans for DC East 2, 4, & 6: ""Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied""
	FSAC System Scans for DC West 2, 4, & 6: ""Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied""

Corrections Made


	Set the Applet Launch mechanism in the job's query settings to ""Require applet to be running as a service on target""



After making corrections on the jobs, we kicked a few of them off and watched them connect correctly to their respective proxy.

Let me know how the jobs look in the morning and if we have any other errors to address!

Thank you,
Tay Caliguiri

Hey Jason,

Open the query settings and take a peek at the scan server selection page- this is where the proxy that is being used is set:


Let me know what that looks like and if you need any assistance configuring it!

Thank you,
