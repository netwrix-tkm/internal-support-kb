Hello Support Team,

After upgrading customer to latest versions as of 12/20/2024, FSAA is now not completing, and the rest of the jobs do not even start past bulk import. We upgraded to resolve issue described in case 00422386, seems to be still related however now affecting FSAA. The logs do not appear to show anything much. Task scheduler says exit code 0 returned after bulk import attempts. FSAA system scan time is 0 seconds (typically see this if the job is terminated unexpectedly).

I'm not really sure where to start with this one, it's super strange and hard to follow since we have a proxy involved, lots of servers, and some of those servers have millions+ files.

Server,Software,Version
ConsoleServer,Netwrix Enterprise Auditor V11.6,11.6.0.125
ConsoleServer,Netwrix Access Information Center,11.6.0.25
ConsoleServer,Netwrix Activity Monitor Agent 64-bit,7.1.234
ConsoleServer,Netwrix Activity Monitor,7.1.234
ConsoleServer,Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On V11.6,11.6.0.14
ProxyServer,Netwrix Enterprise Auditor File System Scanning Proxy,11.6.0.36
ProxyServer,Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On V11.6,11.6.0.14

Please let me know best next steps.

Thank you,
Justin.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-31T04:48:52.000Z"

The problem host (HS1MP1) was still &quot;verifiying database&quot; at the end of the call (almost an hour after starting based on the log). Since it&#39;s a 32GB db, we&#39;re going to give it a little time to finish. If it doesn&#39;t finish/we run into the issue again- Justin is going to remove the running.lck file (if present) and rename the the *_StatsFSAA, *_Prop, *_StrucFSAA, &amp; *_ScopingFSAA t2s on the proxy and try a fresh scan of the host to rule out any corruption in them.</p>","","","","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2025-01-10T20:58:57.000Z"

1. Add FSAAScanHost.exe to AV exclusions
2. Limit FSAA to only scan two hosts at a time
3. HSP1M1 file server, add scoping to skip a few paths since those files rapidly change on a daily basis
