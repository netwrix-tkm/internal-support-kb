"500Qk00000E2QWDIA3","00417114","Support Ticket","File System Schedule Tasks stop running after a couple minutes","All of my File System Schedule Tasks (FSAA, FSAC, and SEEK) stop running after a couple of minutes leaving a <a href='https://running.lck' target='_blank'>running.lck</a> file. If I manually run the jobs in the console then they will run to completion fine but the same jobs will not run via scheduled tasks. They were running fine via scheduled tasks until Friday July 26th jobs (I was on vacation for 2 weeks so no changes were made to the system during that time frame to cause the issue). I updated to Enterprise Auditor - Version 11.6.0.86 on July 30th and then updated again to Enterprise Auditor - Version 11.6.0.88 today (August 5th). I've tried deleting one of the scheduled tasks and recreating but it still will not run correctly.","","","","Issue was 3rd party Security tool update Trellix (formerly McAfee),","Third-party system failure","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Data Collection","11.6","","14.1","Closed - Resolved","KBR, Inc.
