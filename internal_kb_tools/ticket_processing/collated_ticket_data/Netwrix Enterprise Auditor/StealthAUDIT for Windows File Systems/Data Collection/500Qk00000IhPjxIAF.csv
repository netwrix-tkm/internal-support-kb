We have a solution in place to do remote scanning as we do not have an agent on the UK domain controller. 

I believe the set up we have now is out of date and there is a better way to be doing this. Is there any documentation you can share for better ways to do this remote scanning?","Win File Cluster issue, unable to replicate in lab.","Two node Windows File Server cluster (Active Passive) Fails when running scan via Local or Applet mode.

Ensure ports 8767 and 8766 are added to the host firewall settings. The IP of the NEA host had changed this was the root of the issue.
