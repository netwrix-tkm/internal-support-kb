In regard to the step 18 SQL query, the performance will be roughly proportional to the size of their resource table. Internally, we tested this with the following, which completed the entire job in about 10 minutes
101 hosts
25 million resources
1500 trustees
70k gates
After checking the resource table for the customer, I would also advise looking at the query plan for the running query after about 10 minutes to see if it's doing anything out of the ordinary (From SSMS you can do that from the 'activity monitor' for either ""Recent Expensive Queries"", ""Active Expensive Queries"" or right clicking and selecting ""Show Execution Plan"".
