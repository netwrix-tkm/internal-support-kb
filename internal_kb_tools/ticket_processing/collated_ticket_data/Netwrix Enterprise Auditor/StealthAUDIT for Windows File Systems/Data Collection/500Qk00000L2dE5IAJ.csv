"500Qk00000L2dE5IAJ","00433500","Support Ticket","Filesystem permissions report returning historical (old) data","Returning to previous issue from ticket 412503. NEA showing historical data in scans. Scans are set to only 5 levels and need to go to at least 8 levels. John Deere will need assistance making these changes and setting up the scans, plus follow up review.","","Current FileSystem details in question is limited to 3 lvl deep so the scans are not updating the objects below this lvl.


> What is the impact of the issue on your business? 
We can't rely on the data for current use cases.

> Who is affected by this issue? 
Auditors, and anyone else who may have valid use cases for the data.

> When did this issue start?  
Unknown. Most likely, for a long time (multiple years). The product has always been lacking administrative attention in our company.","Dropped data for the flagged host, a Rescan will be ran then a follow-up email will be requested.","Symptom:
Deleted Items no updating with in the AIC.
Cause:
The FSAA Scans were no longer scanning to the same or lower depths where the File System objects lived to note that they had been deleted.
	Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) FSAA scans repopulated host path(s) post dropping SQL details for the host in question.
	Part of the issue was that the old paths were still in the local Tier2 SQLite DBs
Resolution:
Confirmed via the UNC path that the folder in question does not exist.

Utilized the FSAA Remove host option for the Data Collector: 
Remove Host Data – Removes host from all SQL tables created by the FSAA Data Collector and deletes SturcMap (removes host assigned to job where query exists), until the FSAA re-scan completed for the same host.

“Drop Data” for the Tier2 DBs the fasted cleanest option is to rename/remove the Host folder from the FSAA paths on the NEA host and the Proxy Server (if in use).

Post the Remove Host data job completion: The host and all paths were cleared from the AIC view 

Scan level (depth) FSAA scan example of a one level deep \HOSTShareFolder  ( \HOSTC$Folder1folder2ShareFolder still one folder deep)
 
***NOTE*** Scans are non-destructive to the data that had been collected and if an object is deleted the new scan will add a value to the DeleteUSN….
For Select host we would like to clean up we will need to run the FSAA Maintenance Remove Host Data This will remove the related data from the SQL server (aka Tier 1) DB.
Then for the Local Tier 2 DBs (SQLIte) the fasted cleanest option will be to rename/remove the Host folder from the FSAA paths on the NEA host and the Proxy Server.

Alternatively, we have a full purge option for the data within the SQl server

If it becomes necessary to clear all the FSAA Data Collector tables and views to resolve an issue, the FS_DropTables Job is preconfigured to run analysis tasks that drop functions and views for the File System Solution as well as the standard tables and views generated by the FSAA Data Collector.
