Our FSAA and FS_SEEK collection jobs crash ungracefully, leave behind the running.lck file, and cause a .net crash on our NEA server. I am not able to recreate this in my lab as this seems to be in client environment only. Client does have Crowdstrike but has check multiple times and does not find any blocks happening. I have uploaded logs, and screen shots of .net error.

We did try to upgrade to latest NEA and SDD but .net error persisted.

FSAA/FS_SEEK collections would be able to finish with out causing .net error to happen.


I am not able to recreate this in my lab, as this does seem to be in client environment only. I did try a windows collection in my lab but did not experience this.","","","","0050g000006QqyEAAS","2025-03-26T16:53:38.000Z"
