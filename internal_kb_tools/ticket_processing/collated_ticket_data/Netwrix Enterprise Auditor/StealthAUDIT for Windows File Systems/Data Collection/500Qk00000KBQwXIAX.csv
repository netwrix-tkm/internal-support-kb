We are getting the following error when running the scan portion of the filesystem Activity collection Job in Enterprise Auditor. 

Error getting scan database from execution host: Unable to read data from the transport connection: The connection was closed.","","+++++

1) NEA was upgrade to version 11.6 on Thursday, 06-Feb-2025.
 
2) There was a Upgrade done on Thursday. I was able to finish the incomplete File System Activity jobs after I manually moved the data to the server, but I have not yet tried a complete run from the start of the schedule without moving the data first.

3) I have a couple other jobs that are failing, and I am trying to get them caught up before doing another run of the 'FileSystem Activity' Job. I will let you know when I am finally caught up and can retest the activity job. Might not be until later this week.

2024_0107: We met today and here is a summary of the meeting:
+++++
1) IS-TEST and IS-FS2 are hosts feeding through a proxy server which error in the ""1-FSAC System Scans EMC"" job.

2) On 2 of the proxy servers we navigated to the following folder:

E:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA

We sorted by type and found old *.tmp files that we deleted for IS-TEST.
We also confirmed that the customer has adequate disk space.

3) On the customer's FSA Proxy server, the folders for IS-TEST and IS-FS2 had multiple files that appear when copies fail and have a variety of fabricated file extensions.
These files are junk and can occupy up large amounts of disk space unnecessarily.  We deleted multiple occurrences of these files in the IS-TEST and IS-PROD directories on the FSA Proxy server.

4) On the FSA Proxy server, we also navigated up to the ""FSAA"" directory and re-named the IS-FS2 and IS-TEST directories as IS-FS2_OLD and IS-TEST_OLD so that new directories will be created on the next run.
We also deleted any ""*Failed.zip"" files (IS-FS2Failed.zip as an example) in these directories.

5) The schedules for these jobs were running right now and would take another day or so so we will let them finish and they start roughly every 6 hours for 3-4 days of the week. 

6) The customer will reach out to use through the case once the next run has begun executing and/or completes successfully.
