""No Row at Position 0."" --debug message linked to ""Unable to connect to secure stream""
--- We installed HF 11.6.0.57 and then updated the proxy server with the FS_UpdateProxy job

""Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied""
--- We set the Applet Launch Mechanism to ""Require applet to be running as a service on target""

Customer needed data from 8/31 and 11/4. Looks like the jobs have been erroring since 8/14., so we don't have data on the 8/31 date, but we do have data for the 11/4 (NAM retention 10 days)

We also discussed how to use the NAM console to investigate and export results.

At the end of our session, the FSAC scan had successfully run on 3/4 hosts with the last host compressing and sending over T2s. Bulk Import is scheduled to run after.","","","","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2024-11-06T21:24:16.000Z"
