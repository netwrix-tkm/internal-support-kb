This is the new ticket for the issue you are experiencing where a few of your FSAA scans are stalled in ""Running"" status even though their duration reports blank.

Could you check if there is another ""running.lck"" file in the FSAA jobs folder?



Also, are there any obvious similarities between the file servers having the issue?
For example, old OS version or different subnet form the rest of the file servers.

I believe we already put the job in Debug mode. Please confirm by checking the properties of the job:







If it's already in debug, please just export the job, include all job components and attach the resulting .ZIP file to the ticket here: https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html#/tickets/open

.

If it's not in Debug already, please set it to debug, make sure the job isn't showing as running in Running Instances, delete that ""running.lck"" file, then start the job–just like we did in our last meeting.

Thank you,
