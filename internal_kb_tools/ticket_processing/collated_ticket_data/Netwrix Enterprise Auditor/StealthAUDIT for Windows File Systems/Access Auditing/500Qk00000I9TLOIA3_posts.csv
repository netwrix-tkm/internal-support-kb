 It looks like ML-PI3RCRD-S121 gets 79% done but then vanishes from the log. SHQFL001 does scan 100% but may not be ending gracefully.","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-11-25T19:45:49.000Z"

check the timing of the job
there could be something affecting it such as backup

double check Task Manager
-check for hung processes
-or just reboot","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-11-26T16:18:19.000Z"

---------------
investigating the bulk imports, it seems like the servers are actually finishing and uploading
this might just be a UI issue

We ran a test on ML-P13RCRD-S121
-it seems to be working

client will kick off the FSAA scan again when the current SEEK scan finishes
27 days and counting
