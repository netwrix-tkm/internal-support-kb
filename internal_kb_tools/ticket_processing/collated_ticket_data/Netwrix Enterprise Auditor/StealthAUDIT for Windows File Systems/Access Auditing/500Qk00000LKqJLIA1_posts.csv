Ran Tay's suggested plan. Scans seem to be working but previously they failed after multiple runs so we are waiting before we determine the issue is fixed.

Uninstalled the NEA console server.
Rebooted the console server.
Reinstalled to a new directory.
Ran the upgrade mode after reinstall.
Enabled debug logging.
Started FSAA scans.","","","","005Qk000002AJWTIA4","2025-02-03T23:22:07.000Z"
