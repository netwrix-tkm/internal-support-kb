We have reviewed your environment and jobs, and found out using the following command
 
Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:LocalMachineMy | Where-Object { $_.Thumbprint -eq ""YOUR_THUMBPRINT_HERE"" }

That the certificate with this thumbprint does not exist. We checked a working machine and there is a certificate in a store we can't access. Regardless of that I advised you to contact your Security Team to provide you with a valid .pfx file that can be used in Query Properties > Applet, custom certificate, which will need to be added to the endpoint machine as well.","","","","0054u000007ow49AAA","2025-02-12T10:26:36.000Z"
