Hi Tay,

Sorry for the radio silence. We’re still working through checking our firewalls with our Network team. I don’t have an ETA for completion but I’m hoping we can get this done within the next couple weeks as we think we were able to identify the cause.

Thanks for checking in!

Thank you for your patience as we investigated this issue. Since the next steps involve coordination with your networking team, which may take some time, we’ll go ahead and close this ticket for now. If the issue persists after the firewall rule has been applied, you can easily reopen the ticket within 30 days, and we’ll be ready to assist further.


Here is a summary of our findings:

Symptom:
Failed to connect to \{HOST}IPC$: The specified network name is no longer available during the FSAA System Scan.

Cause:
This error is occurring because the NEA scan server (proxy server) is unable to reach the target host's IPC$ share due to SMB traffic over port 445/tcp being blocked.

Resolution:
To resolve this, a firewall rule will need to be implemented to allow SMB (445/tcp) traffic between the NEA scan server and the target file system.


Thanks again for working through this with us.

Have a great weekend,
Tay Caliguiri

Senior Technical Support Engineer

Two weeks is my best guess if all goes to plan. I’d estimate a month is more realistic.

Hey Paul,

Do you happen to have an eta on when you believe those ports will be opened? Are you confident we'll be good to go within the next 2 weeks?

Thank you,
