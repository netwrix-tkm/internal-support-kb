Hi there,

 

Looks like the scan completed however the last import date still shows the same from 2021.  I noticed an error message about Tier 2 database not matching Tier 1 data.

Today we:

Hey Ian,

We’ve been dealing with slowness at random branches so we paused the import out of precaution before the finger gets pointed at us.  Once we’ve resolved our internal issue I will kick the import off again.  I’d say at this time we can close this case.

Thank you for your time and patience on this issue and I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved for you. 
The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Issue:
AIC showing last scan was from 2021

Cause:
FSAA scans have been disabled and have not run since 2021.

Resolution:
We enabled the FSAA scan and set it up to run on a schedule. Cleared T2 database data to allow bulk import to proceed.

At this time I will be closing your ticket out for you. This case can be re-opened at any time if any related issues return. 
Please feel free to reach out to the Netwrix team if you have any additional questions or would like assistance with any issues. Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case has been closed.
You will also receive a survey link, it would help us greatly to improve our support service if you could provide any feedback that you may have regarding your experience with this case.
