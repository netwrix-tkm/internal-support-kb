Customer is experiencing issues with FSAA BulkImport job for the NAS device to which customer refers to as SG NAS. 

The Bulk Import job is failing due to a timeout error. 
Customer provided debug logs.

According to the logs, the Bulk Import was stopped after running for around 32 minutes, which is not even close to the default SQL timeout of 24 hours. 

The timeout error customer referred to - is the timeout for the Job session abort. What is more, the job session status shows that the job received an abort request, which means that either job was started manually, and the console was then closed, or the job started on schedule and was then stopped:
MSG_TYPE   TableName   MESSAGE    TaskName

WARNING    Access    Abort request received   

ERROR        Host process was terminated (DC did not abort timely)   Bulk import


Customer replied that they run maintenance on the FSAA job using Maintenance Wizard as described in this article (Maintenance Wizard part)
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/QuerySelection.htm

And after that they restarted the job.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2024-11-22T10:14:15.000Z"

And each time it takes exactly 3 seconds after this operation starts before the timeout appears. 

As such, support assisted customer during meeting by starting ""Repair"" job for the ""SVRSG001SIN0002"" host via File System data collector query properties. 

However, repair operation also failed.
