FSAA scan failing after 3 hours

the only change we made was enable partial bulk imports

The latest bulk import didn't even try to start
-It looks like this is because the FSAA system scan failed to complete. 

Most recent FSAA System Scan failed after only a couple hours
-previous scans took a couple days
-scan time has been increasing as depth has increased, as expected
-currently set to 8 levels deep
Errors identified:
Bulk import error:
""Host is offline""
-This is expected for a server that appears to have been decommissioned.

Error in Application log on Netwrix Server:
.NET runtime ""unhandled exception"" error with StealthAUDIT.exe
-This appears to be what killed the most recent scan

FSAA System Scan job error:
""Error 110 parsing tags the system cannot open the device or files specified"" - Path to file
-This is a common error when scanning related to file access at the time of the scan
Changes made:
Bulk import:
-disabled skipping over hosts that don't respond to ping
-enabled uploading partial scans
--This way, the bulk import should run even if the FSAA System Scan fails to fully complete

This is unrelated to the FSAA scan issues, but we did make a change in Netwrix Activity Monitor.
-Changed the monitored Hosts to report their host name as FQND
-This is important for when you enable FSAC (File Activity) auditing","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-11-12T14:34:38.000Z"
