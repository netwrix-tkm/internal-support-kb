**Current Issue**
NEA v11.6.0.65
FSAA Proxy v11.6.0.16 (local system)
SDD v11.6.0.9

**Troubleshooting Completed during Meeting**
- 0.Collection SWR ALL (FSAA) - There is no row at position 0.
--- This is happening on more than 50% of servers being scanned, the other half are completing successfully
--- This looks to be caused by a certificate failure
----- Removed all LocalSystem (proxy) and MHD-SR-Stealthbits (NEA Console) user certificates 
- Recommendation to upgrade FSAA Proxy & SDD (and NEA, but customer is currently in a change freeze)
- Enabled partial import for FSAA
- Ran test scan against 1 host - HUGVAPPVYNMS002

**Problem Statement/Business Impact**
FSAA and SDD Proxy scans have more than half the hosts failing with ""There is no row at position 0."" and ""Unable to start proxy scan"" due to a failed certificate exchange. 

**Desired Outcome**
Successful scans for all FSAA hosts

**Steps to Reproduce**
Run the FSAA/Permissions group for the erroring servers from the Schedule 

**Troubleshooting Completed/Notes**
- Removed certs from LocalSystem using PSExec on Proxy server
- Removed certs from NEA service account on NEA console server
- Currently running the following:
--- NEA v11.6.0.65
--- FSAA Proxy v11.6.0.16 (local system)
------ Advised to upgrade
--- SDD v11.6.0.9
------ Advised to upgrade
- Some hosts are successful

@Salesforce It looks like according to the job log that they are attempting to use automatic certificate exchange. However, a domain trust is required in order to use that option, and according to the error being thrown it looks like that is missing.

If no domian trust is present, then manual certificate exchange must be used. Steps to setup manual exchange are documented here:

@Salesforce 

The secure stream errors from the AppletServer logs are normal and expected because the proxy is running as LocalSystem.

The job is attempting to use credentials in the connection profile, failing, and falling back to LocalSystem and succeeding.
This can be seen in the job logs.

In the 8/13 job logs, there are errors ""Unable to start scan ..."" which have details above them - when starting the scan for 3 hosts, the https handshake took too long, so the scan failed for these hosts. This is probably due to the network conditions at the time because these do not recur in the 9/19 job logs.

For the remaining 119 hosts, there are fatal errors reading the T2s.
Can we get the T2s from the proxy for the host ""HUGVAPPLRSMS001"" so we can see why this is happening?

Identified an issue affecting proxy mode scans. Working on a fix.


The 8/2 applet log provided has this error message ""Failed to connect to \HUGVAPPLRSMS001IPC$: The specified network name is no longer available""
Was able to reproduce by disabling the ""Server"" service. This service should be running on target hosts in order for scans to succeed.
This appears to have lead to the current issue reading the proxies T2s that we will get a fix for

@Salesforce @Helen Randall - Hey Tay, 

The ""Unable to
Establish a Secure Stream"" error is normal and expected because the proxy
is running as LocalSystem. The job is attempting to use credentials in the
connection profile, failing, and falling back to LocalSystem and succeeding.

 

However, when dev
investigated the logs they found an """"Failed to connect to \HUGVAPPLRSMS001IPC$: The specified
network name is no longer available"". To connect to the IPC$ share on the
target host the ""Server"" service has to be running, dev reproduced
that error by turning off that service, but there could be other
misconfigurations that lead to ""The specified network name is no longer
available"".

 

When that error was
encountered it left the T2s in a bad state, so on the next scan the remote T2
check failed. The remote T2 check was fixed with HF 11.6.0.057 so that should
no longer fail on the next scan after applying the HF. However, if the """"Failed
to connect to \HUGVAPPLRSMS001IPC$:
The specified network name is no longer available"" error re-occurs then
that would suggest an environmental issue and you should confirm that the
""Server"" service is running on the target host, and troubleshoot
connectivity to that IPC$ share.
