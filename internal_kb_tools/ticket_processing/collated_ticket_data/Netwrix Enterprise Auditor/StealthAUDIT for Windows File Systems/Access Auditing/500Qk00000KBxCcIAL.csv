1) I can help provide the answers to the questions that you asked on Jan 3rd if I know which version of Linux you have installed on your endpoints:

+++++
How do I verify if a Linux host is running NFSv3 or older?
Do all Unix hosts have firewalls?
How do I set the no_root_squash flag on an export policy?
+++++

The specific answers to the 3 question above are not necessarily universal and they are Linux OS dependent.

This is why I responded with: ""Which version(s) of Linux are you running?"" on Jan 3rd.
Please let me know if you responded to this question and I missed the response.

Which version(s) of Linux are you running on your endpoints?

2) Do you have Linux Admin in your organization or individual responsible for setting up your Linux servers?
They should know the answer to which Linux version you are running and should also be able to answer your 3 questions as well.
