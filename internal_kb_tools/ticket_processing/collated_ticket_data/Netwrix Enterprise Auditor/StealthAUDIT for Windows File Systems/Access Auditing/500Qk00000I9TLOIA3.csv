"500Qk00000I9TLOIA3","00426647","Support Ticket","3 FSAA scans are reporting status ""Running"" with zero duration","Post 11.6 upgrade (ticket 00421116)
multiple FSAA scans are in ""running"" status, but don't seem to have ever started to scan.
It was 6 servers, but we cleared the running.lck file from the job's folder and restarted the job

Now only 3 servers seem stuck in running status","running FSAA jobs","The servers that are hung in ""running"" status are:
AM-PBRFS-S121
ML-PI3RCRD-S121
SHQFL001

---------------
investigating the bulk imports, it seems like the servers are actually finishing and uploading
this might just be a UI issue

We ran a test on ML-P13RCRD-S121
-it seems to be working

client will kick off the FSAA scan again when the current SEEK scan finishes
27 days and counting
-this is expected","wait for SEEK scan to finish then kick off FSAA scan again
client will let us know when SEEK finishes","initial issue seemed to have been caused by scheduling conflicts with overlapping jobs

Cleared the Running.lck files for the scans stuck in running status
some still report no run time, but are running, finishing, and bulk importing

seems to be just a UI issue

The ticket age is mostly due to how long each test scan takes
