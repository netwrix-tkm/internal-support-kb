"500Qk00000HjQr6IAF","00425730","Support Ticket","Bulk import is throwing error","A single Bulk import job is returning these error message:
""SQL logic error unknown database strucmap""","run the bulk import job","Issues identified:
The latest bulk import didn't even try to start
-It looks like this is because the FSAA system scan failed to complete. 

Most recent FSAA System Scan failed after only a couple hours
-previous scans took a couple days
-scan time has been increasing as depth has increased, as expected
-currently set to 8 levels deep
Errors identified:
Bulk import error:
""Host is offline""
-This is expected for a server that appears to have been decommissioned.

Error in Application log on Netwrix Server:
.NET runtime ""unhandled exception"" error with StealthAUDIT.exe
-This appears to be what killed the most recent scan

FSAA System Scan job error:
""Error 110 parsing tags the system cannot open the device or files specified"" - Path to file
-This is a common error when scanning related to file access at the time of the scan
Changes made:
Bulk import:
-disabled skipping over hosts that don't respond to ping
-enabled uploading partial scans
--This way, the bulk import should run even if the FSAA System Scan fails to fully complete

This is unrelated to the FSAA scan issues, but we did make a change in Netwrix Activity Monitor.
-Changed the monitored Hosts to report their host name as FQND
-This is important for when you enable FSAC (File Activity) auditing","waiting to hear back from the client

request logs from job after setting to debug","Ran bulk import repair on the host having the problem.

FSAA Bulk import job > Configure > Query > Query properties > Configure > Maintenance > Repair
