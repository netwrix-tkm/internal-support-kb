@Salesforce During the preliminary investigation we need to do more digging to find the issue's root. It would help us if we have T2s from the customer's environment, would it be possible for them to provide those for us?

@Chris Brooks @Ethan Israel @Salesforce 
Log file 2-FSAA Bulk Import_Log_20241113_005300.tsv shows the UNIQUE constraint error. However, the subsequent bulk import log 2-FSAA Bulk Import_Log_20241113_203200.tsv shows that data was reset and successfully imported. So not sure if that is still an issue.

The latest bulk import job log shows a database is locked error: 

16/11/2024 00:01:59 ERROR FILESYSTEMACCESS Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute ""code = Busy (5), message = System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteException (0x800007AF): database is locked  database is locked     at System.Data.SQLite.SQLite3.Step(SQLiteStatement stmt)     at System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteDataReader.NextResult()     at System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteDataReader..ctor(SQLiteCommand cmd, CommandBehavior behave)     at System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteCommand.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior behavior)     at System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteCommand.ExecuteNonQuery(CommandBehavior behavior)     at System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteCommand.ExecuteNonQuery()     at System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteTransaction.Begin(Boolean deferredLock)     at System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteTransactionBase..ctor(SQLiteConnection connection, Boolean deferredLock)     at System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteTransaction..ctor(SQLiteConnection connection, Boolean deferredLock)     at System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection.BeginDbTransaction(IsolationLevel isolationLevel)     at System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteConnection.BeginTransaction()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Tier2.MigrateDbs(SQLiteConnection sqLite, DatabaseFiles tables, String host)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Tier2.IsTier2SchemaUpdated(SQLiteConnection sqLite, DatabaseFiles tables, String host)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.BulkImportTask.InternalProcessRecord()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()"" BRPW-FS01 DCExtract 8628 7416 9784

Database is locked error usually means that we are attempting to use the tier 2 database while it's already being used by another process. This can occur when attempting to bulk import a database while a scan is occurring, or 2 scans of the same type overlapping at the same time. These kinds of scenarios can also causing some data to be written incorrectly, which could lead to the original Unique constraint issue.

I think the next steps is for customer to review their job schedules and make sure that there are no overlaps of scheduled scans and imports. NEA does NOT support any bulk import of a host that is being actively scanned. We also don't support scanning the same host of the same scan type at the same time. (2 permissions scans running against the same host at the same time).
