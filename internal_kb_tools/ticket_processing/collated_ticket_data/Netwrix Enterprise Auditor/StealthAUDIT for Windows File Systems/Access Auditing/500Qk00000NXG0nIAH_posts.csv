We would like to delete FSAA data for a number of hosts in bulk. How can we safely accomplish this?

Thanks,

Since they don't have FSAC data, should be able to drop the desired host according to KB for decommissioned FS hosts

client want to keep SDD scan data for those hosts, so I don't think the decommissioned host plan will work. That should delete everything","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2025-04-03T13:12:10.000Z"

The client's use case is related to ticket 00412142
they are using a custom script to omit workstations from broken inheritance scans
they don't like using custom scripts but I don't think there is another option

They want to setup FSAC
this will require it's own ticket","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2025-04-04T13:51:09.000Z"
