Thank you for meeting with us today. We adjusted the number of Probable Owners scanned by the FSAA from unlimited to 4. That should speed up the scan some, but upgrading and using proxies will lead to a large performance boost.

We'll continue the upgrade on Ticket #413178.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,
