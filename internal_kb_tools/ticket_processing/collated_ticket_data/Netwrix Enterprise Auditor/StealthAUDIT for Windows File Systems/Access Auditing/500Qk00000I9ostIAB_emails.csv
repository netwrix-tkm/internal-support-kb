Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we reviewed the permission scan and discovered that the scan did not complete gracefully.
We noticed some error messages related to the database being locked.
When we checked the schedule, it showed the permission scan was scheduled to run simultaneously with the ADI scan.
We changed the schedule and manually the permission scan.
You can reply to this email to provide an update.

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:

	Found the below error on both FSAA System Scan and Bulk Import:
	
		code = Constraint (19), message = System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteException (0x800027AF): constraint failed
		UNIQUE constraint failed: TBL_FSAA_ResourceMap.AccessID
		  at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground[TResult](Action statusAction, Func`1 execAction)
		  at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.Util.RunInBackground(Action statusAction, Action execAction)
		  at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA.BulkImportTask.InternalProcessRecord()
		  at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task.StartExecute()
		Corrected the above error by running the ""Reset Hosts"" option from FSAA > Query Settings > Maintenance > Reset Hosts
	
	
	Saw the Shares and ACLs repopulated in the AIC
	Added the StealthBITS service account to the Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access group
	
		This corrected users not being able to login and view Published Reports (Ticket #00426441) and incorrect properties count in the AD Summary report
	
	
	Began configuring the FileSystem > Ad Hoc Audits > FS_ShareAudit to output a report of ACLs per share
	
		
	
	


I'm going to go ahead and close out this ticket (#0042667) since we are able to see the ACLs in the AIC and via the new FS_ShareAudit report. I'm also going to close out ticket #00426441 | Cannot access Reporting since we resolved that issue as well. Ticket #00417261 will remain open while we continue to troubleshoot and investigate the issue with Admin users not being able to log into the AIC.

Thank you.

Looking further into the ACL issue where we're seeing your FSAA System Bulk Import fail- is this being run when any other File System scan or import is being run against that host? I'd like to schedule another remote session to take a look at how things are running and confirm another scan isn't locking some of the files on us, please use the link below to schedule our next remote troubleshooting session:
