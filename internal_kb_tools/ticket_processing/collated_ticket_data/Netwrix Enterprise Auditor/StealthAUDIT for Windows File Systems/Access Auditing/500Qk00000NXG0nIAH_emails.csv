Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help. Please help me better understand your question and use case. It sounds like you want to delete all the FSAA (permissions) data from NEA's database for some, but not all, FS hosts. Do you also want to delete the FSAC (activity) data from those hosts, as well? Removing FSAA data, but preserving FSAC data, for a selection of hosts gets tricky.  Removing all the data for a selection of FS hosts is much easier.

Hi Joshua,

Thanks for the reply. Currently, the FSAC data is not being collected, so
we only have the FSAA to worry about. However, it looks like FSAC is
something we may be interested in running, do you know if it is included
with the File System Solution license, or we need a separate license
for that?

Thanks,
Iurii

Since you don't have any FSAC data to preserve, dropping the old FS hosts is pretty straight forward. I'm not sure of your use case, but it sounds like this KB will help: How to Drop Data for Decommissioned File Servers.

As for FSAC auditing, I believe your current license includes it. To be sure, please send me a screen shot of the license information in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor: NEA Console > Help > About. Do you already have Netwrix Activity Monitor installed on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server? Since you aren't collecting any activity data currently, then you probably don't, but I'm curious.

I can help with this over a remote session, if you'd like. I can also help configure FSAC auditing for you, but it will need its own ticket, so it should wait until after you remove the old FS hosts. Let me know how you would like to proceed.

Hi Joshua,

Thanks for the documentation! It looks like this applies to decommissioned
hosts. However, the hosts (workstations) we want to clear FSAA data for are
still active—we do want to continue running SEEK scans on them, but without
FSAA or FSAC. Given that, would the method outlined in the KB allow us to
keep running SEEK scans after clearing FSAA data?

Also, you're absolutely right—we don’t have the Netwrix Activity Monitor
installed. If possible, we’d definitely like to set it up along with the
FSAC scans for the file shares. Naturally we can work on that after we've
cleared the unneeded FSAA data for the workstations.

Here is the screenshot of our Licensing:

Iurii

You are correct. If you want to keep the SDD data, we will probably need to run custom SQL scripts. Could you help me better understand your use case? There might be another way to accomplish what you want. Why do you want to delete the FSAA data and only the FSAA data?

It's important to note that the Access Information Center uses the FSAA scan data as the scaffolding for all File Server resource data. So, if the FSAA data for a server is missing, then no other data for that File Server will be visible for that file server either.

Hello Joshua,

Got it, so it sounds like a lot of components actually depend on the FSAA
data being available. We have had issues with analyzing Broken Inheritance
and data for our workstations, the main issue being that the Broken
Inheritance analysis task would run endlessly, filing up the tempdb in the
process. The workaround was to modify the SQL Query for Broken Inheritance
and limit it to only run against our file server, and skip processing all
the FSAA data from around 300 workstations. You can find more details can
be found in ticket 00412142.

Naturally, we wanted to avoid having custom SQL queries in our
configurations, hence the idea to stop scanning FSAA on workstations and
delete any currently existing data. However, it does seem like this is not
the option, and we may need to continue having the custom SQL query.

Do you have information on the FSAC? Based on the licenses we currently
have are we entitled to run it?

Thanks,
Iurii

I believe your license does include File System Activity. We can help set this up for you over a remote session. It will require installing Netwrix Activity Monitor, deploying its agents to the File Servers, configuring a monitoring plan in Netwrix Activity Monitor to collect the desired data, and then configuring the scan job in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to collect that data. It will also need its own support ticket.

I can create the new ticket for you; however, I am out-of-office all next week. If you don't mind waiting until the following week to get everything installed and configured, I will have the ticket assigned to me. If you'd rather get started as soon as possible, I will have the ticket assigned to an available engineer.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Hello Joshua,
 

Got it, so it sounds like a lot of components actually depend on the FSAA data being available. We have had issues with analyzing Broken Inheritance and data for our workstations, the main issue being that the Broken Inheritance analysis task would run endlessly, filing up the tempdb in the process. The workaround was to modify the SQL Query for Broken Inheritance and limit it to only run against our file server and skip processing all the FSAA data from around 300 workstations. You can find more details can be found in ticket 00412142. 
 

Naturally, we wanted to avoid having custom SQL queries in our configurations, hence the idea to stop scanning FSAA on workstations and delete any currently existing data. However, it does seem like this is not the option, and we may need to continue having the custom SQL query.

 

Do you have information on the FSAC? Based on the licenses we currently have are we entitled to run it?

 

Thanks,

Iurii

Hello Columbia University,

You are correct. If you want to keep the SDD data, we will probably need to run custom SQL scripts. Could you help me better understand your use case? There might be another way to accomplish what you want. Why do you want to delete the FSAA data and only the FSAA data?

It's important to note that the Access Information Center uses the FSAA scan data as the scaffolding for all File Server resource data. So, if the FSAA data for a server is missing, then no other data for that File Server will be visible for that file server either.

Thank you,

Hi Joshua,
 

Thanks for the documentation! It looks like this applies to decommissioned hosts. However, the hosts (workstations) we want to clear FSAA data for are still active—we do want to continue running SEEK scans on them, but without FSAA or FSAC. Given that, would the method outlined in the KB allow us to keep running SEEK scans after clearing FSAA data?

 

Also, you're absolutely right—we don’t have the Netwrix Activity Monitor installed. If possible, we’d definitely like to set it up along with the FSAC scans for the file shares. Naturally we can work on that after we've cleared the unneeded FSAA data for the workstations.

 

Here is the screenshot of our Licensing:

 

Best regards,

Iurii

Hello Columbia University,

Since you don't have any FSAC data to preserve, dropping the old FS hosts is pretty straight forward. I'm not sure of your use case, but it sounds like this KB will help: How to Drop Data for Decommissioned File Servers.

As for FSAC auditing, I believe your current license includes it. To be sure, please send me a screen shot of the license information in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor: NEA Console > Help > About. Do you already have Netwrix Activity Monitor installed on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server? Since you aren't collecting any activity data currently, then you probably don't, but I'm curious.

I can help with this over a remote session, if you'd like. I can also help configure FSAC auditing for you, but it will need its own ticket, so it should wait until after you remove the old FS hosts. Let me know how you would like to proceed.

Thank you,

Hi Joshua,
 

Thanks for the reply. Currently, the FSAC data is not being collected, so we only have the FSAA to worry about. However, it looks like FSAC is something we may be interested in running, do you know if it is included with the File System Solution license, or we need a separate license for that?

Hi Joshua,

No worries, due to other projects, I am going to have to postpone the
implementation of File System Activity scanning on my end as well. So we
can probably close this ticket and I will open a new ticket whenever we
have the throughput.

However, given that the implementation requires an agent install on the
File Server, are NetApp ONTAP supported?

Thanks,
Iurii

NetApp is supported but collections work differently than Windows File Servers. For NAS devices, the agent is installed on a proxy server. For NetApp, we configure an FPolicy on the NetApp side that collects the event data and sends it to the proxy server. Netwrix Activity Monitor's agent on the proxy receives, parses, and logs the event data. Netwrix Enterprise Auditor can then collect the data straight from the proxy server's logs or from a network archive. Theres a decent amount of flexibility in the deployment. Depending on the volume of activity and the specs of the application server, you can install the agent directly on the application server and forgo the proxy, although this is not recommended.

I'll close this ticket for now. Whenever you are ready to work on getting FSAC auditing up and running just open a new ticket. In the meantime, here are some Help Center articles for reference:

Requirements:
NetApp Data ONTAP 7-Mode Activity Auditing Configuration
NetApp Data ONTAP Cluster-Mode Activity Auditing Configuration

Administration
NetApp in Netwrix Activity Monitor

Hi Joshua,
 

No worries, due to other projects, I am going to have to postpone the implementation of File System Activity scanning on my end as well. So we can probably close this ticket and I will open a new ticket whenever we have the throughput.

 

However, given that the implementation requires an agent install on the File Server, are NetApp ONTAP supported?

 

Thanks, 

Iurii

Hello Columbia University,

I believe your license does include File System Activity. We can help set this up for you over a remote session. It will require installing Netwrix Activity Monitor, deploying its agents to the File Servers, configuring a monitoring plan in Netwrix Activity Monitor to collect the desired data, and then configuring the scan job in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to collect that data. It will also need its own support ticket.

I can create the new ticket for you; however, I am out-of-office all next week. If you don't mind waiting until the following week to get everything installed and configured, I will have the ticket assigned to me. If you'd rather get started as soon as possible, I will have the ticket assigned to an available engineer.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Thank you,

Hello Joshua,
 

Got it, so it sounds like a lot of components actually depend on the FSAA data being available. We have had issues with analyzing Broken Inheritance and data for our workstations, the main issue being that the Broken Inheritance analysis task would run endlessly, filing up the tempdb in the process. The workaround was to modify the SQL Query for Broken Inheritance and limit it to only run against our file server and skip processing all the FSAA data from around 300 workstations. You can find more details can be found in ticket 00412142. 
 

Naturally, we wanted to avoid having custom SQL queries in our configurations, hence the idea to stop scanning FSAA on workstations and delete any currently existing data. However, it does seem like this is not the option, and we may need to continue having the custom SQL query.

 

Do you have information on the FSAC? Based on the licenses we currently have are we entitled to run it?

 

Thanks,

Iurii

Hello Columbia University,

You are correct. If you want to keep the SDD data, we will probably need to run custom SQL scripts. Could you help me better understand your use case? There might be another way to accomplish what you want. Why do you want to delete the FSAA data and only the FSAA data?

It's important to note that the Access Information Center uses the FSAA scan data as the scaffolding for all File Server resource data. So, if the FSAA data for a server is missing, then no other data for that File Server will be visible for that file server either.

Thank you,

Hi Joshua,
 

Thanks for the documentation! It looks like this applies to decommissioned hosts. However, the hosts (workstations) we want to clear FSAA data for are still active—we do want to continue running SEEK scans on them, but without FSAA or FSAC. Given that, would the method outlined in the KB allow us to keep running SEEK scans after clearing FSAA data?

 

Also, you're absolutely right—we don’t have the Netwrix Activity Monitor installed. If possible, we’d definitely like to set it up along with the FSAC scans for the file shares. Naturally we can work on that after we've cleared the unneeded FSAA data for the workstations.

 

Here is the screenshot of our Licensing:

 

Best regards,

Iurii

Hello Columbia University,

Since you don't have any FSAC data to preserve, dropping the old FS hosts is pretty straight forward. I'm not sure of your use case, but it sounds like this KB will help: How to Drop Data for Decommissioned File Servers.

As for FSAC auditing, I believe your current license includes it. To be sure, please send me a screen shot of the license information in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor: NEA Console > Help > About. Do you already have Netwrix Activity Monitor installed on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server? Since you aren't collecting any activity data currently, then you probably don't, but I'm curious.

I can help with this over a remote session, if you'd like. I can also help configure FSAC auditing for you, but it will need its own ticket, so it should wait until after you remove the old FS hosts. Let me know how you would like to proceed.

Hi Joshua,
 

Thanks for the reply. Currently, the FSAC data is not being collected, so we only have the FSAA to worry about. However, it looks like FSAC is something we may be interested in running, do you know if it is included with the File System Solution license, or we need a separate license for that?
