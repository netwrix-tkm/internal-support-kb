@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer

In regards to Repro Step 1: Were the Tier2 SQLite DBs dropped in addition to Tier1 SQL data? This would have to be done for all the hosts in your DFS HOST LIST which appears to be: 

	 - 	TCALIGUIRI-DC02.SANDBOX.TCALIGUIRI.LOCAL

	 - 	TCALIGUIRI-FS.TCALIGUIRI.LOCAL



The 12.0 job log is not set to debug level so it's useless.

It may be helpful to see how the 11.6 and 12.0 AIC are configured in Home > Configuration > Database,
and make sure the storage profiles used for the respective 11.6/12.0 jobs match.
According to the job xmls, these should be the databases in the profiles ""Audit"" for 11.6 and ""NewProfile1"" for 12.0.

11.6 FSAA.png has a TCALIGUIRI-FS host folder. This host's data not dropped? I think that is causing issues
