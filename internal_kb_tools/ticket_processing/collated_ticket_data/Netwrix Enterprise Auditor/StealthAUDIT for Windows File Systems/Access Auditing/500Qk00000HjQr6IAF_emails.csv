Hello Kellen,

Here is the new ticket for the SQL bulk import error.

Please check if the StructMap.dbaa3 file exists in the associated directory:
%sainstalldir%FSAA<hostname>

Please also run the bulk import repair for that host.

It does look like a different bulk import job has stopped running.  I think the FSAA System scan is timing out or having an error similar to the parsing error we had before.

	Check the ""Running Instances"" in NEA and make sure the job isn't currently running
	Check ""Schedules"" to make sure the job isn't about to start 
	Select the job and click ""Open Folder""
	Look for any running.lck files

Thank you for meeting with Nick and me yesterday. In our session we investigated the issues you were experiencing with your FSAA scan and bulk import. We only made a couple small changes and are now just waiting to see how the next scan goes. Here's a quick summary of what we found, and the troubleshooting performed.
Issues identified:
The latest bulk import didn't even try to start
-It looks like this is because the FSAA system scan failed to complete. 

Most recent FSAA System Scan failed after only a couple hours
-previous scans took a couple days
-scan time has been increasing as depth has increased, as expected
-currently set to 8 levels deep
Errors identified:
Bulk import error:
""Host is offline""
-This is expected for a server that appears to have been decommissioned.

Error in Application log on Netwrix Server:
.NET runtime ""unhandled exception"" error with StealthAUDIT.exe
-This appears to be what killed the most recent scan

FSAA System Scan job error:
""Error 110 parsing tags the system cannot open the device or files specified"" - Path to file
-This is a common error when scanning related to file access at the time of the scan
Changes made:
Bulk import:
-disabled skipping over hosts that don't respond to ping
-enabled uploading partial scans
--This way, the bulk import should run even if the FSAA System Scan fails to fully complete

This is unrelated to the FSAA scan issues, but we did make a change in Netwrix Activity Monitor.
-Changed the monitored Hosts to report their host name as FQND
-This is important for when you enable FSAC (File Activity) auditing
Next step:
We are waiting to see if how the next scan completes.
You may want to remove the decommissioned server from the associated host list.

Please let me know if you have any errors with either the FSAA System Scan or the subsequent Bulk Import.

Thank you,

Thank you for the update, and I'm glad to hear it's working as expected now.

As for scheduling best practices, every job relies on data from AD Inventory so that generally gets ran once a day, early in the morning.
Beyond that, it depends on your environments and reporting needs.

I'll close this ticket, but if you have any questions, just reply to this email within the next 30 days, and it will reopen.

Everything has cleared up.  Looks like a back-up job as mentioned was the problem.

We are good to close out.

 

 

Do you have any best practice recommendations in terms of scheduling?

 

 

Thank you,
