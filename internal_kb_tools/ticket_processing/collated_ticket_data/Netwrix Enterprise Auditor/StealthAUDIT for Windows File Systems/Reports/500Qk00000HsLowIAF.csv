When running the FileSystemOverview job, the report generation fails with error ""Sequence contains more than one matching element""

Cause
Duplicate entries in the job and the report.xml lead to the report failing to populate because it could not determine which field was the correct one.

Resolution
We removed the entries in between <Reports> in the report.xml file for the job.
Once this was removed the report ran properly.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Ian Ranstrom","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Reports","","","0.0","Closed - Resolved","Polsinelli","Brandon Artist","2024-11-04T20:45:08.000Z","2024-11-04T21:21:50.000Z"
