"500Qk00000DasC6IAJ","00416236","Support Ticket","FSAA Scan not picking up updated permission changes","On one of my hosts, there is a folder that has broken inheritance with both direct and inherited permissions.

We have remediated the broken inheritance on the folder and confirmed directly that it's fixed. 

After running a full fsaa scan against the same host 3 times, AIC still shows both direct and inherited permissions.

When looking at SA_FSAA_Resources against the folder in question, 
accesslastseen is up to date.","","","","Requested:
Any Issues noted under the FSAC job that is collecting the File System in question.
Are we using a FSAA Proxy to pull the data?

Are there any Errors in the NAM console for the host in question?
Which Operations are enabled?

Where was the Permissions change made on the Share or NTFS level?      I'm assuming NTFS based on the Description.

Do we see the Events in question in the NAM console?

Contact noted:
Looks like resetting the host under FSAA query > configure > maintenance, and then bulk import might have resolved it.
