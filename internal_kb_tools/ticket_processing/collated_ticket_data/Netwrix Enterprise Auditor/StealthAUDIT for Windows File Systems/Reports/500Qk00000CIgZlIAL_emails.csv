Thank you. I was able to get past the error and got the report, but the report is blank, saying there are no stale files, which I know that is not correct.

I'm guessing I have some setting misconfigured. Below are my current settings for the FS_CleanupAssessment job. Can you tell if anything needs to be changed or know why I'm not seeing any stale files in the reports?

Number of days after which a resource's LastModified timestamp classifies it as stale - Set to 365
If 1, LastModified will be used to calculate staleness. If 0, LastAccessed will be used - Set to 1
UNC Paths of folders to exclude from staleness consideration (recursive) - None
Lower bound for files to be included in the FileDetails table (by LastModified, in days) - Set to 365
Upper bound for files to be included in the FileDetails table (by LastModified, in days) - Set to 7300

Hello Brandon, thanks for the update!

Please, check that .Active Directory Inventory job group and FileSystem - 0.Collection - 1-FSAA System Scans and 2-FSAA Bulk Import were executed.

In the ticket description you mentioned ""Shares with Stale Content"" - could you please share with us the number of stale files from there?

I will forward this ticket to an engineer in your time zone.

Thank you!

Thank you. I was able to get past the error and got the report, but the report is blank, saying there are no stale files, which I know that is not correct.

I'm guessing I have some setting misconfigured. Below are my current settings for the FS_CleanupAssessment job. Can you tell if anything needs to be changed or know why I'm not seeing any stale files in the reports?

Number of days after which a resource's LastModified timestamp classifies it as stale - Set to 365
If 1, LastModified will be used to calculate staleness. If 0, LastAccessed will be used - Set to 1
UNC Paths of folders to exclude from staleness consideration (recursive) - None
Lower bound for files to be included in the FileDetails table (by LastModified, in days) - Set to 365
Upper bound for files to be included in the FileDetails table (by LastModified, in days) - Set to 7300

Hello Brandon, thanks for your question!

Please, try the following:
Since the SQL analysis works outside of NEA - there is a .csv file located in a job folder. You will find ""Value"" inside this file. Please, remove ""Value"" from the .csv file (in my case I have a blank .csv file after ""Value"" removal). Save .csv file and run the job one more time.

Hello Brandon, thanks for your question!

Please, try the following:
Since the SQL analysis works outside of NEA - there is a .csv file located in a job folder. You will find ""Value"" inside this file. Please, remove ""Value"" from the .csv file (in my case I have a blank .csv file after ""Value"" removal). Save .csv file and run the job one more time.

Thank you!

I'm getting the following error on my FS_CleanupAssessment job.

""Invalid length parameter passed to the LEFT or SUBSTRING function. The statement has been terminated.""
[cid:image006.png@01DAD2B3.70D8DB50]

Is this something you can help me with resolving? Or should I open a separate support ticket for this?

You can close this case. I was able to resolve my issue by re-running all FileSystem jobs. I am able to pull up my list of stale files now. Thanks

Hello Brandon, thanks for the update! 

Please, check that .Active Directory Inventory job group and FileSystem - 0.Collection - 1-FSAA System Scans and 2-FSAA Bulk Import were executed. 

In the ticket description you mentioned ""Shares with Stale Content"" - could you please share with us the number of stale files from there?

I will forward this ticket to an engineer in your time zone.

Thank you!

Thank you. I was able to get past the error and got the report, but the report is blank, saying there are no stale files, which I know that is not correct. 



 



I'm guessing I have some setting misconfigured. Below are my current settings for the FS_CleanupAssessment job. Can you tell if anything needs to be changed or know why I'm not seeing any stale files in the reports? 



 



Number of days after which a resource's LastModified timestamp classifies it as stale - Set to 365



If 1, LastModified will be used to calculate staleness. If 0, LastAccessed will be used - Set to 1



UNC Paths of folders to exclude from staleness consideration (recursive) - None



Lower bound for files to be included in the FileDetails table (by LastModified, in days) - Set to 365



Upper bound for files to be included in the FileDetails table (by LastModified, in days) - Set to 7300
