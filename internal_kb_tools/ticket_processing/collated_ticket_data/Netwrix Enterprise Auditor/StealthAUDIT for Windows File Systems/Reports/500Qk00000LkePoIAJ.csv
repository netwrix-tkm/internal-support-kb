"500Qk00000LkePoIAJ","00435443","Support Ticket","Removal of old file servers in reports and AIC activity missing","We're seeing old file servers in reports such as the stale content report, skewing the amount of stale data in our environment.  We are also missing activity data in AIC in regards to file servers.","","+++++
2024_0213: Meeting with Brandon Artist
+++++
1) I walked through the steps found in this Netwrix Help Center article with Brandon and the job is now deleting the data for the 17 servers that he designated:

How to Drop Data for Decommissioned File Servers

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000001qvpKAA.html

2) AIC 11.6.0.12 - Is currently not rendering Activity Details.
I did not check if Activity Statistics is showing anything.
2 sets of logs are attached but I am not sure if they are useful.","+++++
2025_0218: Review the Zoom Meeting - lots of specific details covered and actions performed.
+++++
1) Jobs will run over the weekend and Brandon will see if the inactive servers' stale data is removed.
2) Create a new case for the AIC issue.","+++++
2025_0218: Meeting summary
+++++

1) Unknown protocol: VSS - Volume Shadow Copy Service
We pick up the activity but we do not do anything with that activity.

+++++
NAM > Monitored Hosts > File: C:Program FilesStealthbitsStealthAudit > Edit output > Operations tab > VSS Operations > un-check all 3 at the top
+++++

+++++
Snapshot add
Snapshot delete - may be checkedselected by default
Read
+++++
CTRL-A to select all 41 at once time

""Saving 0/28"" - next to OK BTN - 28 INI files to update but then it will roll pretty quick
+++++

2) DC2-P-FILE-02 - had no file output - no PATH to ""DC2-P-FILE-02_Log.tsv""
""C:Program FilesStealthbitsStealthAUDITFSAcSBTFileMon_LogsDC2-P-FILE-02_Log_.tsv""
(click the 3 dots to navigate and click the ""Test"" BUTTON) 

3) In NAM, we checked the 'Account Exclusions' TAB:
+++++
NT AUTHORITYIUSR
NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM
NT AUTHORITYLOCAL SERVICE
NT AUTHORITYNETWORK SERVICE
+++++

4) Checked both NEA Jobs - 
1-FSAA System Scans - hit a timeout of some sort
2-FSAA Bulk Import - just one host had a problem

5) NEA AIC > Resource Audit > \DC2-P-FILE-02Scanner > Activity Details > Date range: 02/11/2025 - 02/18/2025

Date range: 12/30/2025 - 01/07/2025
NEA > 2.Activity > 1-FSAC System Scans > Results > Activity - find a server that has a lot of activity events
+++++
In AIC > DCP-APPS-02 > Activity Details and Activity Statistics - there is lots of data
column hidden = called ""Target Path"" - for moves this is how you know where the data/file went
+++++

+++++
Retention value in the NEA console itself
+++++
NEA > 2.Activity > 1-FSAC System Scans > Configure > Queries > Query Properties > Configure BUTTON > 
Activity Settings > ""Set scan filter for detailed activity"" > 60 days

6) In NAM > 'Monitored Hosts' tab > 'DC2-P-FILE-02.polsinelli.law' > 'Additional Properties' TAB > 'Report hostname as' = ${NETBIOS_NAME}

Is there a variable for this?
like ${NETBIOS_NAME}

Right-click on the actual host > Windows tab > 'Report the host name as:' NETBIOS name OR FQDN

7) SI Agent Installer registers NETBIOS name as the Machine name (in the UI and DB)
Separate Files:
NEA uses = ""C:Program FilesSTEATLHbitsSteatlhAUDITFSACSBTFileMon_Logs<NETBIOS_NAME>_Log_.tsv"" = NEA uses
NAM uses = ""C:ProgramDatgaNetwrixActivity MonitorAgentSBTFileMon_LogsSBTFileMon_Log_.tsv"" = NAM uses
(same data but in different format)
NAM versus SI team

8) NEA > GROUP_2.Activity > ""1-FSAC Systems Scans""
""DC2-P-FILE-02"" - did not have 'Report hostname as' set up correctly.

2.Activity > ""Run Group""

""Remove old hosts"" JOB > Results > DEFAULT > Right-click on the HOST column and ""Group By"" to see concise list of 17 hosts (or whatever the ""SA_FSAA_Hosts"" table contains)

9) NEA > ""Host Management"" > FILESERVERS - ensure that the 17 servers have been removed from this list

10) 1-SEEK System Scans > MESSAGE = ""Failed to delete...FSAA<SERVERNAME>SDDTemp - not crtical as this is a TEMP DIR that NEA uses.
You can manually empty that directory if you want.

11) ""DC2-P-FILE-02"" - is it running an old leftover applet?
""DC2-P-FILE-02"" - a lot of files are collected but then it errors.

FSAA DC Wizard > Query Selection > Maintenance > ""Remove scan executable and data"" - Remove FSAA applet and data from remote server(s).
+++++
Created a new ""Remove_Applet_FSAA"" job (in the Custom_Job_Folder) > Configure > Queries > Data Collector drop-down = FILESYSTEMACCESS >
Query Selection > Maintenance > ""Remove scan executable and data"" - Remove FSAA applet and data from remote server(s).

Hosts > Host name - added ""DC2-P-FILE-02""
+++++

12) ""2-FSAAC Bulk Import"" - is now succeeding and took about 8 minutes 47 seconds for the successful run

13) 'Remove old hosts' job MESSAGES:
+++++
Host is offline
Abort request received
Host processing aborted
+++++

14) AIC > <SERVER_NAME> > Activity Details
Drill into specific folders and AIC is displaying data after all of the NEA fixes that we applied

15) FS_StaleContent > re-run this report job after the 'Remove old hosts' job completes successfully

16) ""Remove old hosts"" JOB >  Error removing DCP-ARCHIVE-01 from tier 1 database: Failed to remove Host ID: 5 from table SA_FSAA_Resources
Renamed hostname from ""DCP-ARCHIVE-01"" to !REMOVED_DCP-ARCHIVE-01_<MORE_IDENTIFIERS>
Add ""code-renamed"" hostname to ""Remove old hosts"" JOB > Configure > Hosts list.
