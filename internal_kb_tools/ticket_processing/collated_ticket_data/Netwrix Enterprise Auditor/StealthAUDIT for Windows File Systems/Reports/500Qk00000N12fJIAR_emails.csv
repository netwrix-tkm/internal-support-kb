Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA)    11.6.0.117
NEA Access Information (AIC)         11.6.0.25 
Netwrix Activity (NAM)                    7.1.211   

We noted some related events for the path in question that was mistakenly moved into the Folder the was below its original path on the File Server.
We looked at the AIC activity reporting: Netwrix Access Information Center 11.6 > Resource Audit Overview > File System Reports > Activity Summary Report
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/ResourceAudit/FileSystem/ActivitySummary.htm

As well as in thew Netwrix Activity Monitor v7.1 > Administration > Search Feature > File Search Query
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/ActivityMonitor_7.1/page/Content/ActivityMonitor/Admin/Search/Query/File.htm

We then looked at the SQLViewCreation option to filter on the needed host and path: Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Analysis Modules > SQLViewCreation Analysis Module https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Analysis/SQLViewCreation/Overview.htm
From that we can then create a report if needed per Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Reporting > Creating a Report
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/Create.htm

Found an issue with the host Dropping packets so the Skip Hosts that do not respond to PING was disable for the FSAC scan and bulk import jobs.
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Jobs Tree > Jobs > Job Properties > Performance Tab
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/Job/Properties/Performance.htm

For this meeting, we will need to have a Full Admin access to the following
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) Server and Related SQL DB

If we could get SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) installed on the NEA host to look directly at the NEA SQL DB to help better filter the needed job.

Please join from your Workstations to avoid any UAC issues on the Server:

Rayn,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. 

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:  

What is the impact of the issue on your business? 

Who is affected by this issue? 

What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? 

Could we get clarification on ""Large amount of data Transferred from specific folders for fileshare”
Is the assumed action a copy of object off of the Server in question?

Where the files moved to another audited path/server?

What type of File Server(s) are being investigated?
***NOTE*** Windows does not have a Copy event this would just look like a multiple read event for the same object at least once to list the object then another on access however this cold be from a user truly accessing the file not necessarily copying it.

When did this issue start?  

What software is currently installed?
Could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object |  Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 
# Collects the Service install paths
(Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Service -PipelineVariable  Service |Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like 'Netwrix*'}).Pathname
(Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Service -PipelineVariable  Service |Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like 'Stealth*'}).Pathname 

We can look at SQLViewCreation pointing to the SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView as long as the host in question is being monitored by Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) & Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM)
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Analysis Modules > SQLViewCreation Analysis Module
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Analysis/SQLViewCreation/Overview.htm

Within the Analysis we can filter for known details.
