As you know I am working through a problem to fix what we call Open Shares.  An Open Share can be defined as a share that has content that is accessible to all our employees as incorrect NTFS permissions have been applied.

For example, a share or some sub-folders of a share may have permissions granted to Authenticated Users, Users, Domain Users or Everyone.

I run regular FSAA scan and FSAA Import jobs and execute the Open Access report on a regular basis and to help track our open data I have created a series of Power BI reports that connect to the StealthAudit database and specifically the SA_FS_OpenAccess_OpenResources table.

I have a report for each Isilon to make it easier to track and now I have fixed a lot of Open Shares I can see some incorrect data.

For example, even though Open Shares have been fixed on our Isilon in Adelaide and Melbourne the data we are seeing in the SA_FS_OpenAccess_OpenResources table suggests there is still open content.  However, the folders it reports do not exist.

I have run a FSAA scan, Import and Open Access report three times in recent days and the same incorrect data is showing.

What can be done to correct this problem as its skewing my reports and undermining my confidence in the product.

Regards

- Discuss and understand why they are hesitant to upgrade

- Gather more information regarding their specific scenario and why the upgrades have been challenging in the past.

- When they upgraded to version 11.6 previously, they had to roll back due to known proxy scan issues. If this is a concern affecting their hesitation to upgrade, explain the steps that have been taken to address and resolve the issue, and reassure them that these actions will help ensure a smoother upgrade this time.

- Is the scan work in their test environment or are they getting same errors

- Create a new folder in the host with open access and fun FSAA scan process to ensure it is getting picked up and once this is done, delete the folder from the host rerun the FSAA process and confirm the results.
