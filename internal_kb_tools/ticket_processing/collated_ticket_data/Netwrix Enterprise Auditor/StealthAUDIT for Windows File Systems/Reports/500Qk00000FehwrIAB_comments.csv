Customer is running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in their production environment.  they are running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed, they won't be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which they use to track their open shares.","0054u000007p5dwAAA","2024-11-01T04:00:59.000Z","2024-11-01T04:00:59.000Z","false","false"

@Chris Brooks @Ethan Israel @Michael Burrofato @Salesforce Can you provide the password to the bulk import log or upload a non password protected version of the bulk import log. It is hard to know the main issue without going through that log.

@Michael Burrofato@Salesforce@Ethan Israel@Chris Brooks Rerunning the Create Schema Job should resolve the issues found in the bulk import log. As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use since I believe that has been fixed. If this issue persists once the schema is successfully migrated we can look into that further.
