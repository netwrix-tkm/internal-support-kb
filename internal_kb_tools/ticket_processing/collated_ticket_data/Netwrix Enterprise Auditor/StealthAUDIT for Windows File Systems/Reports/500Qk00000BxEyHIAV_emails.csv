Hello, 

FS_BrokenInheritance is the job that we are having issues with, and is the one that would time out. I have increased the Timeout period from 1440 to 2880, so I have not seen it timing out since than, however it still seems to get stuck and fail in the end. 

Another issue with this job is that because it runs for such a long time our database tempdb and EnterpriseAuditor log files are growing until they fill up all the free space on the SQL server, which is around 200GB. As a result, I have limited the tempdb and EnterpriseAuditor files max growth sizes to mitigate that. However, now we are starting to see that the job gets aborted and reports that the tempdb is full.
I have tried to size these files according to the requirements set here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem.htm ; with the adjustment to the size of our environment with the number of objects that we need to scan, which should not exceed 20 million folders and files combined from our file server and workstation data.

I have uploaded DEBUG level logs for the previous two runs of the Analysis->Broken Inheritance job along with several screenshots of the messages that we are getting and the database file size configurations. Let me know if there is anything else we can provide.

What size is your tempdb for the StealthAUDIT database? Based on the images sent over, I'm seeing it at just over 12GB instead of the recommended 130GB.

Is the database also in Simple Recovery mode?

Hi Tay,

That is right, the 12GB that you have noted is only the initial size of the
tempdb data files, which we have 4 of, and each were allowed autogrow to
25GB, also there is 35GB allocated to the templog file, which in total
makes it around 135GB just for tempdb and templog files.

I have wondered whether these restrictions might be too stringent and
removed all of the restrictions for tempdb and EnterpriseAuditor data and
log files sizes. So, essentially, it had 215GB of free space that it could
use. I have then re-ran the analysis jobs this weekend, but still failed
with the following error message:
[image: image.png]

Also, for some reason the ticket has disappeared from our
ccit-cs@columbia.edu support account, so I cannot upload logs or
screenshots to this case. I am not sure how this has happened.

Best regards,
Iurii

I'll need that uploaded to the case, but I understand you don't currently see the ticket. You can try attaching the zip file via email, but I will also reach out to our Customer Portal team to look into why you're unable to see the ticket.

	Confirmed the BrokenInheritance job used to take 2h 30m, but is now taking well over 24 hours
	Verified the SQL resources look appropriate

I'll review the collected info with my team and reach out shortly with our next steps.

Has the BrokenInheritance job produced a report or anything recently? My team would like you to verify that their isn't an active issue with broken inheritance in your environment, as that would also cause the scan to run longer.

Thank you,

Hey Iurii,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

	Confirmed the BrokenInheritance job used to take 2h 30m, but is now taking well over 24 hours
	Verified the SQL resources look appropriate 
	Collected the SQL script that was taking the longest to finish

I'll review the collected info with my team and reach out shortly with our next steps.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hi Tay,

Thanks for getting back to us. We have noticed that we might have some broken inheritance issues on our workstation, which we also run Analysis jobs against. I will run the analysis job for our file shares only to see if it goes any better and will keep you posted.

Hi Tay,

Thanks so much for following up. I am currently running the analysis job just for our file shares and domain controllers, skipping all the workstations, which seem to have issues with Broken Inheritance. I should report back on the results once the analysis tasks are finished, hopefully some time tomorrow.

Thanks again!

Hello Tay,

The Analysis/Broken Inheritance tasks have been running for 22 hours now, currently processing the ""4. Analyze Trustee Differences"" job. The database files have grown by around 170GB already and growing, so with this rate of storage usage growth, I do not believe it will be able to complete the task before the database server runs out of free disk space. I will leave it running and see if the 20GB of the remaining free space is enough for it to complete. 

With that said, is it typical for the database files to take up the whole 400GB of disk space that we have allocated for the Netwrix SQL database? It does seem like an unreasonable amount of storage that it needs for the amount of objects it needs to process based on the requirements listed here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Solutions/FileSystem.htm

Thanks,
