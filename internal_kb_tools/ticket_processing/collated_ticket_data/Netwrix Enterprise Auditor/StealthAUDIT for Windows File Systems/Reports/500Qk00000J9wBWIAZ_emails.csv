Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


 

Kind regards

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location

	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hey Pasan

These steps are all done:

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend

  1.  Run FSAA System Scan job
I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB

  1.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening

  1.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday

  1.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


 

Kind regards

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location

	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

  1.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Mark,

Good morning.

Just following up to see if the testing has been done or if you are still waiting for the scans to finish.

Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3...

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.

  1.  Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
  2.  Fix open share (permissions)
  3.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  4.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  5.  Run FS_Open Shares job
While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


 

Kind regards

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3...

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.

  1.  Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
  2.  Fix open share (permissions)
  3.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  4.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  5.  Run FS_Open Shares job
While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


 

Kind regards

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hi Pasan

Sorry I thought I had replied.

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans I'd have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hey Pasan

These steps are all done:

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend

  1.  Run FSAA System Scan job
I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB

  1.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening

  1.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday

  1.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Thanks

Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3...

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.

  1.  Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
  2.  Fix open share (permissions)
  3.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  4.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  5.  Run FS_Open Shares job
While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion. 

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

 

Sorry I thought I had replied.

 

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans Iâ€™d have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Hi Mark,

Good morning.

Just following up to see if the testing has been done or if you are still waiting for the scans to finish.

Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


 

Kind regards

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hey Pasan

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, I'll need a couple of weeks.

Sorry!

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion.

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

Sorry I thought I had replied.

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans I'd have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

These steps are all done:

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend

  1.  Run FSAA System Scan job
I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB

  1.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening

  1.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday

  1.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Mark,

Good morning.

Just following up to see if the testing has been done or if you are still waiting for the scans to finish.

Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3...

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Kind regards

Hi Pasan

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.

  1.  Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
  2.  Fix open share (permissions)
  3.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  4.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  5.  Run FS_Open Shares job
While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hey Pasan

 

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, Iâ€™ll need a couple of weeks.

 

Sorry!

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion. 

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

 

Sorry I thought I had replied.

 

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans Iâ€™d have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Just one more thing I forgot to request you is logs after your testing. 
Please upload FSAA logs to the ticket as well.

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hey Pasan

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

Hey Pasan

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, I'll need a couple of weeks.

Sorry!

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion.

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

Sorry I thought I had replied.

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans I'd have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

These steps are all done:

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend

  1.  Run FSAA System Scan job
I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB

  1.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening

  1.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday

  1.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Thanks

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3...

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.

  1.  Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
  2.  Fix open share (permissions)
  3.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  4.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  5.  Run FS_Open Shares job
While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this link?

Hey Pasan

 

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

 

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

 

Regards

Hey Pasan

 

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, Iâ€™ll need a couple of weeks.

 

Sorry!

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion. 

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

 

Sorry I thought I had replied.

 

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans Iâ€™d have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000J9wBW:ref

 


Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Just one more thing I forgot to request you is logs after your testing. 
Please upload FSAA logs to the ticket as well.

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As we confirmed, there was a slight misunderstanding regarding the folder count, and the data displayed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, formerly known as StealthAudit, is accurate.
Since you plan to resolve these open shares/folders and rerun the scans, I suggest keeping the debug logs active. This will help us identify any issues that may arise through the logs.


I'll wait to hear back from you after testing.

Hi Mark,

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this link?

Hey Pasan

 

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

 

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

 

Regards

Hey Pasan

 

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, Iâ€™ll need a couple of weeks.

 

Sorry!

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion. 

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

 

Sorry I thought I had replied.

 

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans Iâ€™d have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000J9wBW:ref

 


Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Hi Mark,

Good morning.

Just following up to see if the testing has been done or if you are still waiting for the scans to finish.

Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


 

Kind regards

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As we confirmed, there was a slight misunderstanding regarding the folder count, and the data displayed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, formerly known as StealthAudit, is accurate.
Since you plan to resolve these open shares/folders and rerun the scans, I suggest keeping the debug logs active. This will help us identify any issues that may arise through the logs.


I'll wait to hear back from you after testing.

Hi Mark,

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this link<https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=twkr85CHsv9j4JVoYoesjcTq8eTv4Xj0noSmtQdRlAE-Z&MeetingID=h13BHekGwMWn.vwbqNPpCi7csN9aW8p662W3cyzgi8U-Z>?

Hey Pasan

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, I'll need a couple of weeks.

Sorry!

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion.

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

Sorry I thought I had replied.

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans I'd have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

These steps are all done:

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend

  1.  Run FSAA System Scan job
I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB

  1.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening

  1.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday

  1.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Thanks

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3...

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.

  1.  Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
  2.  Fix open share (permissions)
  3.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  4.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  5.  Run FS_Open Shares job
While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As we confirmed, there was a slight misunderstanding regarding the folder count, and the data displayed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, formerly known as StealthAudit, is accurate.
Since you plan to resolve these open shares/folders and rerun the scans, I suggest keeping the debug logs active. This will help us identify any issues that may arise through the logs.


I'll wait to hear back from you after testing.

Hi Mark,

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this  link?

Hey Pasan

 

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

 

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

Hey Pasan

 

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, Iâ€™ll need a couple of weeks.

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion. 

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

 

Sorry I thought I had replied.

 

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans Iâ€™d have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

I hope you are doing well.

The R&D team also reviewed the logs and couldn't find any issues when comparing the logs and information we shared. They suspect that the folders appear in the report but are not actually in the share due to a scan scoping query that might have excluded these shares/folders when the change occurred. I believe we also came to similar conclusion in our recent communication as well.

To investigate further, we need the Job XMLs and/or Applet logs from the scan during the period when these resources did not have their DeletedUSN updated to rule this out.

Since the application is functioning as expected, would you like to delve deeper and spend more time on this issue, or should we proceed with upgrading the environment and address any issues as they arise?
Please note that application upgrade is to keep the application up to date with all bug fixes etc and not related to this issue.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As we confirmed, there was a slight misunderstanding regarding the folder count, and the data displayed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, formerly known as StealthAudit, is accurate.
Since you plan to resolve these open shares/folders and rerun the scans, I suggest keeping the debug logs active. This will help us identify any issues that may arise through the logs.


I'll wait to hear back from you after testing.

Hi Mark,

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this  link?

Hey Pasan

 

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

 

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

Hey Pasan

 

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, Iâ€™ll need a couple of weeks.

 

Sorry!

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion. 

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.



Best regards,

Hi Pasan

 

Sorry I thought I had replied.

 

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans Iâ€™d have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hi Pasan

I am wondering whether the problem is mainly experienced with our shares in remote Isilon.  If you recall, our Master server is based in Sydney and that server scans Isilon in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth.  I have recently experienced the issue in Perth where I fixed the open share but the report informed me there were a few open folders which didn't exist.  I created them as there were only a few, re-scanned, imported and re-ran the report only for a different folder to be identified as open.

Why don't I enable debug logging on the Perth scan and the Import this weekend and see what happens?

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

The R&D team also reviewed the logs and couldn't find any issues when comparing the logs and information we shared. They suspect that the folders appear in the report but are not actually in the share due to a scan scoping query that might have excluded these shares/folders when the change occurred. I believe we also came to similar conclusion in our recent communication as well.

To investigate further, we need the Job XMLs and/or Applet logs from the scan during the period when these resources did not have their DeletedUSN updated to rule this out.

Since the application is functioning as expected, would you like to delve deeper and spend more time on this issue, or should we proceed with upgrading the environment and address any issues as they arise?
Please note that application upgrade is to keep the application up to date with all bug fixes etc and not related to this issue.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As we confirmed, there was a slight misunderstanding regarding the folder count, and the data displayed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, formerly known as StealthAudit, is accurate.
Since you plan to resolve these open shares/folders and rerun the scans, I suggest keeping the debug logs active. This will help us identify any issues that may arise through the logs.


I'll wait to hear back from you after testing.



Best regards,

Hi Mark,

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this link<https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=twkr85CHsv9j4JVoYoesjcTq8eTv4Xj0noSmtQdRlAE-Z&MeetingID=h13BHekGwMWn.vwbqNPpCi7csN9aW8p662W3cyzgi8U-Z>?

Hey Pasan

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

Hey Pasan

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, I'll need a couple of weeks.

Sorry!

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion.

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

Sorry I thought I had replied.

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans I'd have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

These steps are all done:

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend

  1.  Run FSAA System Scan job
I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB

  1.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening

  1.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday

  1.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Thanks

Hey Pasan

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3...

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.

  1.  Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
  2.  Fix open share (permissions)
  3.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  4.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  5.  Run FS_Open Shares job
While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hi Pasan

 

I am wondering whether the problem is mainly experienced with our shares in remote Isilon.  If you recall, our Master server is based in Sydney and that server scans Isilon in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth.  I have recently experienced the issue in Perth where I fixed the open share but the report informed me there were a few open folders which didnâ€™t exist.  I created them as there were only a few, re-scanned, imported and re-ran the report only for a different folder to be identified as open.

 

Why donâ€™t I enable debug logging on the Perth scan and the Import this weekend and see what happens?

 

Regards

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

The R&D team also reviewed the logs and couldn't find any issues when comparing the logs and information we shared. They suspect that the folders appear in the report but are not actually in the share due to a scan scoping query that might have excluded these shares/folders when the change occurred. I believe we also came to similar conclusion in our recent communication as well.

To investigate further, we need the Job XMLs and/or Applet logs from the scan during the period when these resources did not have their DeletedUSN updated to rule this out.

Since the application is functioning as expected, would you like to delve deeper and spend more time on this issue, or should we proceed with upgrading the environment and address any issues as they arise?
Please note that application upgrade is to keep the application up to date with all bug fixes etc and not related to this issue.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As we confirmed, there was a slight misunderstanding regarding the folder count, and the data displayed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, formerly known as StealthAudit, is accurate.
Since you plan to resolve these open shares/folders and rerun the scans, I suggest keeping the debug logs active. This will help us identify any issues that may arise through the logs.


I'll wait to hear back from you after testing.

Hi Mark,

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this  link?

Hey Pasan

 

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

 

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

 

Regards

Hey Pasan

 

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, Iâ€™ll need a couple of weeks.

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion. 

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

 

Sorry I thought I had replied.

 

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans Iâ€™d have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Hi Mark,

Good morning.

Just following up to see if the testing has been done or if you are still waiting for the scans to finish.

Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hi Pasan

 

I am wondering whether the problem is mainly experienced with our shares in remote Isilon.  If you recall, our Master server is based in Sydney and that server scans Isilon in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth.  I have recently experienced the issue in Perth where I fixed the open share but the report informed me there were a few open folders which didnâ€™t exist.  I created them as there were only a few, re-scanned, imported and re-ran the report only for a different folder to be identified as open.

 

Why donâ€™t I enable debug logging on the Perth scan and the Import this weekend and see what happens?

 

Regards

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

The R&D team also reviewed the logs and couldn't find any issues when comparing the logs and information we shared. They suspect that the folders appear in the report but are not actually in the share due to a scan scoping query that might have excluded these shares/folders when the change occurred. I believe we also came to similar conclusion in our recent communication as well.

To investigate further, we need the Job XMLs and/or Applet logs from the scan during the period when these resources did not have their DeletedUSN updated to rule this out.

Since the application is functioning as expected, would you like to delve deeper and spend more time on this issue, or should we proceed with upgrading the environment and address any issues as they arise?
Please note that application upgrade is to keep the application up to date with all bug fixes etc and not related to this issue.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As we confirmed, there was a slight misunderstanding regarding the folder count, and the data displayed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, formerly known as StealthAudit, is accurate.
Since you plan to resolve these open shares/folders and rerun the scans, I suggest keeping the debug logs active. This will help us identify any issues that may arise through the logs.


I'll wait to hear back from you after testing.

Hi Mark,

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this  link?

Hey Pasan

 

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

 

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

Hey Pasan

 

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, Iâ€™ll need a couple of weeks.

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion. 

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

 

Sorry I thought I had replied.

 

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans Iâ€™d have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hi Pasan

 

I am wondering whether the problem is mainly experienced with our shares in remote Isilon.  If you recall, our Master server is based in Sydney and that server scans Isilon in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth.  I have recently experienced the issue in Perth where I fixed the open share but the report informed me there were a few open folders which didnâ€™t exist.  I created them as there were only a few, re-scanned, imported and re-ran the report only for a different folder to be identified as open.

 

Why donâ€™t I enable debug logging on the Perth scan and the Import this weekend and see what happens?

 

Regards

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

The R&D team also reviewed the logs and couldn't find any issues when comparing the logs and information we shared. They suspect that the folders appear in the report but are not actually in the share due to a scan scoping query that might have excluded these shares/folders when the change occurred. I believe we also came to similar conclusion in our recent communication as well.

To investigate further, we need the Job XMLs and/or Applet logs from the scan during the period when these resources did not have their DeletedUSN updated to rule this out.

Since the application is functioning as expected, would you like to delve deeper and spend more time on this issue, or should we proceed with upgrading the environment and address any issues as they arise?
Please note that application upgrade is to keep the application up to date with all bug fixes etc and not related to this issue.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As we confirmed, there was a slight misunderstanding regarding the folder count, and the data displayed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, formerly known as StealthAudit, is accurate.
Since you plan to resolve these open shares/folders and rerun the scans, I suggest keeping the debug logs active. This will help us identify any issues that may arise through the logs.


I'll wait to hear back from you after testing.

Hi Mark,

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this  link?

Hey Pasan

 

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

 

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

 

Regards

Hey Pasan

 

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, Iâ€™ll need a couple of weeks.

 

Sorry!

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion. 

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

 

Sorry I thought I had replied.

 

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans Iâ€™d have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000J9wBW:ref

 


Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hi Pasan

Apologies for the delay.  I have attached recent FSAA scan and import logs to the ticket in the portal.

Upon completion of the scan and the import our report claims a New Folder (7) is open deep with in a share however it isn't there.  It did this previously with New Folder (5) so I created the folder only for it to complain about New Folder (6) which also wasn't present and now New Folder (7).

Sounds good to me.

Could you please share the details of the following sections under the FSAA job when you provide the logs and other relevant information after completing Perth host scan?

Hi Pasan

I am wondering whether the problem is mainly experienced with our shares in remote Isilon.  If you recall, our Master server is based in Sydney and that server scans Isilon in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth.  I have recently experienced the issue in Perth where I fixed the open share but the report informed me there were a few open folders which didn't exist.  I created them as there were only a few, re-scanned, imported and re-ran the report only for a different folder to be identified as open.

Why don't I enable debug logging on the Perth scan and the Import this weekend and see what happens?

Regards

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

The R&D team also reviewed the logs and couldn't find any issues when comparing the logs and information we shared. They suspect that the folders appear in the report but are not actually in the share due to a scan scoping query that might have excluded these shares/folders when the change occurred. I believe we also came to similar conclusion in our recent communication as well.

To investigate further, we need the Job XMLs and/or Applet logs from the scan during the period when these resources did not have their DeletedUSN updated to rule this out.

Since the application is functioning as expected, would you like to delve deeper and spend more time on this issue, or should we proceed with upgrading the environment and address any issues as they arise?
Please note that application upgrade is to keep the application up to date with all bug fixes etc and not related to this issue.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As we confirmed, there was a slight misunderstanding regarding the folder count, and the data displayed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, formerly known as StealthAudit, is accurate.
Since you plan to resolve these open shares/folders and rerun the scans, I suggest keeping the debug logs active. This will help us identify any issues that may arise through the logs.


I'll wait to hear back from you after testing.

Hi Mark,

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this link<https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=twkr85CHsv9j4JVoYoesjcTq8eTv4Xj0noSmtQdRlAE-Z&MeetingID=h13BHekGwMWn.vwbqNPpCi7csN9aW8p662W3cyzgi8U-Z>?

Hey Pasan

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, I'll need a couple of weeks.

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion.

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

Sorry I thought I had replied.

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans I'd have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

These steps are all done:

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend

  1.  Run FSAA System Scan job
I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB

  1.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening

  1.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday

  1.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Thanks

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3...

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.

  1.  Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
  2.  Fix open share (permissions)
  3.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  4.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  5.  Run FS_Open Shares job
While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hi Pasan

 

Apologies for the delay.  I have attached recent FSAA scan and import logs to the ticket in the portal.

 

Upon completion of the scan and the import our report claims a New Folder (7) is open deep with in a share however it isnâ€™t there.  It did this previously with New Folder (5) so I created the folder only for it to complain about New Folder (6) which also wasnâ€™t present and now New Folder (7).

Hi Pasan

 

I am wondering whether the problem is mainly experienced with our shares in remote Isilon.  If you recall, our Master server is based in Sydney and that server scans Isilon in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth.  I have recently experienced the issue in Perth where I fixed the open share but the report informed me there were a few open folders which didnâ€™t exist.  I created them as there were only a few, re-scanned, imported and re-ran the report only for a different folder to be identified as open.

 

Why donâ€™t I enable debug logging on the Perth scan and the Import this weekend and see what happens?

 

Regards

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

The R&D team also reviewed the logs and couldn't find any issues when comparing the logs and information we shared. They suspect that the folders appear in the report but are not actually in the share due to a scan scoping query that might have excluded these shares/folders when the change occurred. I believe we also came to similar conclusion in our recent communication as well.

To investigate further, we need the Job XMLs and/or Applet logs from the scan during the period when these resources did not have their DeletedUSN updated to rule this out.

Since the application is functioning as expected, would you like to delve deeper and spend more time on this issue, or should we proceed with upgrading the environment and address any issues as they arise?
Please note that application upgrade is to keep the application up to date with all bug fixes etc and not related to this issue.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As we confirmed, there was a slight misunderstanding regarding the folder count, and the data displayed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, formerly known as StealthAudit, is accurate.
Since you plan to resolve these open shares/folders and rerun the scans, I suggest keeping the debug logs active. This will help us identify any issues that may arise through the logs.


I'll wait to hear back from you after testing.

Hi Mark,

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this  link?

Hey Pasan

 

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

 

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

 

Regards

Hey Pasan

 

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, Iâ€™ll need a couple of weeks.

 

Sorry!

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion. 

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

 

Sorry I thought I had replied.

 

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans Iâ€™d have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000J9wBW:ref

 


Hey Pasan

 

These steps are all done:


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location


I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend


	Run FSAA System Scan job


I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB


	Run FSAA Bulk import job


Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening


	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results


So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday


	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Thanks

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

 

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3â€¦


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

 

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

 

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.


	Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	Fix open share (permissions)
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job


While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?


	Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
	Remove the folder from the share location
	Run FSAA System Scan job
	Run FSAA Bulk import job
	Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
	Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']


Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.

Hi Pasan

Apologies for the delay.  I have attached recent FSAA scan and import logs to the ticket in the portal.

Upon completion of the scan and the import our report claims a New Folder (7) is open deep with in a share however it isn't there.  It did this previously with New Folder (5) so I created the folder only for it to complain about New Folder (6) which also wasn't present and now New Folder (7).

Hi Pasan

I am wondering whether the problem is mainly experienced with our shares in remote Isilon.  If you recall, our Master server is based in Sydney and that server scans Isilon in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth.  I have recently experienced the issue in Perth where I fixed the open share but the report informed me there were a few open folders which didn't exist.  I created them as there were only a few, re-scanned, imported and re-ran the report only for a different folder to be identified as open.

Why don't I enable debug logging on the Perth scan and the Import this weekend and see what happens?

Regards

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

The R&D team also reviewed the logs and couldn't find any issues when comparing the logs and information we shared. They suspect that the folders appear in the report but are not actually in the share due to a scan scoping query that might have excluded these shares/folders when the change occurred. I believe we also came to similar conclusion in our recent communication as well.

To investigate further, we need the Job XMLs and/or Applet logs from the scan during the period when these resources did not have their DeletedUSN updated to rule this out.

Since the application is functioning as expected, would you like to delve deeper and spend more time on this issue, or should we proceed with upgrading the environment and address any issues as they arise?
Please note that application upgrade is to keep the application up to date with all bug fixes etc and not related to this issue.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As we confirmed, there was a slight misunderstanding regarding the folder count, and the data displayed in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, formerly known as StealthAudit, is accurate.
Since you plan to resolve these open shares/folders and rerun the scans, I suggest keeping the debug logs active. This will help us identify any issues that may arise through the logs.


I'll wait to hear back from you after testing.

Hi Mark,

We are still investigating the cause of this issue, and we cannot say for sure when you upgrade if this will be resolved. Once we have the logs of your testing, we'll be in a better position to suggest a way forward.

I would like to review and gather some information regarding these folders count mismatch you mentioned. Can you please book a meeting with me via this link<https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=twkr85CHsv9j4JVoYoesjcTq8eTv4Xj0noSmtQdRlAE-Z&MeetingID=h13BHekGwMWn.vwbqNPpCi7csN9aW8p662W3cyzgi8U-Z>?

Hey Pasan

In the meantime, have you been able to confirm with R&D whether upgrading will definitely fix the problem?

I have been reviewing a share that StealthAudit believes contains close to 800,000 open folders however, upon investigation the share contains 150,000 folders.

Is there a work-around we can use to reset the scan data for examples like this?  Can we edit the DB?  Can we delete the host information in the DB and let it scan the host again?

Realistically I wont be able to perform a FSAA scan until Friday and perform a FSAA import until Monday.  To do it twice, I'll need a couple of weeks.

Hi Mark,

I requested the FSAA logs, but I realize I should have been more specific. I apologize for any confusion.

We would need FSAA scan logs and bulk import logs for us to review the entire process of scanning/importing.
Can you kindly redo the process and share the logs along with the screenshots?

If you could let me know a date by which you can deliver these, I'll put the ticket on hold until then.

Hi Pasan

Sorry I thought I had replied.

You only asked for debug logs for the import, not the FSAA scans.  If you want the debug logs for the scans I'd have to run them again.  Do you want me to create the test folder and run through the whole process again?

Hi Mark,

Thank you for the confirmation.

It shows that scans are picking up deleted folders and removing DB records successfully. I am uncertain what caused some folders not to be removed from DB once they got deleted from the host last time.

I'll cross reference the old logs & queries to the new ones and see if I can identify any discrepancy. I'll get R&D eyes on this too.

I see you have uploaded FSAA bulk import logs, can you please upload FSAA system scan logs as well.

Hi Mark,

I reviewed the StealthAudit troubleshooting doc you shared and in step 4, I can see the new folder is getting picked up from the scan and in the step 9 was it not getting picked up?

Hey Pasan

These steps are all done:

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
I am waiting until Friday to kick off the FSAA system scan as our Storage team like us to scan outside of business hours these days and the scan will take most of the weekend

  1.  Run FSAA System Scan job
I will then amend the logs for the FSAA Bulk import job so debug logs are generated.  This job will start at 6am on Monday and ingest any data scanned over the weekend into the DB

  1.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
Then the FS_Open scan will scan at 6pm on Monday evening

  1.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
So I should be in a position to perform this test on Tuesday

  1.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Thanks

Hi Mark,

Good morning.

Just following up to see if the testing has been done or if you are still waiting for the scans to finish.

Hi Mark,

Yes, I would like to see debug logs.

You are correct, I want the logs collected after point 8.

Hey Pasan

Do you want debug logs?

Can I assume we just want logs when we are up to point 8 on our testing?  Seems pointless to give you logs on point 3...

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Just one more thing I forgot to request you is logs after your testing.
Please upload FSAA logs to the ticket as well.

Hi Pasan

Thanks for your time on our call yesterday.

I will proceed with your plan that you have outlined below, but please bear with me.  My open shares are now all on some fairly large Isilon that take many hours/days to scan, the import takes a few hours and the Open Share report takes close to 12 hours to run.

I will make a start but its unlikely I will have a result for you until late next week.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Thank you for your time earlier in the meeting.

As confirmed, you actioned below steps to generate a clean report without wrong information.

  1.  Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
  2.  Fix open share (permissions)
  3.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  4.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  5.  Run FS_Open Shares job
While I get the confirmation from our product team that an upgrade will certainly fix the issue you were having, can you please do below test and share results with me?

  1.  Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
  2.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  3.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  4.  Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
  5.  Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
  6.  Remove the folder from the share location
  7.  Run FSAA System Scan job
  8.  Run FSAA Bulk import job
  9.  Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
  10. Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
Please add screenshots of the reports and query return results to the ticket.


I'm just trying to determine if the deleted folders are not getting picked up by the FSAA job.


Thank you for taking up your time to conduct these testing.
