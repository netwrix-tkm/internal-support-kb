@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer Could you gather a screenshot from the resource table to validate the USN values? If the item has indeed been deleted, we then likely need to run a new permissions scan.

They didn't have issues with FSAA scans previously, but since it was not updating this folder - I suspected there might be discrepancies between database and t2 files, so I've suggested to run a repair, but it looks like it introduced another issue, here's customer's comment:

""Following on from my previous email, the job that I ran to repair the DB for my  Isilon in Adelaide and Melbourne completed successfully.

I then turned my attention to running a FSAA scan for the same Isilon but the job terminated early with this warning in the messages “No need to scan, host not present in Tier 1, needs bulk import”.  I should add that the bulk import ran on Monday and I hadn’t performed a FSAA scan since then.  Is that expected?

I have run a bulk import and on the whole that has worked and I am now able to initiate a FSAA scan for my hosts.  However, I should add though that for one of my hosts the bulk import reported this problem:

System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException (0x80131904): The MERGE statement conflicted with the REFERENCE constraint ""FK_SA_FSAA_Exceptions_GateID"". The conflict occurred in database ""StealthAudit"", table ""dbo.SA_FSAA_Exceptions"".""

However, with the bad past experience (upgrades did not fix issues) they want us to give more information on how an upgrade will fix this issue. Would you be able to provide some clarity?

They were able to fix the issue they were seeing in the reports by following below actions. (Temp solution to get clean reports with correct information)

	1. Created all open share missing folders matching the folder names show in NEA within your file servers
	2. Fix open share (permissions)

@Salesforce Hi Pasan, as I understood the situation for this customer, we were still awaiting logs for FSAA scan and bulk import. We could get and confirm their USN values, and it looked like the affected folder was not marked as deleted. So a new scan is not needed, and since bulk import was completed and the error occurred on the new scan, there seems to be something that development will need to investigate. So I'm unsure of where upgrading was proposed.

This is exactly what I thought. I requested customer to action below and share the results with me.

-Create a new folder in one of the open share locations
-Run FSAA System Scan job
-Run FSAA Bulk import job
-Run FS_Open Shares job (Ensure the folder is getting captured in the report) get a screenshot of the results
-Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']
-Remove the folder from the share location
-Run FSAA System Scan job
-Run FSAA Bulk import job
-Run FS_Open Shares job and get a screenshot of the results
-Execute this query against the DB, export the results [select * from sa_fsaa_resources where name ='yourtestfoldername']

@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer

Am I correct in interpreting the .xlsx and .docx files when I say that
they show scans are picking up created and deleted resources correctly now?

Did the workaround fix all folders that were not correctly marked as deleted?
If so, and it is not recurring, it sounds like that is not a current issue?

Does 1 host still have problems with the exceptions table?
Did they run CreateSchema after upgrading to 11.5?
If the BI Gates merge errored, it indicates the Exceptions table's FK does not have
the on delete cascade clause.
In sql server, you can right click that table > script table as > create to
to verify.
If that FK does not have the on delete cascade clause, running CreateSchema
will update it.

What is the current issue here?

Let me recap this from the beginning.

Initially, there were folders showing in the reports that are no longer exists in the share. After attempting to run FSAA scans & bulk imports multiple times and run create schema job did not remove non-existent folders from the report. 
Customer went on and recreate all those folders (about 160 of them) fixed the permission and re do the scans and now they have clean report with correct data. 

Just to ensure the deleted items are being captured fine with the scans, recent tests were performed, and they were successful.

What they want to know is a possible cause of their initial issue as to why the non-existent folders are not removed from report/results after the scans.
Can this be provided?

Just to reiterate, to my knowledge currently they don't have any issues. Which is a good thing.","0054u000007p5dwAAA","2025-04-11T00:34:27.000Z","2025-04-11T00:34:27.000Z","false","false"

@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer

Glad to hear there is no current issue.

SA_FSAA_Resources SQL Query.xlsx shows the resource 3757510 has a USN of 294. While SA_FSAA_SharesTraversalView SQL.xlsx does not show the USN of this resource, it does show that the resource 3858286 has a ResourceDeletedUSN of 299.
This leads me to believe the last time the resource was in scope of a scan and import was USN 294 because this host was up to at least USN 299 in order to mark 3858286 as deleted. 
There is a .png showing unlimited scan depth, however scoping options or scoping queries could have been excluding these shares/folders, thus changes were not picked up by the scans.
We would need Job XMLS and/or Applet logs from the scan during the time period when these resources were not having their DeletedUSN updated to rule this out. They would tell us if these shares/folders were excluded for some reason, or if there were other problems during the scan. We were only given job logs from this time period.
Current job XMLS / applet logs would not be useful in determining how things were configured when the problem was described back in January.

Scoping options could be the reason these folders were not marked as deleted by the scans, which would mean after importing and re-running the OpenAccess job, they would still be present in the reports.

The customer completed the scan and import at the Perth site and received a result indicating ""New folder 7"" as an open share, but this folder is not present in the specified path.

All relevant screenshots and logs are attached in the ""Perth site scan results"" folder.

Please review this information and let me know if you identify any issues.

I've asked them to send screenshots of their scan scopes, and it appears there are no settings that would prevent this path from being scanned or identifying that the share is not present.","0054u000007p5dwAAA","2025-04-30T23:54:29.000Z","2025-04-30T23:54:29.000Z","false","false"

This can happen if the folder existed, got scanned, then was deleted or renamed afterwards. Since this resource has the default folder name when creating 8 folders (7), this makes me think it is the case.

The next scan with this resource's location in scope should identify this. Then when that data is imported, exceptions job is run, and OpenAccess is run, that should be reflected in the reports.

Just to clarify on this,

They don't have any scope set for the resource so I'm expecting the entire resource to be scanned. Is my understanding correct?

What you are saying is after the scan job runs and data is imported, exceptions job is run, and OpenAccess is run, that should be reflected in the reports.

In other words, no matter if the folder is moved or name has been chnaged it should not show folder name (new folder 7 as per customer testing) in the report?","0054u000007p5dwAAA","2025-05-05T04:16:32.000Z","2025-05-05T04:16:32.000Z","false","false"
