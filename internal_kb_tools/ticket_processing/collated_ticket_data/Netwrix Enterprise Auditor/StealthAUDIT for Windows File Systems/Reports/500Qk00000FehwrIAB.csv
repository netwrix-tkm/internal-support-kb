"500Qk00000FehwrIAB","00420763","Support Ticket","FileSystemOverview Error","Hi team

When running the FileSystemOverview report I get the error listed below:

""Arithmetic overflow error converting expression to data type int.""

Researching this problem, this error in SQL occurs when an operation results in a value that exceeds the limits of the int data type. In SQL Server, for example, the int data type has a range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. If a calculation or operation results in a value beyond this range, you'll encounter this error.

What can we do to fix it as I want to ensure this report is correct.

Regards","","The customer wants to run the FileSystemOverview report in NEA but was getting an error message: Arithmetic overflow error converting expression to data type int. Team on SWAT suggested running FS_Schema instant job. However, after running that job customer is getting errors in FSAA Bulk Import and FSA_Schema job too. These errors refer some DB tables that are not present.","Dev team has asked for an escalation. However, prior to that, list of DB tables is required so that issue can be sorted out at earliest.","Ran the FS_Create schema job to update the schemas and customer confirmed has was able to run the file system overview job successfully.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Pasan Illege","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Reports","11.5","11.5.0.165","60.9","Closed - Resolved","Westpac Banking Corporation","Mark Chambers","2024-09-12T02:14:54.000Z","2024-11-12T00:49:25.000Z"
