"500Qk00000IU958IAD","00427456","Support Ticket","FileSystem StaleContent Job Incorrect","For some reason the File System Stale content job is showing incorrect data. It only has two shares in the job when in reality it should be more. Already attempted to replace job files with solution in Instant Solutions and reran job. This is used in upper management reporting feature.","","Job thinks it's completing successfully, since there are no errors in the log","Review the job configuration to see what the time frame is on their stale data","The FS_StaleContent_ShareSummary analysis task does not correctly pull the data needed. We adjusted the script to what is written below to get the job running. An internal escalation (Ticket #00428218) has been raised to get the job working for other customers.
