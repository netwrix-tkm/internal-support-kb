Hi Pasan

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: ""Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.""
I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

Response by early next week is highly unlikely with medium priority.

I have bump it up to high and I hope we'll get a response soon. Once I have an update, I'll reach out to you.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:




SELECT table_name









FROM information_schema.tables









WHERE table_type = 'base table';

Have a great day!

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:

  1.  FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don't use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
  2.  When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error:
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

Hi team

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

I'm not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

Hi Mark,

To verify if the change has been successful after running the job, please login to SQL Server via SSMS and execute the following query against the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB:


























sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes
You may also execute this on DB before executing the job and compare the results afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Mark

My apologies for delay in reply.

1. If are running this against a seperate database (i.e. test has independent db) then this is not a problem, it should give an indication of time to run.
2. Default is inheriting the host list from above, however this job is a list of SQL scripts which do not reference host list, therefore this setting is not relevant and can be left as default.
3. If this has run successfully, the Status | TaskStats should show as ""success"" for all the scripts. We can also run sp_help against the FSAA tables to verify the data type for the ID value. If you need assistance with this we can provide steps.


Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Ilia

Just to recap my questions are:


  1.  Before I run this job in prod, I would like to run it in test.  We don't seem to have the same problem in test which isn't surprising considering there is less data.  So, is there a risk if I run the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment?
  2.  When configuring the job I am presented with this prompt.  I assume I can leave it as default as it doesn't matter if all or none of the hosts are selected in the Hosts list as the job is going to run against the entire DB anyway?

  3.  And lastly, what is the best way to confirm its run correctly?  Would it be to confirm the job finishes with Success?  Is thee another way I can verify the int has been updated to bigint?

Hi Ilai

Following on from my previous question, I assume I just leave this option as shown below?  I assume it doesn't need me to select all the different hosts as its going to run against the entire DB?

Hi Ilia

I am planning on running the FS_MigrateSchema job in our test environment.  This doesn't have a problem when I run the FilSystemOverview job.

Is there any risk with me running the FS_MigrateSchema job and changing the int type to bigint even though it doesn't have the problem?

Hi Ilia

I am a little nervous about running this job on our DB.  I think I will raise a change that will cover this activity which will include a DB backup with the option of restoring the DB if we encounter some problems.

I assume this job is likely to take a long time to run?

Hi Pasan

 

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: “Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.”

I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

I have escalated this ticket to R&D team to investigate this further and provide us a solution.

As the ticket is logged as medium severity, I have escalated it with the same. Please let me know if you need to bump up the severity.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:
 



SELECT table_name 



 



 


 



 


FROM information_schema.tables 



 



 


 



 


WHERE table_type = 'base table';



Have a great day!

I ran the import job again and it worked without any errors.  Not sure what happened there as it had failed twice today already.  Will try again and report back.

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

 

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

 

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:


	FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don’t use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
	When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error: 


Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

 

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

 

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

 

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

 

Regards

Hi team

 

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

 

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

 

I’m not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

Hi Mark,

To verify if the change has been successful after running the job, please login to SQL Server via SSMS and execute the following query against the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB:
 




 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes


You may also execute this on DB before executing the job and compare the results afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Mark

My apologies for delay in reply.

1. If are running this against a seperate database (i.e. test has independent db) then this is not a problem, it should give an indication of time to run.
2. Default is inheriting the host list from above, however this job is a list of SQL scripts which do not reference host list, therefore this setting is not relevant and can be left as default.
3. If this has run successfully, the Status | TaskStats should show as ""success"" for all the scripts. We can also run sp_help against the FSAA tables to verify the data type for the ID value. If you need assistance with this we can provide steps.


Thank you,
Alex Buchta
Technical Support Manager

Hi Ilia

 

Just to recap my questions are:

 


	Before I run this job in prod, I would like to run it in test.  We don’t seem to have the same problem in test which isn’t surprising considering there is less data.  So, is there a risk if I run the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment?
	When configuring the job I am presented with this prompt.  I assume I can leave it as default as it doesn’t matter if all or none of the hosts are selected in the Hosts list as the job is going to run against the entire DB anyway?
	
	And lastly, what is the best way to confirm its run correctly?  Would it be to confirm the job finishes with Success?  Is thee another way I can verify the int has been updated to bigint?


 

Regards

Hi Ilai

 

Following on from my previous question, I assume I just leave this option as shown below?  I assume it doesn’t need me to select all the different hosts as its going to run against the entire DB?

Hi Ilia

 

I am planning on running the FS_MigrateSchema job in our test environment.  This doesn’t have a problem when I run the FilSystemOverview job.

 

Is there any risk with me running the FS_MigrateSchema job and changing the int type to bigint even though it doesn’t have the problem?

Hi Ilia

 

I am a little nervous about running this job on our DB.  I think I will raise a change that will cover this activity which will include a DB backup with the option of restoring the DB if we encounter some problems.

 

I assume this job is likely to take a long time to run?

Dear Mark,

I wanted to follow up because I have not heard from you since my last email. May I ask what the current status of the issue is? Did the previous email that I sent answer your questions and resolve your issues?

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance on this  case .

Hey Pasan

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please...

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn't impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: ""Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.""
I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:




SELECT table_name

























FROM information_schema.tables

























WHERE table_type = 'base table';

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

Hi team

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:

  1.  FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don't use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
  2.  When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error:
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

Hi team

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

I'm not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

Hi Mark,

To verify if the change has been successful after running the job, please login to SQL Server via SSMS and execute the following query against the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB:




































































sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes
You may also execute this on DB before executing the job and compare the results afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Mark

My apologies for delay in reply.

1. If are running this against a seperate database (i.e. test has independent db) then this is not a problem, it should give an indication of time to run.
2. Default is inheriting the host list from above, however this job is a list of SQL scripts which do not reference host list, therefore this setting is not relevant and can be left as default.
3. If this has run successfully, the Status | TaskStats should show as ""success"" for all the scripts. We can also run sp_help against the FSAA tables to verify the data type for the ID value. If you need assistance with this we can provide steps.


Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Ilia

Just to recap my questions are:


  1.  Before I run this job in prod, I would like to run it in test.  We don't seem to have the same problem in test which isn't surprising considering there is less data.  So, is there a risk if I run the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment?
  2.  When configuring the job I am presented with this prompt.  I assume I can leave it as default as it doesn't matter if all or none of the hosts are selected in the Hosts list as the job is going to run against the entire DB anyway?
[cid:image003.png@01DB2F97.916D2CE0]
  3.  And lastly, what is the best way to confirm its run correctly?  Would it be to confirm the job finishes with Success?  Is thee another way I can verify the int has been updated to bigint?

Hey Pasan

 

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please…

 

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn’t impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

 

Kind regards

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

 

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: “Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.”

I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:
 



SELECT table_name 



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


FROM information_schema.tables 



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


WHERE table_type = 'base table';



Have a great day!

Hi Saqib

 

The Import job was working as I had temporarily unticked Update Statistics:

 



 

With this selected again the job fails.

I have uploaded logs to the call on the portal.

 

Password is the same as before.

Hi Saqib

 

I have uploaded the debug log for FS_MigrateSchema to the call in the portal.

I ran the import job again and it worked without any errors.  Not sure what happened there as it had failed twice today already.  Will try again and report back.

 

The password for the file is:

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

 

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

 

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:


	FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don’t use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
	When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error: 


Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

 

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

 

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

 

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

 

Regards

Hi team

 

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

 

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

 

I’m not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

Hi Mark,

To verify if the change has been successful after running the job, please login to SQL Server via SSMS and execute the following query against the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB:
 




 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes


You may also execute this on DB before executing the job and compare the results afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Mark

My apologies for delay in reply.

1. If are running this against a seperate database (i.e. test has independent db) then this is not a problem, it should give an indication of time to run.
2. Default is inheriting the host list from above, however this job is a list of SQL scripts which do not reference host list, therefore this setting is not relevant and can be left as default.
3. If this has run successfully, the Status | TaskStats should show as ""success"" for all the scripts. We can also run sp_help against the FSAA tables to verify the data type for the ID value. If you need assistance with this we can provide steps.


Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Ilia

 

Just to recap my questions are:

 


	Before I run this job in prod, I would like to run it in test.  We don’t seem to have the same problem in test which isn’t surprising considering there is less data.  So, is there a risk if I run the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment?
	When configuring the job I am presented with this prompt.  I assume I can leave it as default as it doesn’t matter if all or none of the hosts are selected in the Hosts list as the job is going to run against the entire DB anyway?
	
	And lastly, what is the best way to confirm its run correctly?  Would it be to confirm the job finishes with Success?  Is thee another way I can verify the int has been updated to bigint?

Following on from my previous question, I assume I just leave this option as shown below?  I assume it doesn’t need me to select all the different hosts as its going to run against the entire DB?

I am planning on running the FS_MigrateSchema job in our test environment.  This doesn’t have a problem when I run the FilSystemOverview job.

 

Is there any risk with me running the FS_MigrateSchema job and changing the int type to bigint even though it doesn’t have the problem?

I am a little nervous about running this job on our DB.  I think I will raise a change that will cover this activity which will include a DB backup with the option of restoring the DB if we encounter some problems.

 

I assume this job is likely to take a long time to run?

Hey Pasan

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please...

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn't impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: ""Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.""
I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

Response by early next week is highly unlikely with medium priority.

I have bump it up to high and I hope we'll get a response soon. Once I have an update, I'll reach out to you.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:




SELECT table_name



































































FROM information_schema.tables



































































WHERE table_type = 'base table';

Have a great day!

The Import job was working as I had temporarily unticked Update Statistics:

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:

  1.  FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don't use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
  2.  When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error:
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

Hi team

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

I'm not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

Hi Mark,

To verify if the change has been successful after running the job, please login to SQL Server via SSMS and execute the following query against the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB:


















































































































































































sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes
You may also execute this on DB before executing the job and compare the results afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Mark

My apologies for delay in reply.

1. If are running this against a seperate database (i.e. test has independent db) then this is not a problem, it should give an indication of time to run.
2. Default is inheriting the host list from above, however this job is a list of SQL scripts which do not reference host list, therefore this setting is not relevant and can be left as default.
3. If this has run successfully, the Status | TaskStats should show as ""success"" for all the scripts. We can also run sp_help against the FSAA tables to verify the data type for the ID value. If you need assistance with this we can provide steps.


Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Ilia

Just to recap my questions are:


  1.  Before I run this job in prod, I would like to run it in test.  We don't seem to have the same problem in test which isn't surprising considering there is less data.  So, is there a risk if I run the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment?
  2.  When configuring the job I am presented with this prompt.  I assume I can leave it as default as it doesn't matter if all or none of the hosts are selected in the Hosts list as the job is going to run against the entire DB anyway?
[cid:image003.png@01DB2F9D.A2048DE0]
  3.  And lastly, what is the best way to confirm its run correctly?  Would it be to confirm the job finishes with Success?  Is thee another way I can verify the int has been updated to bigint?

Subject: RE: FileSystemOverview Error

Hi Ilia

I am planning on running the FS_MigrateSchema job in our test environment.  This doesn't have a problem when I run the FilSystemOverview job.

Is there any risk with me running the FS_MigrateSchema job and changing the int type to bigint even though it doesn't have the problem?

Hi Ilia

I am a little nervous about running this job on our DB.  I think I will raise a change that will cover this activity which will include a DB backup with the option of restoring the DB if we encounter some problems.

I assume this job is likely to take a long time to run?

I updated the escalation with this information. 

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

 

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please…

 

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn’t impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

 

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: “Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.”

I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

I have escalated this ticket to R&D team to investigate this further and provide us a solution.

As the ticket is logged as medium severity, I have escalated it with the same. Please let me know if you need to bump up the severity.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:
 



SELECT table_name 



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


FROM information_schema.tables 



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


WHERE table_type = 'base table';



Have a great day!

I ran the import job again and it worked without any errors.  Not sure what happened there as it had failed twice today already.  Will try again and report back.

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

 

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

 

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:


	FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don’t use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
	When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error: 


Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

 

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

 

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

 

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

Hi team

 

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

 

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

 

I’m not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

Hi Saqib

 

No I haven’t been able to do this yet.  I have a few days off in the next week so I plan to do our test environment on the 31st October and our production environment on 5th November.

Hi Mark,

To verify if the change has been successful after running the job, please login to SQL Server via SSMS and execute the following query against the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB:

Hi Mark

My apologies for delay in reply.

1. If are running this against a seperate database (i.e. test has independent db) then this is not a problem, it should give an indication of time to run.
2. Default is inheriting the host list from above, however this job is a list of SQL scripts which do not reference host list, therefore this setting is not relevant and can be left as default.
3. If this has run successfully, the Status | TaskStats should show as ""success"" for all the scripts. We can also run sp_help against the FSAA tables to verify the data type for the ID value. If you need assistance with this we can provide steps.


Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Ilia

 

Just to recap my questions are:

 


	Before I run this job in prod, I would like to run it in test.  We don’t seem to have the same problem in test which isn’t surprising considering there is less data.  So, is there a risk if I run the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment?
	When configuring the job I am presented with this prompt.  I assume I can leave it as default as it doesn’t matter if all or none of the hosts are selected in the Hosts list as the job is going to run against the entire DB anyway?
	
	And lastly, what is the best way to confirm its run correctly?  Would it be to confirm the job finishes with Success?  Is thee another way I can verify the int has been updated to bigint?

Hi Ilai

 

Following on from my previous question, I assume I just leave this option as shown below?  I assume it doesn’t need me to select all the different hosts as its going to run against the entire DB?

Hi Ilia

 

I am planning on running the FS_MigrateSchema job in our test environment.  This doesn’t have a problem when I run the FilSystemOverview job.

 

Is there any risk with me running the FS_MigrateSchema job and changing the int type to bigint even though it doesn’t have the problem?

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log. 

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information. 

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

 

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please…

 

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn’t impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

 

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: “Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.”

I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:
 

SELECT table_name 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

FROM information_schema.tables 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

WHERE table_type = 'base table';

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib

 

I have uploaded the debug log for FS_MigrateSchema to the call in the portal.

I ran the import job again and it worked without any errors.  Not sure what happened there as it had failed twice today already.  Will try again and report back.

 

The password for the file is:

Hi Mark,

Thank you for sharing the information in detail. Can you please share the Debug logs for the jobs you have mentioned? I would like to discuss this with the product team before suggesting any solution.

Have a great day!

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

 

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

 

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:

FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don’t use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error: 

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

 

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

 

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

 

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

 

Regards

Hi team

 

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

 

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

 

I’m not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

Hi Mark,

To verify if the change has been successful after running the job, please login to SQL Server via SSMS and execute the following query against the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB:
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes

You may also execute this on DB before executing the job and compare the results afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Mark

My apologies for delay in reply.

1. If are running this against a seperate database (i.e. test has independent db) then this is not a problem, it should give an indication of time to run.
2. Default is inheriting the host list from above, however this job is a list of SQL scripts which do not reference host list, therefore this setting is not relevant and can be left as default.
3. If this has run successfully, the Status | TaskStats should show as ""success"" for all the scripts. We can also run sp_help against the FSAA tables to verify the data type for the ID value. If you need assistance with this we can provide steps.

Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Ilia

 

Just to recap my questions are:

 

Before I run this job in prod, I would like to run it in test.  We don’t seem to have the same problem in test which isn’t surprising considering there is less data.  So, is there a risk if I run the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment?When configuring the job I am presented with this prompt.  I assume I can leave it as default as it doesn’t matter if all or none of the hosts are selected in the Hosts list as the job is going to run against the entire DB anyway?
	[Inline image name : image003.png]And lastly, what is the best way to confirm its run correctly?  Would it be to confirm the job finishes with Success?  Is thee another way I can verify the int has been updated to bigint?

 

Regards

Following on from my previous question, I assume I just leave this option as shown below?  I assume it doesn’t need me to select all the different hosts as its going to run against the entire DB?

I am planning on running the FS_MigrateSchema job in our test environment.  This doesn’t have a problem when I run the FilSystemOverview job.

 

Is there any risk with me running the FS_MigrateSchema job and changing the int type to bigint even though it doesn’t have the problem?

Hi Pasan

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

[cid:image001.png@01DB3053.4129AA30]

We don't use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log.

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information.

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please...

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn't impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: ""Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.""
I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

Response by early next week is highly unlikely with medium priority.

I have bump it up to high and I hope we'll get a response soon. Once I have an update, I'll reach out to you.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:




SELECT table_name







































































































































FROM information_schema.tables







































































































































WHERE table_type = 'base table';

Have a great day!

The Import job was working as I had temporarily unticked Update Statistics:

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:

  1.  FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don't use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
  2.  When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error:
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

Hi team

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

I'm not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

Hi Mark,

To verify if the change has been successful after running the job, please login to SQL Server via SSMS and execute the following query against the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB:




































































































































































































































































































































































sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes
You may also execute this on DB before executing the job and compare the results afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Mark

My apologies for delay in reply.

1. If are running this against a seperate database (i.e. test has independent db) then this is not a problem, it should give an indication of time to run.
2. Default is inheriting the host list from above, however this job is a list of SQL scripts which do not reference host list, therefore this setting is not relevant and can be left as default.
3. If this has run successfully, the Status | TaskStats should show as ""success"" for all the scripts. We can also run sp_help against the FSAA tables to verify the data type for the ID value. If you need assistance with this we can provide steps.


Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Ilia

Just to recap my questions are:


  1.  Before I run this job in prod, I would like to run it in test.  We don't seem to have the same problem in test which isn't surprising considering there is less data.  So, is there a risk if I run the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment?
  2.  When configuring the job I am presented with this prompt.  I assume I can leave it as default as it doesn't matter if all or none of the hosts are selected in the Hosts list as the job is going to run against the entire DB anyway?
[cid:image004.png@01DB3053.4129AA30]
  3.  And lastly, what is the best way to confirm its run correctly?  Would it be to confirm the job finishes with Success?  Is thee another way I can verify the int has been updated to bigint?

Subject: RE: FileSystemOverview Error

Hi Ilia

I am planning on running the FS_MigrateSchema job in our test environment.  This doesn't have a problem when I run the FilSystemOverview job.

Is there any risk with me running the FS_MigrateSchema job and changing the int type to bigint even though it doesn't have the problem?

I recommend you match the settings in Prod to Test environment and do the testing, so we know if any issues arise prior performing anything in Prod.

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

 

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

 



 

We don’t use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

 

Regards

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log. 

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information. 

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

 

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please…

 

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn’t impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

 

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: “Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.”

I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

Response by early next week is highly unlikely with medium priority.

I have bump it up to high and I hope we'll get a response soon. Once I have an update, I'll reach out to you.

I have escalated this ticket to R&D team to investigate this further and provide us a solution.

As the ticket is logged as medium severity, I have escalated it with the same. Please let me know if you need to bump up the severity.

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

 

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

 

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:


	FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don’t use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
	When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error: 


Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

 

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

 

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

 

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

Hi team

 

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

 

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

 

I’m not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

 

Regards

Hi Saqib

 

No I haven’t been able to do this yet.  I have a few days off in the next week so I plan to do our test environment on the 31st October and our production environment on 5th November.

Hi Pasan

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

[cid:image002.png@01DB305D.7CF9F790]

We don't use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log.

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information.

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please...

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn't impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: ""Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.""
I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Response by early next week is highly unlikely with medium priority.

I have bump it up to high and I hope we'll get a response soon. Once I have an update, I'll reach out to you.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:




SELECT table_name



















































































































































































































































































































































FROM information_schema.tables



















































































































































































































































































































































WHERE table_type = 'base table';

Have a great day!

Hi Saqib

The Import job was working as I had temporarily unticked Update Statistics:

With this selected again the job fails.

I have uploaded logs to the call on the portal.

Password is the same as before.

Hi Saqib

I have uploaded the debug log for FS_MigrateSchema to the call in the portal.
I ran the import job again and it worked without any errors.  Not sure what happened there as it had failed twice today already.  Will try again and report back.

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:

  1.  FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don't use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
  2.  When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error:
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

Hi team

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

I'm not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

Hi Mark,

To verify if the change has been successful after running the job, please login to SQL Server via SSMS and execute the following query against the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB:


























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes
You may also execute this on DB before executing the job and compare the results afterwards.

Have a great day!

Hi Pasan

I ran the FS_CreateSchema job in our test environment and its helped resolve our issues with the FSAA Import job.  The FSAA Import job now runs without any issue.  Thank you.
Reverting our focus to the original issue that lead us to running FS_MigrateSchema, did R & D give you any guidance on what we need to with the error we encountered?  Or do we ignore it?  As a reminder the error was:
13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
And before I ran S_MigrateSchema I asked Saqib whether there was another way to gauge its success, in case the job encountered some errors and he advised me to execute ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" from SQL Management Console.  The output is below:

I'm assuming this is what we expected?

Hi Pasan

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

[cid:image003.png@01DB3109.585C1CE0]

We don't use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log.

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information.

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please...

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn't impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: ""Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.""
I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

Response by early next week is highly unlikely with medium priority.

I have bump it up to high and I hope we'll get a response soon. Once I have an update, I'll reach out to you.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:




SELECT table_name



















































































































































































































































































































































FROM information_schema.tables



















































































































































































































































































































































WHERE table_type = 'base table';

Have a great day!

The Import job was working as I had temporarily unticked Update Statistics:

I ran the import job again and it worked without any errors.  Not sure what happened there as it had failed twice today already.  Will try again and report back.

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:

  1.  FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don't use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
  2.  When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error:
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

Hi team

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

I'm not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

Hi Mark,

To verify if the change has been successful after running the job, please login to SQL Server via SSMS and execute the following query against the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB:


























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes
You may also execute this on DB before executing the job and compare the results afterwards.

Have a great day!

Glad to hear FSAA issue has been fixed.

Since you are not using Sensitive data scanning you can safely ignore this error as the table ""SA_FSDLP_MatchHits"" contains sensitive data related contents. Please refer to this link  for more information about what each table contains.


Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi Pasan

 

I ran the FS_CreateSchema job in our test environment and its helped resolve our issues with the FSAA Import job.  The FSAA Import job now runs without any issue.  Thank you.

Reverting our focus to the original issue that lead us to running FS_MigrateSchema, did R & D give you any guidance on what we need to with the error we encountered?  Or do we ignore it?  As a reminder the error was:

13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

And before I ran S_MigrateSchema I asked Saqib whether there was another way to gauge its success, in case the job encountered some errors and he advised me to execute “sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes” from SQL Management Console.  The output is below:

 

I’m assuming this is what we expected?

Hi Mark,

I recommend you match the settings in Prod to Test environment and do the testing, so we know if any issues arise prior performing anything in Prod.

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

 

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

 



 

We don’t use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

 

Regards

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log. 

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information. 

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

 

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please…

 

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn’t impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

 

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: “Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.”

I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

I have escalated this ticket to R&D team to investigate this further and provide us a solution.

As the ticket is logged as medium severity, I have escalated it with the same. Please let me know if you need to bump up the severity.

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

 

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

 

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:


	FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don’t use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
	When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error: 


Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.

Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

 

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

 

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

 

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

Hi team

 

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

 

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

 

I’m not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

 

Regards

Hi Saqib

 

No I haven’t been able to do this yet.  I have a few days off in the next week so I plan to do our test environment on the 31st October and our production environment on 5th November.

Hi Mark,

Glad to hear FSAA issue has been fixed.

Since you are not using Sensitive data scanning you can safely ignore this error as the table ""SA_FSDLP_MatchHits"" contains sensitive data related contents. Please refer to this link <https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Data_Collectors/FileSystemAccess_Data_Collector/FileSystemAccess_Data_Collector.htm> for more information about what each table contains.


Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi Pasan

I ran the FS_CreateSchema job in our test environment and its helped resolve our issues with the FSAA Import job.  The FSAA Import job now runs without any issue.  Thank you.
Reverting our focus to the original issue that lead us to running FS_MigrateSchema, did R & D give you any guidance on what we need to with the error we encountered?  Or do we ignore it?  As a reminder the error was:
13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
And before I ran S_MigrateSchema I asked Saqib whether there was another way to gauge its success, in case the job encountered some errors and he advised me to execute ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" from SQL Management Console.  The output is below:

I'm assuming this is what we expected?

I recommend you match the settings in Prod to Test environment and do the testing, so we know if any issues arise prior performing anything in Prod.

Hi Pasan

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

[cid:image003.png@01DB3114.CDDA14D0]

We don't use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log.

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information.

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please...

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn't impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: ""Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.""
I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Response by early next week is highly unlikely with medium priority.

I have bump it up to high and I hope we'll get a response soon. Once I have an update, I'll reach out to you.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:




SELECT table_name



















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































FROM information_schema.tables



















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































WHERE table_type = 'base table';

Have a great day!

The Import job was working as I had temporarily unticked Update Statistics:

[cid:image004.png@01DB3114.CDDA14D0]

With this selected again the job fails.

I have uploaded logs to the call on the portal.

Password is the same as before.

Hi Saqib

I have uploaded the debug log for FS_MigrateSchema to the call in the portal.
I ran the import job again and it worked without any errors.  Not sure what happened there as it had failed twice today already.  Will try again and report back.

Hi Mark,

Thank you for sharing the information in detail. Can you please share the Debug logs for the jobs you have mentioned? I would like to discuss this with the product team before suggesting any solution.

Have a great day!

Hi Marti, seems Georges is off today.  Are you able to assist with organising a screenshare today regarding some issues I have encountered running FS_MigrateSchema?  This was a solution support provided to a problem with the FileSystemOverview report but its impacting my ability to import FSAA data to the DB.

Hey Pasan, would you have availability today?

Hi team

The FS_MigrateSchema job has finished running in my test environment and I am validating the functionality of the application and I am encountering some problems:

  1.  FS_MigrateSchema encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits.  Error message is ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""  It appears that 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' table is used by Sensitive Data which we don't use.  Is this going to impact anything else?  How can it be fixed?
  2.  When running an FSAA import job I encountered the following error:
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.
Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.

Why is this a problem and how can this be fixed?

Just to reiterate the context, I am running FS_MigrateSchema  to fix an issue with the FileSystemOverview in our production environment.  I am running this in test to see how environment reacts before running the same job in production.  Unless these issues can be fixed I will be unable to run this job in production which will impact the running of FileSystemOverview which we use to track our open shares.

The change window I am operating under expires tomorrow.  I have taken a backup of the DB, if we cannot fix these issues I will ask for the DB to be restored, does anything else need to be run to undo what FS_MigrateSchema has done?

Hi team

I am running the FS_MigrateSchema job in my test environment and so far it has successfully ran each task however, it has encountered an error with 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits,

The error message is:

Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

I'm not sure what FSDLP is, are you able to explain what that this table is used for and whether this is going to cause me a problem?

No I haven't been able to do this yet.  I have a few days off in the next week so I plan to do our test environment on the 31st October and our production environment on 5th November.

I'm unclear as to why you have been asked to run ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" specifically on this table because when File System Overview job runs, it refers to multiple tables instead of one.
Let me verify this with Alex and I get back to you tomorrow?

In the meantime, can you please run below command against the DB and share the results with me?

sp_help SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary

Hi Mark,

Glad to hear FSAA issue has been fixed.

Since you are not using Sensitive data scanning you can safely ignore this error as the table ""SA_FSDLP_MatchHits"" contains sensitive data related contents. Please refer to this link for more information about what each table contains.


Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi Pasan

 

I ran the FS_CreateSchema job in our test environment and its helped resolve our issues with the FSAA Import job.  The FSAA Import job now runs without any issue.  Thank you.

Reverting our focus to the original issue that lead us to running FS_MigrateSchema, did R & D give you any guidance on what we need to with the error we encountered?  Or do we ignore it?  As a reminder the error was:

13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

And before I ran S_MigrateSchema I asked Saqib whether there was another way to gauge its success, in case the job encountered some errors and he advised me to execute “sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes” from SQL Management Console.  The output is below:

 

I’m assuming this is what we expected?

Hi Mark,

I recommend you match the settings in Prod to Test environment and do the testing, so we know if any issues arise prior performing anything in Prod.

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

 

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

 



 

We don’t use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log. 

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information. 

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

 

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please…

 

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn’t impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

 

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: “Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.”

I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

Its been a long time, hope you’re doing well.

 

Ideally I’d like a solution early next week, are we likely to get that with medium severity?

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

I have escalated this ticket to R&D team to investigate this further and provide us a solution.

As the ticket is logged as medium severity, I have escalated it with the same. Please let me know if you need to bump up the severity.

Hi Saqib

 

Do you know what time zone this engineer is located in and an ETA on when I will be contacted?

 

I have run your command and uploaded the output to the portal.  Usual password will be needed to open it.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:

Hi Pasan

Yeah that's fine.

Basically I asked Saqib if there was a way we could tell if FS_MigrateSchema achieved the ultimate goal of updating int to bigint if FS_MigrateSchema errored, which it turned out it did.

Hi Mark,

I'm unclear as to why you have been asked to run ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" specifically on this table because when File System Overview job runs, it refers to multiple tables instead of one.
Let me verify this with Alex and I get back to you tomorrow?

In the meantime, can you please run below command against the DB and share the results with me?

sp_help SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary

Hi Mark,

Glad to hear FSAA issue has been fixed.

Since you are not using Sensitive data scanning you can safely ignore this error as the table ""SA_FSDLP_MatchHits"" contains sensitive data related contents. Please refer to this link <https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Data_Collectors/FileSystemAccess_Data_Collector/FileSystemAccess_Data_Collector.htm> for more information about what each table contains.


Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi Pasan

I ran the FS_CreateSchema job in our test environment and its helped resolve our issues with the FSAA Import job.  The FSAA Import job now runs without any issue.  Thank you.
Reverting our focus to the original issue that lead us to running FS_MigrateSchema, did R & D give you any guidance on what we need to with the error we encountered?  Or do we ignore it?  As a reminder the error was:
13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
And before I ran S_MigrateSchema I asked Saqib whether there was another way to gauge its success, in case the job encountered some errors and he advised me to execute ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" from SQL Management Console.  The output is below:

I'm assuming this is what we expected?

I recommend you match the settings in Prod to Test environment and do the testing, so we know if any issues arise prior performing anything in Prod.

Hi Pasan

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

[cid:image004.png@01DB3124.5F4CBD50]

We don't use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log.

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information.

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please...

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn't impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: ""Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.""
I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

Response by early next week is highly unlikely with medium priority.

I have bump it up to high and I hope we'll get a response soon. Once I have an update, I'll reach out to you.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:




SELECT table_name

WHERE table_type = 'base table';

Have a great day!

Good morning.

SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary details look good to me.

I'm yet to receive any response regarding your previous question and I don't expect the hear anything until later today.
Would you mind running the file system overview job in test environment and see if it completes fine?

Hi Pasan

 

Yeah that’s fine.

 

Basically I asked Saqib if there was a way we could tell if FS_MigrateSchema achieved the ultimate goal of updating int to bigint if FS_MigrateSchema errored, which it turned out it did.

Hi Mark,

I'm unclear as to why you have been asked to run ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" specifically on this table because when File System Overview job runs, it refers to multiple tables instead of one.
Let me verify this with Alex and I get back to you tomorrow?

In the meantime, can you please run below command against the DB and share the results with me?

sp_help SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary

Hi Mark,

Glad to hear FSAA issue has been fixed.

Since you are not using Sensitive data scanning you can safely ignore this error as the table ""SA_FSDLP_MatchHits"" contains sensitive data related contents. Please refer to this link for more information about what each table contains.


Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi Pasan

 

I ran the FS_CreateSchema job in our test environment and its helped resolve our issues with the FSAA Import job.  The FSAA Import job now runs without any issue.  Thank you.

Reverting our focus to the original issue that lead us to running FS_MigrateSchema, did R & D give you any guidance on what we need to with the error we encountered?  Or do we ignore it?  As a reminder the error was:

13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

And before I ran S_MigrateSchema I asked Saqib whether there was another way to gauge its success, in case the job encountered some errors and he advised me to execute “sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes” from SQL Management Console.  The output is below:

 

I’m assuming this is what we expected?

I recommend you match the settings in Prod to Test environment and do the testing, so we know if any issues arise prior performing anything in Prod.

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

 

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

 



 

We don’t use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log. 

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information. 

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

 

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please…

 

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn’t impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Mark,

Response by early next week is highly unlikely with medium priority.

I have bump it up to high and I hope we'll get a response soon. Once I have an update, I'll reach out to you.

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

I have escalated this ticket to R&D team to investigate this further and provide us a solution.

As the ticket is logged as medium severity, I have escalated it with the same. Please let me know if you need to bump up the severity.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:

Hi Mark,

Good morning.

SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary details look good to me.

I'm yet to receive any response regarding your previous question and I don't expect the hear anything until later today.
Would you mind running the file system overview job in test environment and see if it completes fine?

Hi Pasan

Yeah that's fine.

Basically I asked Saqib if there was a way we could tell if FS_MigrateSchema achieved the ultimate goal of updating int to bigint if FS_MigrateSchema errored, which it turned out it did.

Hi Mark,

I'm unclear as to why you have been asked to run ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" specifically on this table because when File System Overview job runs, it refers to multiple tables instead of one.
Let me verify this with Alex and I get back to you tomorrow?

In the meantime, can you please run below command against the DB and share the results with me?

sp_help SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary

Hi Mark,

Glad to hear FSAA issue has been fixed.

Since you are not using Sensitive data scanning you can safely ignore this error as the table ""SA_FSDLP_MatchHits"" contains sensitive data related contents. Please refer to this link <https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Data_Collectors/FileSystemAccess_Data_Collector/FileSystemAccess_Data_Collector.htm> for more information about what each table contains.


Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi Pasan

I ran the FS_CreateSchema job in our test environment and its helped resolve our issues with the FSAA Import job.  The FSAA Import job now runs without any issue.  Thank you.
Reverting our focus to the original issue that lead us to running FS_MigrateSchema, did R & D give you any guidance on what we need to with the error we encountered?  Or do we ignore it?  As a reminder the error was:
13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
And before I ran S_MigrateSchema I asked Saqib whether there was another way to gauge its success, in case the job encountered some errors and he advised me to execute ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" from SQL Management Console.  The output is below:

I'm assuming this is what we expected?

Hi Pasan

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

[cid:image004.png@01DB31BD.EF59EEB0]

We don't use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log.

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information.

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please...

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn't impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: ""Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.""
I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Its been a long time, hope you're doing well.

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

I have escalated this ticket to R&D team to investigate this further and provide us a solution.

Hi Mark,

Good morning.

SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary details look good to me.

I'm yet to receive any response regarding your previous question and I don't expect the hear anything until later today.
Would you mind running the file system overview job in test environment and see if it completes fine?

Hi Pasan

 

Yeah that’s fine.

 

Basically I asked Saqib if there was a way we could tell if FS_MigrateSchema achieved the ultimate goal of updating int to bigint if FS_MigrateSchema errored, which it turned out it did.

Hi Mark,

I'm unclear as to why you have been asked to run ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" specifically on this table because when File System Overview job runs, it refers to multiple tables instead of one.
Let me verify this with Alex and I get back to you tomorrow?

In the meantime, can you please run below command against the DB and share the results with me?

sp_help SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary

Hi Mark,

Glad to hear FSAA issue has been fixed.

Since you are not using Sensitive data scanning you can safely ignore this error as the table ""SA_FSDLP_MatchHits"" contains sensitive data related contents. Please refer to this link for more information about what each table contains.


Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi Pasan

 

I ran the FS_CreateSchema job in our test environment and its helped resolve our issues with the FSAA Import job.  The FSAA Import job now runs without any issue.  Thank you.

Reverting our focus to the original issue that lead us to running FS_MigrateSchema, did R & D give you any guidance on what we need to with the error we encountered?  Or do we ignore it?  As a reminder the error was:

13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

And before I ran S_MigrateSchema I asked Saqib whether there was another way to gauge its success, in case the job encountered some errors and he advised me to execute “sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes” from SQL Management Console.  The output is below:

 

I’m assuming this is what we expected?

Hi Mark,

I recommend you match the settings in Prod to Test environment and do the testing, so we know if any issues arise prior performing anything in Prod.

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

 

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

 



 

We don’t use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log. 

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information. 

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

 

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please…

 

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn’t impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

 

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: “Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.”

I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

I have escalated this ticket to R&D team to investigate this further and provide us a solution.

As the ticket is logged as medium severity, I have escalated it with the same. Please let me know if you need to bump up the severity.

Hi Saqib

 

Do you know what time zone this engineer is located in and an ETA on when I will be contacted?

 

I have run your command and uploaded the output to the portal.  Usual password will be needed to open it.

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:

Hey Pasan

Yeah I think we are all good now.

I will probably hold off performing the same change in production until the new year.  I will be taking leave over most of December and I don't want to impact the system and then take leave.

Hi Mark,

Good morning and apologies for the delay in getting back to you.

To clarify, sp_help is to understand the table structure in details and the screenshot you shared of SA_FSAA_FileTypes table is correct.


Please let me know if you have any other question regarding this or am I good to close the ticket?

Hi Mark,

Good morning.

SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary details look good to me.

I'm yet to receive any response regarding your previous question and I don't expect the hear anything until later today.
Would you mind running the file system overview job in test environment and see if it completes fine?

Hi Pasan

Yeah that's fine.

Basically I asked Saqib if there was a way we could tell if FS_MigrateSchema achieved the ultimate goal of updating int to bigint if FS_MigrateSchema errored, which it turned out it did.

Hi Mark,

I'm unclear as to why you have been asked to run ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" specifically on this table because when File System Overview job runs, it refers to multiple tables instead of one.
Let me verify this with Alex and I get back to you tomorrow?

In the meantime, can you please run below command against the DB and share the results with me?

sp_help SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary

Hi Mark,

Glad to hear FSAA issue has been fixed.

Since you are not using Sensitive data scanning you can safely ignore this error as the table ""SA_FSDLP_MatchHits"" contains sensitive data related contents. Please refer to this link <https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Data_Collectors/FileSystemAccess_Data_Collector/FileSystemAccess_Data_Collector.htm> for more information about what each table contains.


Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi Pasan

I ran the FS_CreateSchema job in our test environment and its helped resolve our issues with the FSAA Import job.  The FSAA Import job now runs without any issue.  Thank you.
Reverting our focus to the original issue that lead us to running FS_MigrateSchema, did R & D give you any guidance on what we need to with the error we encountered?  Or do we ignore it?  As a reminder the error was:
13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
And before I ran S_MigrateSchema I asked Saqib whether there was another way to gauge its success, in case the job encountered some errors and he advised me to execute ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" from SQL Management Console.  The output is below:

I'm assuming this is what we expected?

Hi Pasan

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

[cid:image004.png@01DB34F0.8310BFF0]

We don't use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log.

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information.

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please...

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn't impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: ""Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.""
After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: ""Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.""
I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hey Pasan

Its been a long time, hope you're doing well.

Ideally I'd like a solution early next week, are we likely to get that with medium severity?

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

I have escalated this ticket to R&D team to investigate this further and provide us a solution.

As the ticket is logged as medium severity, I have escalated it with the same. Please let me know if you need to bump up the severity.

Hi Saqib

Do you know what time zone this engineer is located in and an ETA on when I will be contacted?

I have run your command and uploaded the output to the portal.  Usual password will be needed to open it.

Hey Pasan

 

Yeah I think we are all good now.

 

I will probably hold off performing the same change in production until the new year.  I will be taking leave over most of December and I don’t want to impact the system and then take leave.

Hi Mark,

Good morning and apologies for the delay in getting back to you. 

To clarify, sp_help is to understand the table structure in details and the screenshot you shared of SA_FSAA_FileTypes table is correct. 


Please let me know if you have any other question regarding this or am I good to close the ticket?

Hi Mark,

Good morning.

SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary details look good to me.

I'm yet to receive any response regarding your previous question and I don't expect the hear anything until later today.
Would you mind running the file system overview job in test environment and see if it completes fine?

Hi Pasan

 

Yeah that’s fine.

 

Basically I asked Saqib if there was a way we could tell if FS_MigrateSchema achieved the ultimate goal of updating int to bigint if FS_MigrateSchema errored, which it turned out it did.

Hi Mark,

I'm unclear as to why you have been asked to run ""sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes"" specifically on this table because when File System Overview job runs, it refers to multiple tables instead of one.
Let me verify this with Alex and I get back to you tomorrow?

In the meantime, can you please run below command against the DB and share the results with me?

sp_help SA_FileSystemOverview_Report_Summary

Hi Mark,

Glad to hear FSAA issue has been fixed.

Since you are not using Sensitive data scanning you can safely ignore this error as the table ""SA_FSDLP_MatchHits"" contains sensitive data related contents. Please refer to this link for more information about what each table contains.


Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi Pasan

 

I ran the FS_CreateSchema job in our test environment and its helped resolve our issues with the FSAA Import job.  The FSAA Import job now runs without any issue.  Thank you.

Reverting our focus to the original issue that lead us to running FS_MigrateSchema, did R & D give you any guidance on what we need to with the error we encountered?  Or do we ignore it?  As a reminder the error was:

13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

And before I ran S_MigrateSchema I asked Saqib whether there was another way to gauge its success, in case the job encountered some errors and he advised me to execute “sp_help SA_FSAA_FileTypes” from SQL Management Console.  The output is below:

 

I’m assuming this is what we expected?

Hi Mark,

I recommend you match the settings in Prod to Test environment and do the testing, so we know if any issues arise prior performing anything in Prod.

Hi Pasan

 

Thanks for feedback.  I will raise a change and perform the task.

 

Thinking ahead to doing the same task in our production environment, the Create Schema job in test is configured as follows in test, but in prod the highlighted functions are unselected.

 



 

We don’t use the sensitive data features of the product.  Is it ok to leave them ticked in test or should I unselect them?

Hi Mark,

R&D team advised that rerunning the create schema job should fix the issues found in the bulk import log. 

As for the arithmetic overflow error in the FileSystemsOverview job, that should resolve itself once the updated schema is in use.

Can you please test this and let me know how you go in test environment?

Hi Mark,

I updated the escalation with this information. 

I believe this will impact the report as the error occurs when some value returns the result bigger than an INT can store. We will wait for the confrimatin from R&D team to bve certain.

Hey Pasan

 

Thanks for that.  Can we get a view from the R&D team around the following please…

 

If you recall the reason we ran FS_MigrateSchema is because we receive an error when we run the FileSystemOverview report in in production environment.  Would the error we receive result in an incomplete report?  Because if that error doesn’t impact the data report I would be tempted to avoid running FS_MigrateSchema in production.

 

Kind regards

Hi Mark,

Unfortunately, I'm yet to receive any response from R&D team.
When I escalate the issue, I have added the errors you mentioned in the recent email and ask them if these can be ignored and proceed forward.

As soon as I have an answer, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan

 

Just seeing if we have an update to our problem in our test environment post running FS_MigrateSchema?  As you recall the job encountered an error on 13.Migrate DLP MatchHits: “Could not drop object 'SA_FSDLP_MatchHits' because it is referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.”

After this everything is working as expected other than the FSAA Imports job where we see these errors: “Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_gatesproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_rightsproxyid_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_parentresourceid_name_idx'.  Cannot find index 'sa_fsaa_resources_enum_idx'.”

I had taken a backup of the DB before I ran FS_MigrateSchema so I need Netwrix to advise if I should restore the DB or whether we can work through this problem?

Hi Mark,

Response by early next week is highly unlikely with medium priority.

I have bump it up to high and I hope we'll get a response soon. Once I have an update, I'll reach out to you.

Hey Pasan

 

Its been a long time, hope you’re doing well.

 

Ideally I’d like a solution early next week, are we likely to get that with medium severity?

 

Regards

Hi Mark,

I hope you are doing well.

I have escalated this ticket to R&D team to investigate this further and provide us a solution.

As the ticket is logged as medium severity, I have escalated it with the same. Please let me know if you need to bump up the severity.

Hi Saqib

 

Do you know what time zone this engineer is located in and an ETA on when I will be contacted?

 

I have run your command and uploaded the output to the portal.  Usual password will be needed to open it.

 

Regards

Hi Mark,

I have discussed this case internally with the product team. To investigate further and resolve this issue, the case is being escalated to a senior engineer. Please expect a response from them.

Also, the product team has asked for a list of tables present inside the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor DB. Please execute the following SQL script when inside the NEA DB, save the results as a CSV file and share that file with us:
 



SELECT table_name","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #420763 -  - FileSystemOverview Error    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0Fehwr:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","mark.chambers@westpac.com.au","georges.chahwan@netwrix.com","pasan.illege@netwrix.com","true","2024-11-12T00:47:57.000Z","true"
