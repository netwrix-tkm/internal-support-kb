Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the FileSystemOverview job to see why the report was failing.
We were able to clean up the report.xml which removed the duplicate entries it was encountering and allowed the report to generate properly.

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved. The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Symptom
When running the FileSystemOverview job, the report generation fails with error ""Sequence contains more than one matching element""

Cause
Duplicate entries in the job and the report.xml lead to the report failing to populate because it could not determine which field was the correct one.

Resolution
We removed the entries in between <Reports> in the report.xml file for the job.
Once this was removed the report ran properly.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer
