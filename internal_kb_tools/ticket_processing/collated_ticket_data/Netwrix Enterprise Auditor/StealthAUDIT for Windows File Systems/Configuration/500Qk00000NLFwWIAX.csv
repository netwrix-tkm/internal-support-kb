We tried running Migrate Schema instant job to see if updating Data Types for File System solution related tables and views resolves this issue. 
But Migrate schema failed with these errors:

After this we tried running Repair maintenance task from FSAA System Scan query. We started repair for all active hosts. 
Repair took around 7 hours to complete and repair logs suggest that changes were made. 

Once repair has completed, we re-started Create Schema job and it now fails with slightly different errors:

The ALTER TABLE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint ""FK_SA_FSAC_ActivityEvents_PathID"". The conflict occurred in database ""StealthAUDIT"", table ""dbo.SA_FSAA_Resources"".

Column 'dbo.SA_FSAA_Resources.ID' is not the same data type as referencing column 'SA_FSAC_DailyActivity.FolderID' in foreign key 'FK_SA_FSAC_DailyActivity_FolderID'.
Could not create constraint or index. See previous errors.

We checked SA_FSAC_DailyActivity and SA_FSAC_ActivityEvents tables and noticed that both tables do not have any Foreign Keys, only Primary Keys are present. 
This can be seen on this screenshot:

The ActivityEvents and DailyActivity tables are in an invalid state.
Prior to upgrade/CreateSchema/MigrateSchema, these tables would have had a FK on the Hosts table. 
We can see this was not the case because there are hosts ids in these activity tables that are not in the Hosts table. 

To ensure there are not other problems, run:

SELECT HOST, ID
FROM SA_FSAA_Resources
WHERE HOST in (24, 25, 27);

This query returned nothing.","Waiting for next steps from R&D to progress with investifation.","Resolution
