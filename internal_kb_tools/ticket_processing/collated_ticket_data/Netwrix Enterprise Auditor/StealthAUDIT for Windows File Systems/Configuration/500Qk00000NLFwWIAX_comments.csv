Yeah it seems like we need MigrateSchema to succeed to get CreateSchema to succeed. But the migrations for the relevant tables have been stable for 8 years. So it doesn't make sense that 11.5 was working and now the migration is failing. There must be some other piece of information we haven't been provided.


	 - 	Before upgrading, were there any issues on 11.5?
	 - 	What were they on prior to 11.5 such that they did not have bigint types? (that's what MigrateSchema does)
	 - 	Have they manipulated data in any way? manually dropping T1/T2 data, repair tool, drop tables, remove host, etc...

It appears Host data was improperly dropped at some point

because when MigrateSchema tries to create the FK referencing the hosts table,
it fails indicating the ActivityEvents table has hosts not in the hosts table.
To verify run:

SELECT HOST FROM SA_FSAC_ActivityEvents
EXCEPT
SELECT ID FROM SA_FSAA_HOSTS;

Do the same for SA_FSAC_DailyActivity

The ActivityEvents and DailyActivity tables are in an invalid state.
Prior to upgrade/CreateSchema/MigrateSchema, these tables would have had a FK on the Hosts table. 
We can see this was not the case because there are hosts ids in these activity tables that are not in the Hosts table. 

To ensure there are not other problems, run:

SELECT HOST, ID
FROM SA_FSAA_Resources
WHERE HOST in (24, 25, 27);

If there are resources that reference these hosts, that would mean there are further problems with their T1 database.

Since the query did not provide any results, this confirms the activity events that are failing to migrate are invalid because they do not have resources to relate to. In order to correct the state of the SQL database, records that reference host 24, 25, and 27 should get removed.

Start with removing the records from SA_FSAC_ActivityEvents and SA_FSAC_DailyActivity with the follow SQL queries:

--- CODE ---DELETE FROM SA_FSAC_ActivityEvents
WHERE HOST IN (24, 25, 27)--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---
--- CODE ---

and


--- CODE ---
DELETE FROM SA_FSAC_DailyActivity
WHERE HOST IN (24, 25, 27)

--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---
--- CODE ---

Then try running Migrate Schema followed by Create Schema again. If the jobs continue to fail, please provided the new error message so that the remaining invalid records can be identified.

Please run the following query and provide the results:

--- CODE ---SELECT * FROM SA_FSAA_Hosts WHERE ID IN (24, 25, 27)--- CODE ---

Since those hosts have no resources, it should be safe to drop their data. If the query returns hosts that are recognized, you can configure a job to run the FSAA Remove Host query targeting the host names returned by the query. This will clear out all references to the above host IDs and will allow you to procede with the Migrate Schema and Create Schema jobs.

I've tried to look up table schema document, but I think I only have older one for AD and AIC tables.


On most recent meeting we were trying to determine hosts with customer and previously they had this output

The DELETE statement conflicted with the REFERENCE constraint ""FK_SA_FSAC_RenameTargets_ActivityID"". The conflict occurred in database ""StealthAUDIT"", table ""dbo.SA_FSAC_RenameTargets"".
The statement has been terminated.

for this query:

--- CODE ---

DELETE FROM SA_FSAC_ActivityEvents
WHERE HOST IN (24, 25, 27)--- CODE ---


--- CODE ---

Customer decided run a DELETE statement for SA_FSAC_RenameTargets

---CODE---

DELETE FROM SA_FSAC_RenameTargets
WHERE HOST IN (24, 25, 27)

---CODE---


This was not something we've recommended, customer did this on his own. After deleting from SA_FSAC_RenameTargets, this statement worked fine:

DELETE FROM SA_FSAC_ActivityEvents
WHERE HOST IN (24, 25, 27)

So we've decided to run Migrate Schema, and we still see the same error messages in Migrate Schema.

@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer 
We got on a call with the customer today and found that in addition to NAA SQL tables referencing hosts that have no data, there are also records that reference resources that do not exist in the SA_FSAA_Resources table. So I am working on putting together some SQL scripts to help remove the invalid data. We should schedule another call with the customer so we can address any subsequent issues after running the provided script as they come up until the database is in a valid state.

Here is the SQL script that will resolve the issues we saw on the call regarding SA_FSAC_ActivityEvents:

--- CODE ---DELETE ae

FROM SA_FSAC_ActivityEvents ae
LEFT JOIN SA_FSAA_Resources r
ON r.Host = ae.Host AND r.ID = ae.PathID
WHERE r.ID IS NULL
--- CODE ---

@Michael Burrofato @Luke Butcher @Chris Brooks @Salesforce
We need to run a similar query to the one I provided against the tables that SQL is throwing errors for. This can be done on the call scheduled tomorrow. We have a much better understanding of the underlying problem now.
