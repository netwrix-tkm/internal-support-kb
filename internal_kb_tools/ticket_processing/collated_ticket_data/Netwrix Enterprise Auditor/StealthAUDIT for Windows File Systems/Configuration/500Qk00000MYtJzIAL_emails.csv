Per our call today we again noted the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.240

We now see that the 0-FSDFS System Scans is completing successfully and we have the missing file server reporting under the needed Flexential job group.

It is not clear as to why updating the FSDFS job to look at a DC rather than a list of host corrected the issue.

We Confirmed that there is data for the missing server within the FSAA Tables as well as within the AIC.
I will close out this ticket as we noted.

We have 30days to reopen once the closure email is received.

To reopen we can just reply to that email to bring the case back into my queue.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. 

Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link.

Have a great weekend.

Again, thank You for your time.

It would take 24+ hours for all the jobs to complete that include this server.  I would like to take a look with someone before that time frame.  I have uploaded the existing logs from the last run with ERROR level.
