R&D notes that the applet server logs default to DEBUG, but even at the DEBUG level, they shouldn't be very large.

The log level for the FSAA_Applet_Server log is controlled by the NLog.config file in the FSAA folder for proxy servers installed as a service, and for automatic deployment, by the NLog.config file on the NEA server under *StealthAUDITPrivateAssembliesFILESYSTEMACCESSApplet.

On the Applet host under install path Example of Default ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAANLog.config""

To edit set the following as needed   options Error, Debug, Info, Warn
Would not recommend a limit lower than Error.
<rules>
<logger name=""*FSAA*"" minlevel=""Debug"" writeTo=""ServerFile"" />
<logger name=""*Kestrel*"" minlevel=""Info"" writeTo=""ServerFile"" />
<logger name=""*HttpsConnectionMiddleware*"" minlevel=""Debug"" writeTo=""ServerFile"" />
<logger name=""*"" minlevel=""Warn"" writeTo=""ServerFile"" />
</rules>
***RECOMMNED*** Use Notepad++ or similar simple code editor when making any changes.
