Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 
Here is a recap of what we did:

We made a new job and recreated settings of ""DropFSHostData"" custom job which was failing with ""Job connection profile is not available"" - all settings were correct except for the connection profile. 
The connection profile settings were set to default - and when we checked the corresponding ""Z_"" job group we noticed that the connection profile is empty.
We then switched it to an existing connection profile. 

At the moment I suspect that empty connection profile was a root cause of the ""DropFSHostData"" job failing with ""Job connection profile is not available"".
Please, let me know results once job completes since we made changes to settings and updated connection profile. 

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Hi Artem,

I’ve created the ""DropFSHostData"" custom job in my production server and have gone through the same steps we completed in the test environment.

Couple of things to note from this:

The host list from the analysis took a very long time to create a new host list from the data (I don’t know exactly, I left it to run overnight)
[cid:image001.png@01DBA253.F8D5FB80]

With there being 13k servers listed in the Host List, I decided to test the job on just two servers.

It ran for 5h 48m before being ‘Aborted’
[cid:image002.png@01DBA254.7C457180]

It did however remove the hosts from the FSAA_Hosts table in the ‘Results’
[cid:image003.png@01DBA254.FF7EBC50]

I’m just concerned that two servers took this long. If tried to all 13k it would take a very long time for the job to complete if it takes 2/3 hours per server.



Thanks,
Sean

Hi Artem,

The latest job for another two hosts just completed.

Unfortunately took another five hours
[cid:image001.png@01DBA327.2DB4D780]

But I noticed the Task Stats showed the hosts being removed within seconds of the job running
[cid:image002.png@01DBA327.2DB4D780]

And the FSAA_Hosts table updated very quickly after that to reflect the new number within it
[cid:image003.png@01DBA327.2DB4D780]

So not sure what may still be causing the job to runs for another 5 hours after when the analysis task is no longer enabled.

We can maybe look at it further?

Thanks,
Sean

Thank you for your reply.

To isolate which task causes job to run for 5 hours I need to analyze logs of the last job run.

Please, right-click on ""DropFSHostData"" job > select ""Export"" to export the logs folder.
Once exported, upload resulted archive to the ticket 00439897 using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section and notify me once upload has completed.

Hi Sean, 

Thank you for your time on a meeting today. 
Here is a recap of what we did:

We made a new job and recreated settings of ""DropFSHostData"" custom job which was failing with ""Job connection profile is not available"" - all settings were correct except for the connection profile. 
The connection profile settings were set to default - and when we checked the corresponding ""Z_"" job group we noticed that the connection profile is empty.
We then switched it to an existing connection profile. 

At the moment I suspect that empty connection profile was a root cause of the ""DropFSHostData"" job failing with ""Job connection profile is not available"".
Please, let me know results once job completes since we made changes to settings and updated connection profile. 

Looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Sean, 

This is Artem with a separate ticket for troubleshooting of ""Job connection profile is not available"" error message for ""DropFSHostData"" Job. 

The best way forward right now, I believe, would be scheduling a remote support session to review ""DropFSHostData"" Job configuration in test environment.

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your reply.

To isolate which task causes job to run for 5 hours I need to analyze logs of the last job run.

Please, right-click on ""DropFSHostData"" job > select ""Export"" to export the logs folder.
Once exported, upload resulted archive to the ticket 00439897 using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section and notify me once upload has completed.

Looking forward to your reply!

Hi Artem,

The latest job for another two hosts just completed.

Unfortunately took another five hours
[cid:image001.png@01DBA470.C33C4140]

But I noticed the Task Stats showed the hosts being removed within seconds of the job running
[cid:image002.png@01DBA470.C33C4140]

And the FSAA_Hosts table updated very quickly after that to reflect the new number within it
[cid:image003.png@01DBA470.C33C4140]

So not sure what may still be causing the job to runs for another 5 hours after when the analysis task is no longer enabled.

We can maybe look at it further?

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

The ""DropFSHostData"" job took 5 hours to complete when 2 hosts were selected for processing.
After inspecting the logs we found that most of the time was spent on completing FSAA_Hosts analysis task as it was taking a lot of time to resole 13k hosts.

There is no need to run this analysis task every time, as such we disabled it to check how long it will take to complete ""DropFSHostData"" without it.

Once you have results of the next run for a couple more hosts - please, let me know results.
I am looking forward to your reply.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NIqNu:ref


Hi Artem,

I've created the ""DropFSHostData"" custom job in my production server and have gone through the same steps we completed in the test environment.

Couple of things to note from this:

The host list from the analysis took a very long time to create a new host list from the data (I don't know exactly, I left it to run overnight)
[cid:image004.png@01DBA470.C33C4140]

With there being 13k servers listed in the Host List, I decided to test the job on just two servers.

It ran for 5h 48m before being 'Aborted'
[cid:image005.png@01DBA470.C33C4140]

It did however remove the hosts from the FSAA_Hosts table in the 'Results'
[cid:image006.png@01DBA470.C33C4140]

I'm just concerned that two servers took this long. If tried to all 13k it would take a very long time for the job to complete if it takes 2/3 hours per server.



Thanks,
Sean

Thank you for sharing these logs.

I took a closer look at the logs from my side and would like to share my findings.
I see that the job spent most of the time completing the following:

01/04/2025 05:57:13    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.GetNewADOConnection()    ""End""            25020    8632    14288
01/04/2025 10:47:16    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLHMStorageItf.UpdateHostListHosts    ""Start""        HostManagement    25020    8632    14288
01/04/2025 11:33:34    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLHMStorageItf.UpdateHostListHosts    ""End""        HostManagement    25020    8632    14288
01/04/2025 11:33:35    INFO    StealthAUDIT    TJobQueueThread.RunNextJob    ""FJob.Running:=FALSE""        DropFSHostData    13600    8632    14288
01/04/2025 11:33:35    INFO    SAJobEngine    TJobStatus.SetEvent    ""Completed in 5h:36m:33s""            13600    8632    14288

In this log we can see that job was waiting for 5 hours to start updating the host list ""hosts"" which is visible by the timestamps between these two lines:
01/04/2025 05:57:13    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.GetNewADOConnection()    ""End""            25020    8632    14288
01/04/2025 10:47:16    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLHMStorageItf.UpdateHostListHosts    ""Start""        HostManagement    25020    8632    14288

It seems that a job was waiting for SQL Server.
Could you clarify, were there any other jobs running in background while ""DropFSHostData"" job was running?

In any case, this delay is not related to the amount of data that job was removing. Job was not removing data for 2 hosts for 5 hours. The actual data removal process completed in less than a minute.

As such, I would suggest adding a complete list of Windows Hosts to the ""DropFSHostData"" job and let it run and complete data removal.
Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Artem

I ran another job this time with approx. 1000 hosts and the data was removed in about 12minutes with the FSAA_Hosts list updating to reflect this.

The job is still running doing something similar to your findings below, but I'll let It complete then move forward with the remaining hosts.
[cid:image001.png@01DBA4AF.9EE9B4F0]

Without any more issues, I'd be happy to have this ticket closed out as resolved if you're aligned?

Thanks,

In this log we can see that job was waiting for 5 hours to start updating the host list ""hosts"" which is visible by the timestamps between these two lines:
01/04/2025 05:57:13    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.GetNewADOConnection()    ""End""            25020    8632    14288

It seems that a job was waiting for SQL Server.
Could you clarify, were there any other jobs running in background while ""DropFSHostData"" job was running?

In any case, this delay is not related to the amount of data that job was removing. Job was not removing data for 2 hosts for 5 hours. The actual data removal process completed in less than a minute.

As such, I would suggest adding a complete list of Windows Hosts to the ""DropFSHostData"" job and let it run and complete data removal.
Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your reply.

To isolate which task causes job to run for 5 hours I need to analyze logs of the last job run.

Please, right-click on ""DropFSHostData"" job > select ""Export"" to export the logs folder.
Once exported, upload resulted archive to the ticket 00439897 using customer portal in ""My Tickets"" section and notify me once upload has completed.

Looking forward to your reply!

Hi Artem,

The latest job for another two hosts just completed.

Unfortunately took another five hours
[cid:image002.png@01DBA4AF.9EE9B4F0]

But I noticed the Task Stats showed the hosts being removed within seconds of the job running
[cid:image003.png@01DBA4AF.9EE9B4F0]

And the FSAA_Hosts table updated very quickly after that to reflect the new number within it
[cid:image004.png@01DBA4AF.9EE9B4F0]

So not sure what may still be causing the job to runs for another 5 hours after when the analysis task is no longer enabled.

We can maybe look at it further?

Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

The ""DropFSHostData"" job took 5 hours to complete when 2 hosts were selected for processing.
After inspecting the logs we found that most of the time was spent on completing FSAA_Hosts analysis task as it was taking a lot of time to resole 13k hosts.

There is no need to run this analysis task every time, as such we disabled it to check how long it will take to complete ""DropFSHostData"" without it.

Once you have results of the next run for a couple more hosts - please, let me know results.
I am looking forward to your reply.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NIqNu:ref


Hi Artem,

I've created the ""DropFSHostData"" custom job in my production server and have gone through the same steps we completed in the test environment.

Couple of things to note from this:

The host list from the analysis took a very long time to create a new host list from the data (I don't know exactly, I left it to run overnight)
[cid:image005.png@01DBA4AF.9EE9B4F0]

With there being 13k servers listed in the Host List, I decided to test the job on just two servers.

It ran for 5h 48m before being 'Aborted'
[cid:image006.png@01DBA4AF.9EE9B4F0]

It did however remove the hosts from the FSAA_Hosts table in the 'Results'
[cid:image007.png@01DBA4AF.9EE9B4F0]

I'm just concerned that two servers took this long. If tried to all 13k it would take a very long time for the job to complete if it takes 2/3 hours per server.



Thanks,
Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
Here is a recap of what we did:

We made a new job and recreated settings of ""DropFSHostData"" custom job which was failing with ""Job connection profile is not available"" - all settings were correct except for the connection profile.
The connection profile settings were set to default - and when we checked the corresponding ""Z_"" job group we noticed that the connection profile is empty.
We then switched it to an existing connection profile.

At the moment I suspect that empty connection profile was a root cause of the ""DropFSHostData"" job failing with ""Job connection profile is not available"".
Please, let me know results once job completes since we made changes to settings and updated connection profile.

Hello Sean,

This is Artem with a separate ticket for troubleshooting of ""Job connection profile is not available"" error message for ""DropFSHostData"" Job.

The best way forward right now, I believe, would be scheduling a remote support session to review ""DropFSHostData"" Job configuration in test environment.

Please, follow this link to schedule meeting with me:

Thank you for getting back to me with this update.
I can close this ticket then, but you can always re-open it if you feel like any related errors/issues return.

The following is a recap of the ticket for your records:

The ""DropFSHostData"" job was not starting.
After checking its settings we noticed that job had empty connection profile (no connection profile was selected).

Even though job is not scanning any data but removing it from NEA SQL db - it still needs connection profile to run.
We configured ""DropFSHostData"" job with one of the connection profilesin NEA, then we restarted job.

As of now the job is running and removing data.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return.
In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you!

Artem Naskal

Hi Artem

 

I ran another job this time with approx. 1000 hosts and the data was removed in about 12minutes with the FSAA_Hosts list updating to reflect this.

 

The job is still running doing something similar to your findings below, but I’ll let It complete then move forward with the remaining hosts.



 

Without any more issues, I’d be happy to have this ticket closed out as resolved if you’re aligned?

 


Thanks,

Sean

Hi Sean, 

Thank you for sharing these logs.

I took a closer look at the logs from my side and would like to share my findings.
I see that the job spent most of the time completing the following:

01/04/2025 05:57:13    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.GetNewADOConnection()    ""End""            25020    8632    14288
01/04/2025 10:47:16    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLHMStorageItf.UpdateHostListHosts    ""Start""        HostManagement    25020    8632    14288
01/04/2025 11:33:34    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLHMStorageItf.UpdateHostListHosts    ""End""        HostManagement    25020    8632    14288
01/04/2025 11:33:35    INFO    StealthAUDIT    TJobQueueThread.RunNextJob    ""FJob.Running:=FALSE""        DropFSHostData    13600    8632    14288
01/04/2025 11:33:35    INFO    SAJobEngine    TJobStatus.SetEvent    ""Completed in 5h:36m:33s""            13600    8632    14288

In this log we can see that job was waiting for 5 hours to start updating the host list ""hosts"" which is visible by the timestamps between these two lines:
01/04/2025 05:57:13    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLProfileConnectionItf.GetNewADOConnection()    ""End""            25020    8632    14288
01/04/2025 10:47:16    DEBUG    SQLSERVER    TSPSQLHMStorageItf.UpdateHostListHosts    ""Start""        HostManagement    25020    8632    14288

It seems that a job was waiting for SQL Server.
Could you clarify, were there any other jobs running in background while ""DropFSHostData"" job was running?

In any case, this delay is not related to the amount of data that job was removing. Job was not removing data for 2 hosts for 5 hours. The actual data removal process completed in less than a minute.
