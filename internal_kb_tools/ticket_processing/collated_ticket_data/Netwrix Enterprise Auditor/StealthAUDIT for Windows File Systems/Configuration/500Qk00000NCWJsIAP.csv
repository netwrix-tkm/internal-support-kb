"500Qk00000NCWJsIAP","00439695","Support Ticket","Configure NEA After File Server Change","Hello!  We are replacing 2 DFS file servers named SAN01 and SAN02 with one file server named NAS01.  Scottie helped me recently in ticket 436992, and I used the KB links he provided to remove NAM agents for SAN01 and SAN02, and add and configure the agent for NAS01.

Now I'd like assistance with configuring NEA.  I might be able to make the appropriate changes, but I'm unsure, in particular with the DFS configuration.  Could you please send me a link to schedule a session to make the changes.

If software updates are available, it would also be good to upgrade.  Our last upgrade was Nov. 23'.  We are running AIC 11.6.0.3, NAM 7.0.2987, and NEA 11.6.0.42.","NA - Customer requesting assistance configuring DFS scanning with new servers.","--------

Customer needs assistance removing old DFS servers and replacing them with single new NAS server.","Awaiting meeting.","Symptom

Assistance replacing DFS servers with new NAS01 server in Enterprise Auditor.





Resolution

Reconfigured your FileServer list to scan only the NAS01 server and removed the SAN01 and SAN02 servers.

We validated that your jobs were setup to run against the new server.

We ran test FSAA and FSAC jobs and validated that they connection to the server worked and that data was imported.

We validated that AIC sees the new server and can see the new data that was scanned.","Guidance","Ian Ranstrom","Request","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Configuration","11.6","","10.0","Closed - Resolved","Oregon Social Learning Center","Mike Kinner","2025-03-21T22:36:03.000Z","2025-03-31T21:48:32.000Z"
