Under the FSAM options > There is a checkbox for ""Retry failed rows"".

There is a little box that says ""Do not retry error codes"", how do we obtain the specific error codes for FSAM to acknowledge so it doesn't retry the row?

For example, if the path is not reachable, instead of showing ""RPC error"" in the logs, i'd like to set it up so that it sees the error code and SKIPS the row and continues onto the next.

thank you","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-05T22:19:06.000Z"
