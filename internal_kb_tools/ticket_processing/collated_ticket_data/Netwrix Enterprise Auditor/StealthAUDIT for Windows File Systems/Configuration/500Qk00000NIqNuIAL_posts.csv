The ""DropFSHostData"" job had empty connection profile (no connection profile was selected). 
Even though job is not scanning any data but removing it from NEA SQL db - it still needs connection profile to run. 
We configured ""DropFSHostData"" job with one of the connection profiles they had in NEA, then we restarted job.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-03-26T13:26:29.000Z"

Customer replied that ""DropFSHostData"" job now runs successfully, but it took 5+ hours to complete for 2 hosts. 

Checked the logs - most of the time job spent on performing analysis task ""FSAA _hosts"". (this task does select statement from FSAA_Hosts table).
In case of this customer - they have 13K+ hosts.

Suggested disabling this analysis task, then check how long job will take without it.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-04-01T10:00:17.000Z"
