Thank you for your time on the meeting yesterday.

You expressed concern that you were unable to collect file permissions from a host. On review of this we determined that this new host was missing the required permissions from the documentation:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/Configuration/Windows_Config/SA_FS_Scan_(Windows).htm

We have previously been through the same checks for other connection profiles and service accounts, all of which require the permissions setup to be able to scan.

I created a new ticket to track this as it is important we are able to record all the occurrences raised. 

The previous ticket 402754 will be closed as we had resolved the issue regarding the  Access denied. (This was due to using the wrong account to scan a host in a different Doman and continues to be resolved since this was configured correctly).

Once you have setup the Global account access to the DEACMICS-APP01 target host you will be able to scan successfully.

Please make sure this is configured and let me know the results.

Best regards,

Alex Buchta

As previously stated you should make sure communication goes through the relevant support ticket. This ticket will be used to troubleshoot and discuss access to the hosts which we met about on 18th June.


""Is it possible to replace the local admin account with the backup operator account for conducting the scan? Our customer prefers not to utilize local accounts for scanning. During our testing, we encountered access denied errors message after switching to the backup operator account. Could you advise on avoiding the use of local accounts and implementing the backup operator account instead? Additionally, after switching to the backup operator account, shall we ignore access denied error message ? Please confirm. For your reference, We have Attached Gabor communication mail with Netwrix regarding this access issue.""

Yes this is possible and is in the referenced document in the email I sent below from 19th June

Dear Saveetha, I wanted to follow up because I have not heard from you since my last email. May I ask what the current status of the issue is? Did the previous email that I sent answer your questions and resolve your issues? Please let me know
