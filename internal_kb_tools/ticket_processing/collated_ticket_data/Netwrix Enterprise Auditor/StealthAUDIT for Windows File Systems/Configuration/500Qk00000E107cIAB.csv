"500Qk00000E107cIAB","00417053","Support Ticket","Remove/Revert Instant Job","Inadvertently added instant job (don't recall which), but need to remove it. I've tried to remove the jobs manually, but they seem to be interspersed. Can I restore C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs from a previous day and repair to remove the added jobs?","","","","Looked at the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)   11.5.0.260

Removed the duplicate Job Group C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobsGROUP_FileSystemGROUP_0.CollectionGROUP_1.PermissionsGROUP_FileSystem

After comparing with the jobs from the backup C:RestoreJobsGROUP_FileSystem

We removed the File System Activity (FSAC) related jobs from the console by renaming them the thew BU_ (bakup) to leave anything that had been collected from being removed from the SQL DB.

Found a few other oddities with the configuration that we might want to have sales set up a Health Check to confirm we are collecting the needed data.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Configuration","11.5","206","2.2","Closed - Resolved","W.
