It was not detecting it on 2 servers, but we got 1 of the servers functioning. 

Initial error:
Error during processing:  GetFSACIniAttributeValueC:ProgramDataNetwrixActivity MonitorAgentSBTFileMon.ini does not exist.

Verified on call that NAM is configured correctly. And events are searchable in NAM. 

The 2 servers do not have a lot of activity. 
1. Updated both hosts in NEA, initially they were showing as Offline and no server fingerprint information, but that populated correctly after host update performed. 
2. Remotely accessed server's INI file location from NEA server, verified content of INI file correct for setup and server name matches NEA server name. 
3. Created activity on both servers, and 1 of the servers began functioning correctly.

Backstory: Servers were offline for some time due to network outage. Both servers had been removed from NEA. They were brought online, with no major changes done to them during downtime. Prior to our call the agents for NAM, were removed and reinstalled.","","","","0054u000006goKrAAI","2025-05-09T19:02:08.000Z"

We only want to adjust the STEALTHAUDIT value for [FILE_MONITOR1] because there is no log file location associated. I&#39;m not sure why this would have occurred, as there&#39;s no option for StealthAUDIT on Syslog outputs, but if this doesn&#39;t correct the issue, then I&#39;ll open an escalation.</p>","","","","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2025-05-15T18:02:54.000Z"
