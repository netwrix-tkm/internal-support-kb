"500Qk00000Hvli4IAB","00426137","Support Ticket","File System Action Module - retry failed rows - error codes","Hello,

Under the FSAM options > There is a checkbox for ""Retry failed rows"".

There is a little box that says ""Do not retry error codes"", how do we obtain the specific error codes for FSAM to acknowledge so it doesn't retry the row?

For example, if the path is not reachable, instead of showing ""RPC error"" in the logs, i'd like to set it up so that it sees the error code and SKIPS the row and continues onto the next.

Thanks! So if I’m receiving this below error code 0x80004005, then the error code to put into SA “do not retry” would be 4005?
