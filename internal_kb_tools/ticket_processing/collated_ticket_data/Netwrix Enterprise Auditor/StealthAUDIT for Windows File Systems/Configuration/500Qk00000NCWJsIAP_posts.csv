We are replacing 2 DFS file servers named SAN01 and SAN02 with one file server named NAS01.  Scottie helped me recently in ticket 436992, and I used the KB links he provided to remove NAM agents for SAN01 and SAN02, and add and configure the agent for NAS01.

Now I'd like assistance with configuring NEA.  I might be able to make the appropriate changes, but I'm unsure, in particular with the DFS configuration.  Could you please send me a link to schedule a session to make the changes.

If software updates are available, it would also be good to upgrade.  Our last upgrade was Nov. 23'.  We are running AIC 11.6.0.3, NAM 7.0.2987, and NEA 11.6.0.42.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-21T22:36:04.000Z"
