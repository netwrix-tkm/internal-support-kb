I have found some internal documentation which references Microsoft System Error codes.

Do you think it would be helpful if we met to discuss this?

Hello Michael,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00426137. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00426137
Ticket Subject: File System Action Module - retry failed rows - error codes
Ticket Details: Hello,

Under the FSAM options > There is a checkbox for ""Retry failed rows"".

There is a little box that says ""Do not retry error codes"", how do we obtain the specific error codes for FSAM to acknowledge so it doesn't retry the row?

For example, if the path is not reachable, instead of showing ""RPC error"" in the logs, i'd like to set it up so that it sees the error code and SKIPS the row and continues onto the next.

thank you

Thank you!

Hi,

Thanks! So if I’m receiving this below error code 0x80004005, then the error code to put into SA “do not retry” would be 4005?

Hello Michael,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00426137. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00426137
Ticket Subject: File System Action Module - retry failed rows - error codes
Ticket Details: Hello,

Under the FSAM options > There is a checkbox for ""Retry failed rows"".

There is a little box that says ""Do not retry error codes"", how do we obtain the specific error codes for FSAM to acknowledge so it doesn't retry the row?

For example, if the path is not reachable, instead of showing ""RPC error"" in the logs, i'd like to set it up so that it sees the error code and SKIPS the row and continues onto the next.

thank you

Thank you!
