We seem to be getting the follow error when running the bulk import on our sensitive data scan. Error: DLPEX database does not exist, there is no data to import.

I have looked the help articles and admin guides but I don't seem to see anything regarding this error.

Thanks Adam.","","","","Found outdated System.Data.SQLite.dll library version 1.0.112.0 in C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA folder after the upgrade.
