Yes please.  I was told by another tech that something can be done with them. We have messages that appear as errors, but the location doesn’t exist and will never exist. When we see the job run, it results in ERROR because of these.  It’s time consuming going through each one and seeing the same error messages every time. If not omit the error, can we exclude the location from being scanned?

Sure.  Here is a screenshot of one of the messages:
[cid:image001.png@01DBAE0D.4D21A4E0]

The location of \DRF-ERNIE2stsyssa012 will never exist. Stsyssa012 is the service account we use for Netwrix and for some reason, it’s looking for that path, which does not exist. I would like to either omit this entire message from appearing, or exclude this location so that way if it doesn’t scan it, the error shouldn’t show up. This is from our sensitive data scan.

You can exclude the directories that are giving you problems like this in the FSAA. FSAC. amd SEEK system scans.
To do this, open the job and navigate to configuration and select the query. From the right pane double click on the query and you will see the query properties open.



Once you have the query properties open, select configure and from the Data Collector wizard navigate to scoping options and select Add



From the scoping options window you will add the resource name and host name and select either share or folder exclude from the drop down.
The screenshot below would be an example of how you would exclude the share that is casing the error you provided to me.



Below is the full documentation on the SEEK scan options, if you have any questions please let me know and I'd be happy to assist.

Yes please.  I was told by another tech that something can be done with them. We have messages that appear as errors, but the location doesn’t exist and will never exist. When we see the job run, it results in ERROR because of these.  It’s time consuming going through each one and seeing the same error messages every time. If not omit the error, can we exclude the location from being scanned?

Hello Steven,

You can exclude the directories that are giving you problems like this in the FSAA. FSAC. amd SEEK system scans.
To do this, open the job and navigate to configuration and select the query. From the right pane double click on the query and you will see the query properties open.



Once you have the query properties open, select configure and from the Data Collector wizard navigate to scoping options and select Add



From the scoping options window you will add the resource name and host name and select either share or folder exclude from the drop down.
The screenshot below would be an example of how you would exclude the share that is casing the error you provided to me.



Below is the full documentation on the SEEK scan options, if you have any questions please let me know and I'd be happy to assist.

Sure.  Here is a screenshot of one of the messages: 



 

The location of \DRF-ERNIE2stsyssa012 will never exist. Stsyssa012 is the service account we use for Netwrix and for some reason, it’s looking for that path, which does not exist. I would like to either omit this entire message from appearing, or exclude this location so that way if it doesn’t scan it, the error shouldn’t show up. This is from our sensitive data scan.

Hello Steven,

I may not be understanding, can you tell me what job is giving you the errors? It may be possible to exclude the locations so they no longer get scanned if this is a collection job of some sort.
Can you also provide a screenshot of the errors you are seeing that you want to get rid of?

Thank you,

Yes they have. Thank you. It appears to be folders that are deleted, but are still showing up in the Netwrix database. Excluding the shares will work until I can figure out where they need to be deleted.

Hello Steven,

You can exclude the directories that are giving you problems like this in the FSAA. FSAC. amd SEEK system scans.
To do this, open the job and navigate to configuration and select the query. From the right pane double click on the query and you will see the query properties open.

[cid:image002.png@01DBB04A.FEBE8990]

Once you have the query properties open, select configure and from the Data Collector wizard navigate to scoping options and select Add

[cid:image003.png@01DBB04A.FEBE8990]

From the scoping options window you will add the resource name and host name and select either share or folder exclude from the drop down.
The screenshot below would be an example of how you would exclude the share that is casing the error you provided to me.

[cid:image004.png@01DBB04A.FEBE8990]

Below is the full documentation on the SEEK scan options, if you have any questions please let me know and I'd be happy to assist.

Sure.  Here is a screenshot of one of the messages:
[cid:image005.png@01DBB04A.FEBE8990]

The location of \DRF-ERNIE2stsyssa012 will never exist. Stsyssa012 is the service account we use for Netwrix and for some reason, it’s looking for that path, which does not exist. I would like to either omit this entire message from appearing, or exclude this location so that way if it doesn’t scan it, the error shouldn’t show up. This is from our sensitive data scan.

Hello Steven,

I may not be understanding, can you tell me what job is giving you the errors? It may be possible to exclude the locations so they no longer get scanned if this is a collection job of some sort.
Can you also provide a screenshot of the errors you are seeing that you want to get rid of?

Thank you,

Yes please.  I was told by another tech that something can be done with them. We have messages that appear as errors, but the location doesn’t exist and will never exist. When we see the job run, it results in ERROR because of these.  It’s time consuming going through each one and seeing the same error messages every time. If not omit the error, can we exclude the location from being scanned?

Yes they have. Thank you. It appears to be folders that are deleted, but are still showing up in the Netwrix database. Excluding the shares will work until I can figure out where they need to be deleted.

Hello Steven,

You can exclude the directories that are giving you problems like this in the FSAA. FSAC. amd SEEK system scans.
To do this, open the job and navigate to configuration and select the query. From the right pane double click on the query and you will see the query properties open.

[cid:image002.png@01DBB04E.941392D0]

Once you have the query properties open, select configure and from the Data Collector wizard navigate to scoping options and select Add

[cid:image003.png@01DBB04E.941392D0]

From the scoping options window you will add the resource name and host name and select either share or folder exclude from the drop down.
The screenshot below would be an example of how you would exclude the share that is casing the error you provided to me.

[cid:image004.png@01DBB04E.941392D0]

Below is the full documentation on the SEEK scan options, if you have any questions please let me know and I'd be happy to assist.

Sure.  Here is a screenshot of one of the messages:
[cid:image005.png@01DBB04E.941392D0]

The location of \DRF-ERNIE2stsyssa012 will never exist. Stsyssa012 is the service account we use for Netwrix and for some reason, it’s looking for that path, which does not exist. I would like to either omit this entire message from appearing, or exclude this location so that way if it doesn’t scan it, the error shouldn’t show up. This is from our sensitive data scan.

Hello Steven,

I may not be understanding, can you tell me what job is giving you the errors? It may be possible to exclude the locations so they no longer get scanned if this is a collection job of some sort.
Can you also provide a screenshot of the errors you are seeing that you want to get rid of?

Thank you,

Yes please.  I was told by another tech that something can be done with them. We have messages that appear as errors, but the location doesn’t exist and will never exist. When we see the job run, it results in ERROR because of these.  It’s time consuming going through each one and seeing the same error messages every time. If not omit the error, can we exclude the location from being scanned?

Yes they have. Thank you. It appears to be folders that are deleted, but are still showing up in the Netwrix database. Excluding the shares will work until I can figure out where they need to be deleted.
