@Chris Brooks @Michael Burrofato @Salesforce@WaitingOnEngineer
I have found that the reason the DLPEX database was causing the error is because it contained folder and file id combinations that do not exist in the resources table. There is a scan (SDD USN 37) that was paused and resumed. The matches collected on the resumed scan map to resources in the resources table, but matches in the paused scan have several matches that do not map to resources in the resources table. 

I would like to investigate the logs of the paused scan, but they are not included in the logs provided because we do not copy logs from the proxy when scans are aborted. So in order to get the applet log for the aborted scan, it will have to be retrieved from the proxy. 

Please navigate to the proxy host's FSAAESIFNPWP01.ESI.US.EISAI.LOCAL folder and retrieve the log with the name ""SDD_ESIFNPWP01.ESI.US.EISAI.LOCAL_2025_02_13_*_c295487b-bf58-47d1-9b80-e2e2086e7996_0.log"" (the * in the log name will be a 9 digit number that should start with ""1917"" as the first 4 digits). There should only be one log file with this exact name but if there are multiple logs that match this pattern on the proxy please provide them as well.

Is the customer still operating normally after generating a new DLPEx database?

@Salesforce, We reviewed the latest applet logs uploaded on the 7th. Then, as far as we're aware, the scan worked, and we could not reproduce the issue or come up with a better path forward at this time. We are waiting to see if the scan has the same problem since it takes weeks to complete. @WaitingOnEngineer
