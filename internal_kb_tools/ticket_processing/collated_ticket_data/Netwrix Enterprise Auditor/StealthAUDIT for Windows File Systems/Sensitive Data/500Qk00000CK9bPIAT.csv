Is it possible to apply tags to files found by a sensitive data scan without changing the file's date and timestamp and preserving last access date and timestamp and only files in a certain folder?","","","","Noted I do not believe so as the Tag would be a modification to the File system object. 

Devâ€™s reply: Correct access and modification times will change.
This is by design, because modifying the contents of a file while preserving its timestamps may break certain applications and cause data corruption.","Guidance","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Sensitive Data","11.5","231","1.0","Closed - Resolved","Assystem Energy & Infrastructure Limited","James Allen","2024-06-26T14:51:11.000Z","2024-06-27T15:33:09.000Z"
