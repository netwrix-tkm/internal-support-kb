Dev reviewed the applet logs, but have not been able to reproduce the issue or come up with a better plan forward. It is my understanding that their SEEK scans take a weeks, any eta on when the next scan is expected to be complete so we can verify if the issue is truly resolved?

Thank you,

Just checking in on this as I understand the issue has not re-appeared. Has the scan completed? If not, do we have an eta on when the scan will finish? Do you feel this issue is resolved and this can be closed with the potential to re-open if anything else comes up?

Thank you,
