Here's an issue reported by Ardentec,[Ardentec] The field ""filepath"" of  Share with Sensitive Contenct showing nothing at all as attached screenshot.
Please assist in clarifying it and make it clear.

Jimmy","Step 1: Navigate to File System Job Group and run 0.Collection and SEEK job (collects Sensitive Data). 
Step 2: View FileSystem Solution -> 0.Collection -> 0-Collection-> FSDLP_Matchesview
Step 3: Navigate to 7.Sensitive Data and then execute the FS_DLPResults and view reports.","The customer has upgraded to v.11.6.125 and afterwards ran the SEEK job (sensitive data discovery job) for file systems. However, for some of the entries in the reports, they dont see any data for the file path being scanned. This is a known bug for files that have exceptions like being password protected and has been resolved in v.11.6.127 and v.11.6.132.

Customer has upgraded to 11.6.0.130.
As per latest update and screenshot image, they are able to see data in FileSystem Solution -> 0.Collection -> 0-Collection-> FSDLP_Matchesview but not in 7.Sensitive Data reports. This is reproducible in my lab.
