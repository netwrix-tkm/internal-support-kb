"500Qk00000O5DQEIA3","00442164","Support Ticket","Omit errors from scan jobs","On some of our scan jobs, we have messages that are always shown as ERROR, yet they are known and are not technically errors. Is there a way to either stop logging specific errors into the SA_Message table or categorize these errors as warnings? Would make it easier to see scan results. Even if there is one error, job shows as ERROR.","","","","Issue:
Scan jobs are throwing errors on file system objects that errors are expected on. Need to filter these objects to clear the errors.


Resolution:
Added exclusions to the objects that are expected to error using scoping option documentation.
