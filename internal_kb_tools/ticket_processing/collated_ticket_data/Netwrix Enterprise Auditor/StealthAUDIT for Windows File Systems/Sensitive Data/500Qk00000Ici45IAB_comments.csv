@Salesforce @Chris Brooks @Ethan Israel @Matthew Finnegan Can we get the FSAA Applet logs, SDD ScannerLib logs and SDD Extractor logs created for the problemeatic host. All of these should be located in the FSAAHOST folder. If possible, please provide the tier 2 databases as well. But at the very least we will need the logs to see what's going wrong with the collection.

@Salesforce any update from the customer on the requested logs? The ticket in SF seems to be set to Awaiting R&D, which appear to be wrong.

@Salesforce The issue isn't clear from the logs provided as they show sensitive data collected. Could we get the latest FSAA and SEEK job folders with their entire log structures? If either is too large, could you screenshot the structures so we can advise which items can be omitted from the collection?
Thank you!

@Chris Brooks @Michael Burrofato @Helen Randall @WaitingOnEngineer@Salesforce
After looking at the logs and tier 2 databases provided it does not look like collection is successful at all, all the DLP databases for PSFS01 are empty. The logs also indicate that the scan is abruptly terminating. During the scan is there a spike in CPU and/or memory usage on the proxy? When confirming that collection worked against the local host was this a local or proxy mode scan targeting the local host?

I need a bit more clarity on how collection was verified by running against the localhost. Was the local mode scan only used when targeting the localhost, or was PSFS01 targeted using local mode scans? If PSFS01 used both local and remote scans, did the local mode scan succeed?

Remote scanning uses the target host as a proxy if the target host is a Windows server, so if local mode scans are succeeding and remote scans are failing it would indicate that the problem is on the execution host. The logs indicate the FSAAScanHost.exe is being terminated during the scan, so I am trying to determine if the issue is specific to the execution host or if this issue is present regardless of the execution host.

I would also like to know if there is any endpoint security software in the customer's environment that could be killing FSAAScanHost.exe, because this has been the cause for issues in the past with similar symptoms.

We have seen evidence of the scan abruptly ending. We asked and did not receive any indication if there were sudden resource spikes around this time.

We have been unable to to identify any indication of malfuction except for this abrupt ending which may be cause by any number of external factors.

The customer has been directed to upgrade to take advantage of a fix which was published in December 2024 for the Senstive Data add-on where resource consumption would grow unexpected and the scan would produce an out of memory or similar errors then crash. 

NEA 11.6.0.125 and SDD 11.6.0.14. We would need to know the most recent build of NEA nad the SDD Add-on to determine that this fix is implemented.","0050g000006QqyEAAS","2025-04-03T14:36:19.000Z","2025-04-03T14:36:19.000Z","false","false"
