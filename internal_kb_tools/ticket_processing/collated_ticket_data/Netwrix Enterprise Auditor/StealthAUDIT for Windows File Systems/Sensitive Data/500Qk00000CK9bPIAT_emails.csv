Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 
#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")

To the question at hand, I do not believe so as the Tag would be a modification to the File system object.

I will however confirm with Dev.
 
Please also confirm your correct email address I show the following:

Essentially, we are trying to use the sensitive data scan results to tag files depending what the criteria find.  So thatâ€™s one thing weâ€™ve not done before -  tagging in an action module -  and so we are cautious!  We do not want to mess up files and crucially do not want to alter the timestamps of files which will then mess up the stale file jobs we run to highlight where data is not being used.

Always happy to help!

Devâ€™s reply: Correct access and modification times will change.
This is by design, because modifying the contents of a file while preserving its timestamps may break certain applications and cause data corruption.

I'm not sure there is any method to mod a file object that will not change those attributes.

I will close out this ticket for us.

We have 30days to reopen once the closure email is received.

To reopen we can just reply to that email to bring the case back into my queue.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. 

Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link.

Have a great weekend.

Again, thank You for your time.

Essentially, we are trying to use the sensitive data scan results to tag files depending what the criteria find.  So thatâ€™s one thing weâ€™ve not done before -  tagging in an action module -  and so we are cautious!  We do not want to mess up files and crucially do not want to alter the timestamps of files which will then mess up the stale file jobs we run to highlight where data is not being used.

 

My primary email address is now  jaallen-ext@assystem.com  but the other one still works.

 

Thanks

 

James

James,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 
#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")

To the question at hand, I do not believe so as the Tag would be a modification to the File system object.

I will however confirm with Dev.
 
Please also confirm your correct email address I show the following:
jaallen@assystem.com
jaallen-ext@assystem.com

Thank You for your time.
