@Helen Randall @Ethan Israel @Chris Brooks @Matthew Finnegan @Salesforce 

Considering there are no logs or artifacts, I doubt there's much triage we can do here.

I will say that the behavior being sounds similar to the issues happening in #327058, particularly the bug fix in #343572 

We issued a couple fixes already for that escalation and considering that this customer is on an older version that does not have them, I recommend upgrading them to the latest available CU, and if issue persists, they should provide artifacts such as job logs and application logs.
