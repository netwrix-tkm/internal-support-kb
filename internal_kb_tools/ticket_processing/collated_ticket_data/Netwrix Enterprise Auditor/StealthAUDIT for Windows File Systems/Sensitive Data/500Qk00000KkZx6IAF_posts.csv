The data should contain some exceptions like password protected or without read rights etc.
Step 2: View the results tab and it will not display the path of those files.","","","","005Qk00000214EvIAI","2025-02-06T00:26:35.000Z"

As per latest update and screenshot image, they are able to see data in FileSystem Solution -> 0.Collection -> 0-Collection-> FSDLP_Matchesview but not in 7.Sensitive Data reports. This is reproducible in my lab.
