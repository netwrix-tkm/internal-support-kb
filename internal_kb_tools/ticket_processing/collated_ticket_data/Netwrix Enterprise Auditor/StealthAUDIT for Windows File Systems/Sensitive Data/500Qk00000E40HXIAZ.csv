I have recently upgraded to v11.6  and since the upgrade my Sensitive Data job has not run.
The first error Is saw was:  <a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA</a>.FSAAException: Tier 1 database schema is not up to date, run the Create Schema job
   at <a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA</a>.AccessScanTask.d__2.MoveNext()
--- End of stack trace from previous location where exception was thrown ---

   at <a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Tasks.Task</a>.StartExecute()

Having run the create schema job,  I now get this error and the job does not complete:  Error during processing:  Could not load file or assembly '<a href='https://System.Data' target='_blank'>System.Data</a>.SQLite, Version=1.0.117.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)

Please can you advise","","","","Outdated System.Data.SQLite.dll library version 1.0.112.0 in C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA folder after the upgrade.

Replaced with System.Data.SQLite.dll version 1.0.117.0 from any other folder in NEA and now the scan works fine.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Aleksandr Timofeev","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Sensitive Data","11.6","","6.1","Closed - Resolved","Assystem Energy & Infrastructure Limited","James Allen","2024-08-06T07:55:35.000Z","2024-08-12T09:43:58.000Z"
