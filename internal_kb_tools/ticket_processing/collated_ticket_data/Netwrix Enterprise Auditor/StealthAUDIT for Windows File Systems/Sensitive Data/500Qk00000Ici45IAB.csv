Verified the collection is functional against the localhost.","1. Set the scan server selection to either Local or Automatic (remote for Windows)
2. Run SEEK scan and import jobs
3. Observe no data","At this time we have not received recent or artifacts demonstrating a true failure of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.  We have seen evidence of the scan abruptly ending. We asked and did not receive any indication from you if there were sudden resource spikes around this time.

We have been unable to to identify any indication of malfuction except for this abrupt ending which may be cause by any number of external factors.","A fix was published in December 2024 for the Senstive Data add-on where resource consumption would grow unexpected and the scan would produce and out of memory or similar errors then crash. NEA 11.6.0.125 and SDD 11.6.0.14. We would need to know the most recent build of NEA nad the SDD Add-on to determine that this fix is implemented.","Issue is resolved by upgrading to NEA v11.6.0.138+","Product defect","Tay Caliguiri","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows File Systems","Sensitive Data","11.6","","143.9","Closed - Resolved","PrimeSource Building Products, Inc.","Jeff Forsyth","2024-11-21T16:31:40.000Z","2025-04-14T13:55:29.000Z"
