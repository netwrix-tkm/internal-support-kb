It's my understanding that your team does not utilize Salesforce Chatter, so I am emailing from the support ticket. 

Do you have the customer contact details for me to add to the support case so I can work directly with the client to resolve the issue at hand?

Thank you,

Hi Tay,

 

Neither scan succeeded, and all the different scan types were only attempted due to the failure of the default scan modes failing. Endpoint security was supposed to have been turned off, and was checked multiple times throughout.

 

Are we able to get a resource on a call with the customer where we can execute the scan in any way you'd like. I've exhausted all of my tools/tricks, and this has been dragged out fairly long because of the customer.

Hey Jeff,

Dev needs a bit more clarity on how the collection was verified by running against the localhost:

	Was the local mode scan only used when targeting the localhost, or was PSFS01 targeted using local mode scans?
	If PSFS01 used both local and remote scans, did the local mode scan succeed?


Remote scanning uses the target host as a proxy if the target host is a Windows server, so if local mode scans are succeeding and remote scans are failing it would indicate that the problem is on the execution host. The logs indicate the FSAAScanHost.exe is being terminated during the scan, so I am trying to determine if the issue is specific to the execution host or if this issue is present regardless of the execution host.

Dev would also like to know if there is any endpoint security software in the customer's environment that could be killing FSAAScanHost.exe, because this has been the cause for issues in the past with similar symptoms.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hi Tay and team,

 

Apologies for the delay, I was out for an appointment yesterday and am just catching up.

 

The collection was both local and remote, no proxy though. It performed similarly with streaming appearing to capture results and nothing actually being brought to the database.

Hey Jeff,

The logs indicate that the scan is abruptly terminating. During the scan is there a spike in CPU and/or memory usage on the proxy? When confirming that collection worked against the local host was this a local or proxy mode scan targeting the local host?

Thank you,

Hey Jeff,

Looks like the most recent upload from the customer is still not what dev is looking for- they want the entire FSAA JOB folder structure and SEEK JOB folder structure, or a screenshot of them so they can let the customer know which specific artifacts can be omitted.

These folders can be found in the %SAInstallDir%JobsGROUP_FileSystem location.

Let me know if you need any further assistance!

Thank you,

Hi Tay,

 

I just got off PTO, but the customer did try uploading while I was out of town. Iâ€™m gonna reach out and see whatâ€™s going on.

 

Thanks for staying on top of this, I know this one must be showing up on all your reviewsâ€¦ ðŸ˜¬. Hopefully we can get them sorted in the new year!

Hey Jeff,

While it looks like the customer uploaded some applet logs, development is looking for:

From the logs, it looks like sensitive data is being collected. Could we get the latest FSAA and SEEK job folders with their entire log structures? If either is too large, could you screenshot the structures so we can advise which items can be omitted from the collection?

Can you please have the customer upload the above or provide the screenshots for dev to narrow down the scope of what they need uploaded?

Thank you,

I absolutely still need assistance, I am working with Ethan and Farrah now. All the logs are there, and a single sensitive file will have been imported from a localhost check. Nothing else is getting imported.

 

There also seems to have been a delay from my update, to when the ticket status changes rolled in from yesterday. The delay could be Salesforce or caching from my machine though.

Hi Tay,

I apologize for not having any updates, we are trying to work it out from the sales end and with the partner for what the best next steps are. This has been a protracted process because of them, EoY's for both companies, and how this issue has had no apparent resolution. There is no surprise here though, I don't normally come knocking unless there is an actual issue.

The partner and ourselves are keeping it on life supportfor the time being, and will update once we are able to engage again. Thank you for continuing to check-in and work with us Tay!

At this time we have not received recent or artifacts demonstrating a true failure of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.  We have seen evidence of the scan abruptly ending. We asked and did not receive any indication from you if there were sudden resource spikes around this time.

We have been unable to to identify any indication of malfuction except for this abrupt ending which may be cause by any number of external factors.

A fix was published in December 2024 for the Senstive Data add-on where resource consumption would grow unexpected and the scan would produce and out of memory or similar errors then crash. NEA 11.6.0.125 and SDD 11.6.0.14. We would need to know the most recent build of NEA nad the SDD Add-on to determine that this fix is implemented.

If you are able to provide further results of a recent scan or include Tay in a meeting with the customer we can continue to investigate with you.

Thank you,

Hi Tay,

 

I apologize for not having any updates, we are trying to work it out from the sales end and with the partner for what the best next steps are. This has been a protracted process because of them, EoY's for both companies, and how this issue has had no apparent resolution. There is no surprise here though, I don't normally come knocking unless there is an actual issue. 

 

The partner and ourselves are keeping it on life supportfor the time being, and will update once we are able to engage again. Thank you for continuing to check-in and work with us Tay!

Understood Tay,

I would just ask again that if we are able to re-engage with them that yourself or someone on your team is able to join the call. Nothing about a version update/fix had been brought up until just now, but I'm happy to try that so long as someone from the team is able to join with us if the customer is amicable.

I understand we were mired in trying to collect the logs around 'December 2024' when the suggested fix came out, but when was it identified as a possible solution for us to try for this particular issue? This is the first I'm hearing it as the last suggestion was it was a known issue the team had asked for information for on the 6th:

@Jeff Forsythâ€‹ This appears to be related to a known issue we have with a few other customers. To expedite the investigation of this, please update the ticket with the correct contact from the customer so we can continue. I will need to collect the debug job logs, and the Windows Event Application log from the customer in order to confirm our suspicions.



Has this job been run since November '24? Despite the logs being uploaded recently, there are no updated runs from 2025. There is also a running.lck file in the SEEK System Scan folder.

Hi Tay,



We don't typically communicate through chatter, but I had passed this along to the team to try and arrange a call with them and yourselves on a call. we'll ask for dates/times from them if it's possible for someone to join the call with us




There was some confusion with suddenly switching to chatter, was there somewhere else I should've been looking for this other suggestion?


Thanks again for staying on top of this.

Hi Jeff,

At this time we have not received recent or artifacts demonstrating a true failure of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.  We have seen evidence of the scan abruptly ending. We asked and did not receive any indication from you if there were sudden resource spikes around this time.

We have been unable to to identify any indication of malfuction except for this abrupt ending which may be cause by any number of external factors.

A fix was published in December 2024 for the Senstive Data add-on where resource consumption would grow unexpected and the scan would produce and out of memory or similar errors then crash. NEA 11.6.0.125 and SDD 11.6.0.14. We would need to know the most recent build of NEA nad the SDD Add-on to determine that this fix is implemented.

If you are able to provide further results of a recent scan or include Tay in a meeting with the customer we can continue to investigate with you.

Thank you,

Awesome, thank you Tay!

Now we wait... ha

We are trying our best to get the customer re-engaged, so it's a bit of a 'kid-glove' scenario at the moment unsurprisingly.Hopefully it's sooner than later, but we'll make sure to get your confirmation for any scheduling beforehand.


Much appreciated,

Awesome, thank you Tay!

 

Now we wait... ha

 

We are trying our best to get the customer re-engaged, so it's a bit of a 'kid-glove' scenario at the moment unsurprisingly.Hopefully it's sooner than later, but we'll make sure to get your confirmation for any scheduling beforehand.

 

 

Much appreciated,

Understood Tay,

 

I would just ask again that if we are able to re-engage with them that yourself or someone on your team is able to join the call. Nothing about a version update/fix had been brought up until just now, but I'm happy to try that so long as someone from the team is able to join with us if the customer is amicable.

 

I understand we were mired in trying to collect the logs around 'December 2024' when the suggested fix came out, but when was it identified as a possible solution for us to try for this particular issue? This is the first I'm hearing it as the last suggestion was it was a known issue the team had asked for information for on the 6th:

@Jeff Forsythâ€‹ This appears to be related to a known issue we have with a few other customers. To expedite the investigation of this, please update the ticket with the correct contact from the customer so we can continue. I will need to collect the debug job logs, and the Windows Event Application log from the customer in order to confirm our suspicions.

 

 

 

Has this job been run since November '24? Despite the logs being uploaded recently, there are no updated runs from 2025. There is also a running.lck file in the SEEK System Scan folder.

Hi Tay,

 

 

 

We don't typically communicate through chatter, but I had passed this along to the team to try and arrange a call with them and yourselves on a call. we'll ask for dates/times from them if it's possible for someone to join the call with us

 

 

 

 

There was some confusion with suddenly switching to chatter, was there somewhere else I should've been looking for this other suggestion?

 

 

Thanks again for staying on top of this.

Hi Jeff,

At this time we have not received recent or artifacts demonstrating a true failure of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.  We have seen evidence of the scan abruptly ending. We asked and did not receive any indication from you if there were sudden resource spikes around this time.

We have been unable to to identify any indication of malfuction except for this abrupt ending which may be cause by any number of external factors.

A fix was published in December 2024 for the Senstive Data add-on where resource consumption would grow unexpected and the scan would produce and out of memory or similar errors then crash. NEA 11.6.0.125 and SDD 11.6.0.14. We would need to know the most recent build of NEA nad the SDD Add-on to determine that this fix is implemented.

If you are able to provide further results of a recent scan or include Tay in a meeting with the customer we can continue to investigate with you.

Thank you,

Brandon West

Hi Tay,

 

I apologize for not having any updates, we are trying to work it out from the sales end and with the partner for what the best next steps are. This has been a protracted process because of them, EoY's for both companies, and how this issue has had no apparent resolution. There is no surprise here though, I don't normally come knocking unless there is an actual issue. 

 

The partner and ourselves are keeping it on life supportfor the time being, and will update once we are able to engage again. Thank you for continuing to check-in and work with us Tay!

Hi Tay,

Apologies, I've been holding off hoping that the customer would get back to us.

I would say it's up to you and what works best for your team on how to handle the ticket. If there's a 'stalled' state or something that'd be preferred in case they do get back to us, but that's up to you now.

Thank you again for all the support.
