Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix Technical Support.
Do you remember adding any additional servers to the scan?
We will need the log to analyze the data to see what has changed since you said it used to run for about three hours.
 
If the job is not on debug, right-click on it and click Properties. Under the General tab, you will see Log Level. Click the drop-down menu and select Debug if it's not already on Debug.
 
If the job was not on Debug, you will need to run it after setting it to Debug to collect the data.
If it was already on Debug, you can collect the log and upload it to this ticket so we can review it.
 
To collect the log, right-click on the job and select Explore Folder
Open the output folder, and you will see the System Scan log.tsv, which you can attach or upload to this ticket.
 
Thanks,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session we:

	Set the number of probable owners scanned for from unlimited to 4
	Increased from 3 to 6 threads on the SEEK scan
	Verified the FSAA and SEEK scans were not stepping on each others toes


Let me know how the next run looks when it finishes and we can either revisit the current configuration and any additional performance we can get out of it, or possibly split the scans out a bit more.

Thank you,
