I reviewed NAM's configuration and it is configured to collected the desired data. I couldn't get NAM search to return data from the share, but I did find it in NAM's raw agent logs

I also founf the data in NEA's SQL database
-SA_FSAC_DailyActivityView

their analysis task filters that table to create a new table that is used to generate the report
--filters for isoutlookinterval|Yesterday|
--and not a particular user

originally configured by PS

everything looks good
make a test change and will wait until tomorrow to see if it's reported","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-11-13T19:00:58.000Z"
