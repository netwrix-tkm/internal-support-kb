I am looking for an audit report for password change by who. 
Detail is:
Caller NT account (Who make the change)
Description (Account enable / Disable /reset account's password)
NT Account (The windows account got change)
Time (Date and Time caller make the change)

I can't find anything like that in enterprise auditor.

Thanks,

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved. 
The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

2024_1010: Terence copied the existing ""Account Changes Report"" and modified it to get the information that he needed: 
Who locked and unlocked accounts and performed password changed.

See the attached screenshot = ""User_Account_Lock_and_Password_Change_Report_image_2024_1010.png""

Yes, I was able to copy the ""account changes report"" and modified it got the information I needed. 
Who locked and unlocked, password changed.

I found out that when I building the report is was not data shows, it only shows when I run the report send by email as PDF. 
It make it harder to create an report without the data.
