We need to have two more columns for Empty Groups reports for AD. It contains Group name and when created when changed type and scope. To have more clarity we want Description of the group and Managed by ab details from the AD in the report. Please help on priority. It is little urgent.

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen V.Huilgol.","","","","1. Intergated those columns with SA_PS_EmtpyGroups_View:

IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].SA_PS_EmptyGroups_View') AND type in (N'V'))
DROP VIEW SA_PS_EmptyGroups_View

GO

CREATE VIEW [SA_PS_EmptyGroups_View] AS
SELECT ege.[Domain], ege.[Group], gv.[Description], ege.[NT Name], dnM.Value AS [Managed By], ege.[PrincipalId], ege.[Member Of], ege.[Type], gv.WhenCreated, gv.WhenChanged
FROM dbo.SA_AD_EmptyGroups_Empty ege
LEFT JOIN dbo.SA_ADInventory_GroupsView gv ON gv.[PrincipalId] = ege.[PrincipalId]
LEFT JOIN dbo.SA_ADInventory_DistinguishedNames dnM ON dnM.[PrincipalId] = gv.[ManagedByPrincipalId]
WHERE (gv.Distinguishedname NOT LIKE '%CN=Users,DC=etihad,DC=local' AND gv.DistinguishedName NOT LIKE '%OU=Microsoft Exchange Security Groups,DC=etihad,DC=local')

2. Recreated the ""Empty Group Details"" table in the ""Empty Groups"" report.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Aleksandr Timofeev","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Active Directory","Reports","11.5","","10.2","Closed - Resolved","IBM - Etihad Airways","Praveen Huilgol","2024-09-16T07:57:25.000Z","2024-09-26T11:44:22.000Z"
