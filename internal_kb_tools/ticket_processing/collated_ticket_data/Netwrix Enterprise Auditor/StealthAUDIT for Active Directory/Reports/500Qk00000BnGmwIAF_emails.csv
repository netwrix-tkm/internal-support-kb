Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:

Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path

#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path

#OR

Could I get some details on the needed group change report to see if I can mock up something from the caned reports under
Jobs > Active Directory > 6.Activity > Group Usage

These details are pulled in NEA from the StealthINTERCEPT agents (SIa) on the DCs via Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM) formally Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM) agent

Thank You for your time.

Dusty,

See attached for output results. FYI, there was not output for last command (Activity Monitor).

I'll look to create report for a specific AD group when there is a member change. I'd also like to see if its possible to add monitoring (Activity details) to a C:Program Files (x86) folder on a specific server.

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                    11.5.0.205    
StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC)     11.5.0.120    
SA Sensitive Data (SDD)                                           11.5.0.65
Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM) formally Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM) ????  We see the SAM Agent Services however we do not see the Control console.

Created a job based on the prior Job group to filter with the following Analysis.

IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = object_id(N'[dbo].[SA_PP_Groups]') AND TYPE in (N'U'))
  DROP TABLE [SA_PP_Groups]
SELECT * Into [SA_PP_Groups]
From SA_AD_Changes_GroupMembershipChanges
Where [Group] like '%PP-%' And [when discovered] >= DATEADD(day, -1, GETDATE())

Updated the URL settings
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Installation > Installation & Configuration Overview > Reports via the Web Console > Securing the Web Console
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm

Netwrix Access Information Center 11.6 > Installation Overview > Securing the Access Information Center
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Secure.htm


Will need to update the Email recipients for the new PP-Groups Report based on the SA_AD_Changes_GroupMembershipChanges table.

Added the additional Windows File Server.

Thank You for the update, I will close out this ticket as noted.

We have 30days to reopen once the closure email is received.

To reopen we can just reply to that email to bring the case back into my queue.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return.

Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link.

Have a great weekend.

Again, thank You for your time.
