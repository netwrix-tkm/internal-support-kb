2024_1010: Terence copied the existing ""Account Changes Report"" and modified it to get the information that I needed: Who locked and unlocked accounts and performed password changed.

See the attached screenshot = ""User_Account_Lock_and_Password_Change_Report_image_2024_1010.png""

Yes, I was able to copy the ""account changes report"" and modified it got the information I needed. Who locked and unlocked, password changed.

I found out that when I building the report is was not data shows, it only shows when I run the report send by email as pdf. It make it harder to create an report without the data.
