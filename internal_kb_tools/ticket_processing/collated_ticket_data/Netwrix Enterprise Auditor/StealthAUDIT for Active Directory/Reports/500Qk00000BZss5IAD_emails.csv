Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support. The Active Directory > 2. Users > SIDHistory job may be what you're looking for, however, if that data is missing from AD completely so I'm not sure if NEA will be able to extrapolate that data.

Thank you,

Hi Tay,

Yes thanks for the follow up. I was able to connect the GroupMembersView ADI table with the Users table and pull in the “isdeleted” attribute to identify which users that still belong to AD groups but their actual AD account no longer exists.

Kind of a weird use case but seems really useful to consider for an out of the box report.

Anyways this is good we can close the case.

Thanks!
Michael
