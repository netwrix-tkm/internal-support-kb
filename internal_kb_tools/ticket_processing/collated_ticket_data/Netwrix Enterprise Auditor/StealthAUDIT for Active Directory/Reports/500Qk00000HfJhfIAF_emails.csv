Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we investigated your daily File Server activity report that's scoped to one particular HR folder. The expected behavior is that the report should only return activity from the previous day. You showed me that the reports on 10/25 and 10/30 both reported the same activity that occurred on 10/23.

I reviewed the configuration Netwrix Activity Monitor and confirmed that it's correctly collecting activity from that share. We reviewed the logs and found fresh data from that share. I also reviewed the analysis task which creates a filtered table based on the SQL view, SA_FSAC_DailyActivityView. That view has fresh data, but the filtered table is blank. This is actually expected because there was no activity meeting the filter requirements and SQL views cleared each time it's run.

I've been discussing this internally and reviewing the way the analysis task is filtering the data. I think we've identified the issue. Please let me know how it looks tomorrow, and the next day. In the meantime, I'd like to schedule another meeting where we tweak that filter to improve the reliability of the results.

Hello Rick,

Thank you for providing the extra details and logs. I've looked through them and it looks like the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor side is working as expected. I'd like to review the configuration of Activity Monitor. Are you available for a remote session? Please use the following link to schedule a remote session at your convenience:

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=RIk9ScSLL89hl7AmAg4WXtIvH7Nhoai_fY5Vca5tUds-Z&MeetingID=ePlW1NrPufAaFLcXbHlM794sorG1dCcWzCdYOLc4hzo-Z

I'll need access to the Netwrix application server, but we might need to check the SQL server as well.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton
