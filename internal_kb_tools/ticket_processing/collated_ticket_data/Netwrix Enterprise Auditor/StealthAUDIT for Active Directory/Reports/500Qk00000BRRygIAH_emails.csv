Thank you for reaching out to support. 
We are aligning your ticket with an engineer to assist with your issue. They will reach out to you as soon as possible. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

If using Windows Auth to connect to the SQL Server set the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server Service to run as that account.
Ref-image if needed:

Ahmed,

Thank you for reaching out to support.
We are aligning your ticket with an engineer to assist with your issue. They will reach out to you as soon as possible.

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR

If using Windows Auth to connect to the SQL Server set the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server Service to run as that account.
Ref-image if needed:

Just to check, could you please open the browser which gives you the error and check which certificate is used by the page? If there's no certificate - it means that you need to properly bind SSL to a port.

Ahmed,

Just to check, could you please open the browser which gives you the error and check which certificate is used by the page? If there's no certificate - it means that you need to properly bind SSL to a port.

Best wishes,

Ahmed,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 
We are aligning your ticket with an engineer to assist with your issue. They will reach out to you as soon as possible. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

If using Windows Auth to connect to the SQL Server set the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server Service to run as that account.
Ref-image if needed:


Thank You for your time.

Thank you for your time today. 

On this meeting we changed your Web Server service to be ran as an account with Database access, which is a requirement to access the Published Reports.
You can fid the reasoning and or recommendations in this KB article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000000Qs9KAE.html

This is due to Web Server service requiring a way to connect to the database to actually show you the reports, as well as be able to auth the users by their set roles.

Please let me know if this ticket can be closed.

Ahmed,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 
We are aligning your ticket with an engineer to assist with your issue. They will reach out to you as soon as possible. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

If using Windows Auth to connect to the SQL Server set the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server Service to run as that account.
Ref-image if needed:


Thank You for your time.

Ahmed,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we changed your Web Server service to be ran as an account with Database access, which is a requirement to access the Published Reports.
You can fid the reasoning and or recommendations in this KB article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000000Qs9KAE.html

This is due to Web Server service requiring a way to connect to the database to actually show you the reports, as well as be able to auth the users by their set roles.

Please let me know if this ticket can be closed.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Ahmed,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 
We are aligning your ticket with an engineer to assist with your issue. They will reach out to you as soon as possible. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or `  $_.Name  -like ""Python*"")}  -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue  |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

If using Windows Auth to connect to the SQL Server set the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server Service to run as that account.
Ref-image if needed:


Thank You for your time.
