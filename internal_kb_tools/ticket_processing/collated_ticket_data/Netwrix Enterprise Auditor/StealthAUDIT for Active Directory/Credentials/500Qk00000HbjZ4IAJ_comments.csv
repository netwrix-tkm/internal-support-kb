@Salesforce this one is on the backlog. Due to release work overrunning, it will be January before this is looked at.

@Salesforce @Sanjay Meghani
We have a couple of questions about the customer's setup:

	 - 	Is there a trust between Domain 1 and Domain 2?
	 - 	Was this setup previously? If so was it after a version update and from which versions did this break?
	 - 	Is there a missing SPN registration?
	 - 	When this issue occurs, does anything display on the Domain Controller's Event Viewer?

There is an article about a similar issue which deals with adding the service principal name (SPN): https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/kerberos-event-4-access-denied


These are the commands for verifying the SPN registration and adding an SPN to a domain account.

setspn -F -Q */<fqdn of the AIC server>
--- CODE ---

This will list all the SPN that existed in the forest. The incorrectly registered SPN can be removed by running the following command

setspn -D <SPN> <computername>
--- CODE ---

If the SPN is not registered then you can add it by this command, if the AIC service is running under a domain account

setspn -U -S http/<fqdn of AIC server> <useraccount>
--- CODE ---

If the AIC server is running under a local system account

setspn -S http/<fqdn of AIC server> <AICserverName>
--- CODE ---

Even with a correct SPN registered, the client-server still needs to have ""AuthServerAllowlist"" andor Internet options configured as mentioned in our documentation:
