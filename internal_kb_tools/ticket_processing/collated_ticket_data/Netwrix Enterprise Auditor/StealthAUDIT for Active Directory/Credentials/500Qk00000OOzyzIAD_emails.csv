1) Did you run the .Active Directory Inventory job group (where the ""ADInventory_UsersView"" resides) and this is when the service account got locked out?
You probably did not have DEBUG turned on when you ran this job and therefor it would probably not be useful to attach that log to this case.

Please use the link below to schedule the meeting for ""Netwrix Support Ticket #00"". Clicking the link will launch a scheduling page that displays attendees and available meeting times. Please select a time, add any additional information, click ""Schedule Meeting"", and you will receive a confirmation email.

We look forward to speaking with you soon!

Thank you,

We didn't actually run a job. We just ran the query from Host Discovery.
I will get that meeting scheduled as soon as I can get some time with Patrick.
