1) Please confirm that you can access this article and read through the article first and observe the screenshots.

Please proceed very carefully while following this article:
Update Service Account Password Upon Password Change in Active Directory (AD)
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000IKbCAM.html


2) For emphasis, I am adding screenshots of the first 2 places that I would review as this is an event in windows that you have sent up the output of:

There can/could be more services then just the 3 StealthAUDIT (v11.5) or NEA (v11.6) services found when opening ""Services.msc"":




3) Here is probably the first setting that you should check in StealthAUDIT (or NEA):



4) If you still cannot figure out where you are having authentication problems then please email me back to request a meeting invite.

Thank you,
