We need to collect from a domain that is not primary for jobs that use the one domain controller per domain as the host For example: ADInventory_UsersView.
We created a new discovery query for this domain. This worked in the sense that it did connect to the domain as we expected. However, the service account we use for collecting our primary domain locked out. We had to delete the new job and get the account unlocked for that original query to work again.
We have a connection set up that has the connections for all our domains in that one connector so that when jobs are collecting from other Windows servers they can work regardless of the domain the server is on. We don't understand why running one query would have locked the account on a domain that the query is not connecting to. Again, since this is production we don't want to just try things until we get it to work. We are looking for some guidance on how to proceed.
Thanks much,
Michael Stephenson","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-24T11:36:58.000Z"
