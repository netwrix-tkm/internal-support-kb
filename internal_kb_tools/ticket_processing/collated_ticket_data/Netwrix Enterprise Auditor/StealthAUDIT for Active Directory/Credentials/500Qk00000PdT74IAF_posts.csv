They are programmatically created at ~00:00 every morning and then deleted just before midnight of the same day.  Those accounts that have been deleted are not showing as deleted; however, they are not present in our external AD.","","","","0054u000006goG0AAI","2025-05-27T17:16:49.000Z"

""Granting Permissions for 'Deleted Objects' Container""
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/1Secure/page/Content/1Secure/Admin/DataCollection/ActiveDirectory/PermissionsADContainer.htm


2) When then tried to test if the VaronisDCDMZ AD account can search for deleted objects based upon SID 
but then decided that re-running the .Active Directory Inventory job would take very little time based upon historical run times of about 12 seconds:

get-adobject -Filter 'isdeleted -eq $true -and name -ne ""Deleted Objects"" -and objectSID -like ""Enter SID here""' -IncludeDeletedObjects -Properties samaccountname,displayname,objectsid


3) The first run still resulted in 14,886 Users showing up for the ""sco.idaho.gov"" domain.

4) We then navigated to: 

.Active Directory Inventory > 1-AD_Scan > Configure > Queries >  Options > 

and we deselected: ""Collect only updates since the last scan""

This change may add a minute to your .ADI collection time but this is negligible in relation to your overall processing times for a job that you run daily. 

5) After running the AD Inventory job with ""Collect only updates since the last scan"" deselected, you show only 495 users under the ""sco.idaho.com"" domain.","","","","005Qk00000276ifIAA","2025-05-28T20:37:47.000Z"
