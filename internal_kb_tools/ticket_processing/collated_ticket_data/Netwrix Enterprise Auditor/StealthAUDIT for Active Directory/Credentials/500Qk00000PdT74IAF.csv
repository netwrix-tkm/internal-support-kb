"500Qk00000PdT74IAF","00446347","Support Ticket","Deleted User Objects Investigation","Customer has a second domain with some dynamic accounts that they create and delete daily.  They are programmatically created at ~00:00 every morning and then deleted just before midnight of the same day.  Those accounts that have been deleted are not showing as deleted; however, they are not present in our external AD.","1) On the call today, we walked through the following Netwrix Help Article to grant permissions for deleted accounts to your VaronisDCDMZ AD account:

""Granting Permissions for 'Deleted Objects' Container""
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/1Secure/page/Content/1Secure/Admin/DataCollection/ActiveDirectory/PermissionsADContainer.htm


2) We then tried to test if the VaronisDCDMZ AD account can search for deleted objects based upon SID but then decided that re-running the .Active Directory Inventory job would take very little time based upon historical run times of about 12 seconds:

get-adobject -Filter 'isdeleted -eq $true -and name -ne ""Deleted Objects"" -and objectSID -like ""Enter SID here""' -IncludeDeletedObjects -Properties samaccountname,displayname,objectsid


3) The first run still resulted in 14,886 Users showing up for the ""sco.idaho.gov"" domain.

4) We then navigated to: 

.Active Directory Inventory > 1-AD_Scan > Configure > Queries >  Options > 

and we deselected: ""Collect only updates since the last scan""

This change may add a minute to your .ADI collection time but this is negligible in relation to your overall processing times for the .Active Directory Inventory job that you run daily. 

5) After running the AD Inventory job with ""Collect only updates since the last scan"" deselected, you show only 495 users under the ""sco.idaho.com"" domain.","1) On the call today, we walked through the following Netwrix Help Article to grant permissions for deleted accounts to your VaronisDCDMZ AD account:
