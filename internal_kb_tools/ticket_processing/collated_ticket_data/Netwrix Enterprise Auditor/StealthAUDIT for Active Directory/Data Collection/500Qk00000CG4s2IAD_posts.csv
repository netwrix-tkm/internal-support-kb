Customer advised that issue still not resolved and showed troubled hostlist ""AC - DC"". We've reviewed the hostlist you AD - DC and a lot of hosts were missing data and were in either ""in queue"" or  ""in progress"" state, after refreshing all of the hosts it seems like query started populating the data. 

Customer took few days to test and advised that issue is still not resolved, pointing out following:

""Below is the host count based on region & OU structure, it should match to the various host query output however its not matching.

On meeting with customer to address last issue we're tried to launch troubled hostlist query manually to see if it's picking up any data, hostlist query failed to launch due to permissions issue.


Customer is running full ADI scans, aside of custom attributes warnings, ADI job finishes fine.

On meeting we've reviewed troubled hostlists:
1. GRM_AD_APPLICATIONS hostlist is working as intended, Vinay was comparing incorrect OU to hostlist query results, we've compared host count to AD host count for target OU, it matches.

2. GRM_AD_AZURE - doesn't have hosts, on attempt to run query manually - insufficient permissions error - Vinay will speak to infra team to resolve this.

3. GRM_AD_EMEA - correct number of hosts, but no details for collected hosts, disabled clean up job and requested to run query manually, waiting for results.

So far the only issue left that might be on our side is hostlist that collects hostnames and count, but doesn't collect details - example - GRM_AD_EMEA hostlist, will clarify and escalate if this is still an issue after manual scan.","","","","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2024-11-04T09:53:15.000Z"

Is that host not showing up the only real impact here beyond just missing values for the host? Are other aspects of their scans or reports breaking? If not then I&#39;d ask if we could lower the priority on this one. Let me know. </p>","","","","0050g000006QqyEAAS","2024-12-10T17:50:42.000Z"
