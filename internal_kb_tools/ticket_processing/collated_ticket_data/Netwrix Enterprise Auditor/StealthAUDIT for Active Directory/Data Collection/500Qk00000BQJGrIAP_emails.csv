Hi Jakub,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support.

We are aligning your ticket with an engineer in your time zone to assist with your issue. They will reach out to you as soon as possible.

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

Thank you,

Hi Jakub,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support.

We are aligning your ticket with an engineer in your time zone to assist with your issue. They will reach out to you as soon as possible.

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

Thank you,

If you right click on the failing job, it should have an option to open the logs for it. If that doesn't work - please use this article to locate the logs: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Maintenance/Troubleshooting.htm

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm
Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Please let me know if you are going to proceed with this.

Name of the new server: USNH10WS024

 

Name of the issued servers: VNBH01WS4003, VNBH01WS4004, VNBH01WS4005

 

Thank you

Jakub

Jakub,

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm
Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Please let me know if you are going to proceed with this.

Hello Ilya,

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn't encounter any issue until now.

Thank you for your respond

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!KkVubWw!n1SVr9v6X_yJh9ey41lMPn04K4b9ZJkfZ2mdddTASnFVyCwdWEE_8bmUm3CvjLI3goK5XL2q1DgYJFH1Pux3KtF7EfobVvg$>

If you right click on the failing job, it should have an option to open the logs for it.

Hi Jakub,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support.

We are aligning your ticket with an engineer in your time zone to assist with your issue. They will reach out to you as soon as possible.

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.


11.0	December 17, 2020	April 26, 2024	
10.0	April 15, 2020	May 18, 2022

https://www.netwrix.com/supported_versions.html#sta

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.

Hello Ilya,

 

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn’t encounter any issue until now.

 

Thank you for your respond

Jakub,

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6:  https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm
Upgrade instructions:  https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Please let me know if you are going to proceed with this.

Best wishes,

If you right click on the failing job, it should have an option to open the logs for it. If that doesn't work - please use this article to locate the logs: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Maintenance/Troubleshooting.htm

Hi Jakub,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support.

We are aligning your ticket with an engineer in your time zone to assist with your issue. They will reach out to you as soon as possible.

Hello Ilya,

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

Thank you
Jakub

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.



11.0    December 17, 2020      April 26, 2024

10.0    April 15, 2020 May 18, 2022

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.

Hello Ilya,

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn't encounter any issue until now.

Thank you for your respond

Jakub,

If you right click on the failing job, it should have an option to open the logs for it. If that doesn't work - please use this article to locate the logs: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Maintenance/Troubleshooting.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Maintenance/Troubleshooting.htm__;!!KkVubWw!n1SVr9v6X_yJh9ey41lMPn04K4b9ZJkfZ2mdddTASnFVyCwdWEE_8bmUm3CvjLI3goK5XL2q1DgYJFH1Pux3KtF7KeV9-Cw$>

Hello Ilya,

 

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

 

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

 

Thank you

Jakub

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.



11.0    December 17, 2020      April 26, 2024 


10.0    April 15, 2020 May 18, 2022


https://www.netwrix.com/supported_versions.html#sta

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.
Our end of support policy: https://www.netwrix.com/download/documents/Netwrix_Support_Policy.pdf

Hello Ilya,

 

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn’t encounter any issue until now.

 

Thank you for your respond

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6:  https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm
Upgrade instructions:  https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Please let me know if you are going to proceed with this.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Jakub,

If you right click on the failing job, it should have an option to open the logs for it. If that doesn't work - please use this article to locate the logs: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Maintenance/Troubleshooting.htm

Hello Ilya,

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

Thank you
Jakub

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.



11.0    December 17, 2020      April 26, 2024



10.0    April 15, 2020 May 18, 2022

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.

Hello Ilya,

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn't encounter any issue until now.

Thank you for your respond

Jakub,

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!KkVubWw!n1SVr9v6X_yJh9ey41lMPn04K4b9ZJkfZ2mdddTASnFVyCwdWEE_8bmUm3CvjLI3goK5XL2q1DgYJFH1Pux3KtF7EfobVvg$>

Hello Ilya,

 

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

 

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

 

Thank you

Jakub

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.



11.0    December 17, 2020      April 26, 2024 



 


10.0    April 15, 2020 May 18, 2022


https://www.netwrix.com/supported_versions.html#sta

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.

Hello Ilya,

 

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn’t encounter any issue until now.

 

Thank you for your respond

Jakub,

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6:  https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm
Upgrade instructions:  https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Please let me know if you are going to proceed with this.

Jakub,

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6:  https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm
Upgrade instructions:  https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Please let me know if you are going to proceed with this.

Best wishes,

Hello Ilya,

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

Thank you
Jakub

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.



11.0    December 17, 2020      April 26, 2024







10.0    April 15, 2020 May 18, 2022

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.

Hello Ilya,

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn't encounter any issue until now.

Thank you for your respond

Jakub

Jakub,

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!KkVubWw!n1SVr9v6X_yJh9ey41lMPn04K4b9ZJkfZ2mdddTASnFVyCwdWEE_8bmUm3CvjLI3goK5XL2q1DgYJFH1Pux3KtF7EfobVvg$>

Hello Ilya,

 

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

 

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

 

Thank you

Jakub

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.

11.0    December 17, 2020      April 26, 2024 

 

 

 

10.0    April 15, 2020 May 18, 2022

https://www.netwrix.com/supported_versions.html#sta

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.

Hello Ilya,

 

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn’t encounter any issue until now.

 

Thank you for your respond

Jakub,

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm
Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Please let me know if you are going to proceed with this.

Could you please send me the scan logs? Right click the scan job and it should have a link to logs there.

Hello Ilya,

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

Thank you
Jakub

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.

Hello Ilya,

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn't encounter any issue until now.

Thank you for your respond

Jakub

Jakub,

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!KkVubWw!n1SVr9v6X_yJh9ey41lMPn04K4b9ZJkfZ2mdddTASnFVyCwdWEE_8bmUm3CvjLI3goK5XL2q1DgYJFH1Pux3KtF7EfobVvg$>

Hello Ilya,

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

Thank you
Jakub

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.

11.0    December 17, 2020      April 26, 2024




10.0    April 15, 2020 May 18, 2022

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.

Hello Ilya,

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn’t encounter any issue until now.

Thank you for your respond

Jakub,

If you right click on the failing job, it should have an option to open the logs for it. If that doesn't work - please use this article to locate the logs: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Maintenance/Troubleshooting.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Maintenance/Troubleshooting.htm__;!!KkVubWw!n1SVr9v6X_yJh9ey41lMPn04K4b9ZJkfZ2mdddTASnFVyCwdWEE_8bmUm3CvjLI3goK5XL2q1DgYJFH1Pux3KtF7KeV9-Cw$>

Hi Jakub,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support.

We are aligning your ticket with an engineer in your time zone to assist with your issue. They will reach out to you as soon as possible.

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |

Hello Ilya,

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

Thank you
Jakub

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.

11.0    December 17, 2020      April 26, 2024





10.0    April 15, 2020 May 18, 2022

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.
Our end of support policy: https://www.netwrix.com/download/documents/Netwrix_Support_Policy.pdf<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.netwrix.com/download/documents/Netwrix_Support_Policy.pdf__;!!KkVubWw!hMHbr7aEM5gT3EYICGoUDWwgVAR9CjfKxHjAjyPFYxY2efo9F05hEzs7KxZljT7-DYV6G_qGgwu92HP1yF2OE0NepwItCoo$>

Hello Ilya,

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn't encounter any issue until now.

Thank you for your respond

Jakub

Jakub,

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!KkVubWw!n1SVr9v6X_yJh9ey41lMPn04K4b9ZJkfZ2mdddTASnFVyCwdWEE_8bmUm3CvjLI3goK5XL2q1DgYJFH1Pux3KtF7EfobVvg$>

Hello Ilya,

 

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

 

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

 

Thank you

Jakub

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.



11.0    December 17, 2020      April 26, 2024 



 


 


10.0    April 15, 2020 May 18, 2022


https://www.netwrix.com/supported_versions.html#sta

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.

Hello Ilya,

 

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn’t encounter any issue until now.

 

Thank you for your respond

Jakub,

Jakub,

If you right click on the failing job, it should have an option to open the logs for it. If that doesn't work - please use this article to locate the logs: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Maintenance/Troubleshooting.htm

Hello Ilya,

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

Thank you
Jakub

S pozdravom/Best regards

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.



11.0    December 17, 2020      April 26, 2024













10.0    April 15, 2020 May 18, 2022

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.

Hello Ilya,

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn't encounter any issue until now.

Thank you for your respond

Jakub

Jakub,

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!KkVubWw!n1SVr9v6X_yJh9ey41lMPn04K4b9ZJkfZ2mdddTASnFVyCwdWEE_8bmUm3CvjLI3goK5XL2q1DgYJFH1Pux3KtF7EfobVvg$>

Jakub,

Could you please send me the scan logs? Right click the scan job and it should have a link to logs there.

Hello Ilya,

 

Sure, if the support ended 2 years ago we need to upgrade to supported version. We had a discussion with my team and SA is currently running on old win 2008 server and we would like to upgrade it as well. My question is, when we build new Server it is possible to migrate SA from current Server to new one and then upgrade it or we can deploy new server deploy new SA on it and then migrate data from old SA to new one?

 

Also are you able to assist us with the migration and upgrade of SA?

 

Thank you

Jakub

Jakub,

It is not specifically necessary now, but there are reasons to consider doing it:

1) The issue might be related to an already fixed bug
2) The new version has improved features and stability
3) The version you are currently using is out of support for over 2 years by now.

11.0    December 17, 2020      April 26, 2024 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10.0    April 15, 2020 May 18, 2022

https://www.netwrix.com/supported_versions.html#sta

While I can offer you limited support on it, I must emphasize that it is necessary to update.

Hello Ilya,

 

I think this issue is related only to these three systems. Is it necessary to upgrade our StealthAudit to newer version? Because we didn’t encounter any issue until now.

 

Thank you for your respond

Jakub,

Upon reviewing this I must recommend a version upgrade if it is possible for your environment. Te version you're using is quite outdated.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm
Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Please let me know if you are going to proceed with this.

Hello Ilya,

 

I managed to find the logs for the job. Also I have an update for this topic we added one server after reporting issue and job running with no problem on the new one.

 

Name of the new server: USNH10WS024

 

Name of the issued servers: VNBH01WS4003, VNBH01WS4004, VNBH01WS4005

 

Thank you

Jakub

 

S pozdravom/Best regards

Jakub,

If you right click on the failing job, it should have an option to open the logs for it. If that doesn't work - please use this article to locate the logs: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Maintenance/Troubleshooting.htm

Hello Ilya,

 

Sorry for delay, I am struggling to find option to generate scan logs. See screens. I will need additional help how to gather logs.

Jakub,

Could you please send me the scan logs? Right click the scan job and it should have a link to logs there.

Hello Ilya,

 

Scan on the other servers working with no problem. Yesterday we added new server and the issue is same on the new one as well.

 

Thank you

Does the scan without these hosts work normally?
