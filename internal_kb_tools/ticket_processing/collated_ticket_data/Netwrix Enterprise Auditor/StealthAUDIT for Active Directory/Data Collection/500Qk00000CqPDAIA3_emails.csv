Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support. Which report are you looking at for the changes? It should show up under the 2-AD_Changes job, either the AD_Changes_AttributeChange_Details view or the Attribute Changes report if you're seeing it on the ExtendedAttributesPivotView.

As for the warnings on the ADI Scan, they shouldn't affect anything: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000000divKAA.html

Thank you,

Hi Tay!

ðŸ˜ƒ I started writing out a step by step of what I was doing, SURE that I was going to show you where it was brokenâ€¦  and realized that itâ€™s working now.  Not really sure what the heck was going on yesterday.  I think either I didnâ€™t set the scan back to differential after adding the attributes or I simply missed running the Ad Changes job?  Who knows.

But easy win for ya!  Please resolve the ticket as PEBKAC  with my thanks.

At the very least, nice â€œ talkinâ€™ â€œ to ya!
