Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. I am Saqib and I am happy to assist you with this case.

Please note that the AD_ServiceAccounts job determines if an account is a service account by checking if there is a service principal name (Service principal names - Win32 apps | Microsoft Learn) registered/associated with an account.

Moreover, there is a pre-requisite for this job to be successful. You need to make sure that 1-AD_Scan Job job collects the servicePrincipalName & msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attributes (viewable in the ADI Query Settings > Custom Attributes).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Have a great day!

Saqib Sharif
Technical Support Engineer
