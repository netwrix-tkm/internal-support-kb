Hi Vinay, thank you for your time on meeting today, today we've reviewed the issue status.

We've reviewed troubled hostlists:

1. GRM_AD_APPLICATIONS hostlist is working as intended, we've compared host count to AD host count for target OU, it matches.

2. GRM_AD_AZURE - doesn't have hosts, on attempt to run query manually - insufficient permissions error - please check with your team to resolve this. Once we'll get this working we can check if hosts are picked up correctly or not.

3. GRM_AD_EMEA - correct number of hosts, but no details for collected hosts, we've disabled clean up job and ran query manually, waiting for results.

So far the only issue left is with hostlists that collect hostnames and count, but do not collect details - example - GRM_AD_EMEA hostlist, lets review GRM_AD_EMEA scan results and escalate if needed.

You can book another meeting with me, using same link.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin
Support Engineer EMEA
