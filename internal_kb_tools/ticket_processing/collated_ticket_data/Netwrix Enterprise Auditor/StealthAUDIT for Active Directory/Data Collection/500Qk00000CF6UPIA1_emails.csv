Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support. 

The ADI scan doesn't perform any change operations, just Read and List as outlined here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryInventory/Overview.htm

Are you seeing any 5136 (Directory Service Change) events that coincide with the 4662 events? Otherwise, I would recommend checking if the ""Directory Service Access"" subcategory of the audit policy is enabled as this will log the read only accesses on AD objects as 4662 events.

Thank you,

Hi Tay,

Thanks for the super quick response!! Really good info. I’ll relay the 5136 question to my security team which brought up the 4662 to me. I’ll check back with you once I get more information on my side.

Thanks again

Regards,
Michael

Hi Tay,

Would you happen to know if ADI is supposed to perform DCSYNC activities? That’s basically what is getting captured from the logs when my ADI service account was flagged.

I did also notice ADI had a failure in connectionstatus as well

Hi Tay,

Do you think it might be due to stealthbits trying to use the wrong AD account (from the connection profile) to the DC?

Would I be able to split up the ADI scan into 2 jobs,
One using ADsvc_wsuda01p to scan AD domain controller
One using UBOC-ADsvc_wsuda01p to scan UBOC-AD domain controller

That way we can stop using this connection profile that has both accounts in it?

That could definitely be causing that event! There's no issues splitting the ADI scan, you'll just need to create a custom host list with a DC for each domain. And then you can assign them their respective credentials and host list.

If you'd like to set up a meeting to get that set up, let me know and I'd be happy to send a scheduling link!

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

	Duplicated the 1-AD_Scan in the Active Directory Inventory job group
	Set one scan to use the MUFG host list and connection profile
	Set one scan to use the UBOC host list and connection profile
	Left the 2-AD_Changes and 3-AD_Exceptions jobs as they are since they aren't querying any data, just analyzing what is already in the database

At the end of our session, we kicked off the ADI job group, let me know how things look after the scan!

Thank you,

Hi Tay,

For this windows audit security event, our team came back with the results and I figured out what it was.

The weak passwords job was triggering the issue, once disabled it then it’s no longer flagging. Thanks for the help as always

Michael

Hey Michael,

That could definitely be causing that event! There's no issues splitting the ADI scan, you'll just need to create a custom host list with a DC for each domain. And then you can assign them their respective credentials and host list.

If you'd like to set up a meeting to get that set up, let me know and I'd be happy to send a scheduling link!

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000CF6UP:ref


Hi Tay,

Do you think it might be due to stealthbits trying to use the wrong AD account (from the connection profile) to the DC?

Would I be able to split up the ADI scan into 2 jobs,
One using ADsvc_wsuda01p to scan AD domain controller
One using UBOC-ADsvc_wsuda01p to scan UBOC-AD domain controller

That way we can stop using this connection profile that has both accounts in it?

Hi Tay,

Would you happen to know if ADI is supposed to perform DCSYNC activities? That’s basically what is getting captured from the logs when my ADI service account was flagged.

I did also notice ADI had a failure in connectionstatus as well

Hi Michael,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support.

The ADI scan doesn't perform any change operations, just Read and List as outlined here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryInventory/Overview.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryInventory/Overview.htm__;!!LAhfwj6O_psYQhU!DLtFPvCjlwr-eH4r24OauiT8Zue2q5hVFzHygqltQvNdbWGWB8BRz1Iczc-VoK2uscDpMh0TVgcihr9Se0RT7UjA$>

Are you seeing any 5136 (Directory Service Change) events that coincide with the 4662 events? Otherwise, I would recommend checking if the ""Directory Service Access"" subcategory of the audit policy is enabled as this will log the read only accesses on AD objects as 4662 events.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hey Michael,

That could definitely be causing that event! There's no issues splitting the ADI scan, you'll just need to create a custom host list with a DC for each domain. And then you can assign them their respective credentials and host list.

If you'd like to set up a meeting to get that set up, let me know and I'd be happy to send a scheduling link!

Thank you,

Hi Tay,

 

Do you think it might be due to stealthbits trying to use the wrong AD account (from the connection profile) to the DC?

 

Would I be able to split up the ADI scan into 2 jobs, 

One using ADsvc_wsuda01p to scan AD domain controller

One using UBOC-ADsvc_wsuda01p to scan UBOC-AD domain controller

 

That way we can stop using this connection profile that has both accounts in it?

Hi Tay,

 

Would you happen to know if ADI is supposed to perform DCSYNC activities? That’s basically what is getting captured from the logs when my ADI service account was flagged.

 

I did also notice ADI had a failure in connectionstatus as well

Hi Michael,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support. 

The ADI scan doesn't perform any change operations, just Read and List as outlined here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryInventory/Overview.htm

Are you seeing any 5136 (Directory Service Change) events that coincide with the 4662 events? Otherwise, I would recommend checking if the ""Directory Service Access"" subcategory of the audit policy is enabled as this will log the read only accesses on AD objects as 4662 events.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri
