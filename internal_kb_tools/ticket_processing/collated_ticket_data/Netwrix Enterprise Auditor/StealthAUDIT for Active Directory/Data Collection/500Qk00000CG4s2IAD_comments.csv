They are not scanning the AD domain in ADI for some reason. Ran the full ADI scan for the AD domain to verify if the computer objects are still marked as deleted or not.

The custom cleanup job looks at ""IsDeleted"" attribute to clean up the discovered hosts from SA_HostMaster_Tbl, and it doesn't function properly, because every time the Host Discovery completes this custom cleanup job deletes the discovered hosts from SA_HostMaster_Tbl because they are marked as deleted, but in reality in the Active Directory - they are not!","0054u000007MeUDAA0","2024-07-22T12:40:08.000Z","2024-07-22T12:40:08.000Z","false","false"

On meeting we've reviewed troubled hostlists:
1. GRM_AD_APPLICATIONS hostlist is working as intended, Vinay was comparing incorrect OU to hostlist query results, we've compared host count to AD host count for target OU, it matches.

2. GRM_AD_AZURE - doesn't have hosts, on attempt to run query manually - insufficient permissions error - Vinay will speak to infra team to resolve this.

3. GRM_AD_EMEA - correct number of hosts, but no details for collected hosts, disabled clean up job and requested to run query manually, waiting for results.

So far the only issue left that might be on our side is hostlist that collects hostnames and count, but doesn't collect details - example - GRM_AD_EMEA hostlist, will clarify and escalate if this is still an issue after manual scan.","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2024-11-04T09:52:21.000Z","2024-11-04T09:52:21.000Z","false","false"

@Michael Burrofato @Helen Randall @Sanjay Meghani @WaitingOnEngineer - Just to update from out of band discussion. I reached out to Damir in teams with a list of questions around how they have host discovery configured and whether it's running on a schedule (and asked for some screenshots of host discovery and their targeted host list for ADI). Also asked about any other downstream impacts beyond just the one host not showing up in ADInventory_ComputersView and asked if we could lower priority if there's nothing else breaking.

@WaitingOnEngineer @Helen Randall Hey Damir, 

We have a work item currently on the backlog to investigate this P3 but it will be a while before we have bandwidth to pull that on. Brandon provided some answers to our previous questions, however, based on the latest communication, I believe Brandon sent some explanations and further questions over to the customer and requested a call to discuss, do we know if that call happened or if there are any further details from the customer?

@Salesforce  Could we possibly get some more information from the customer while we dissect this ticket?:

	 - 	can we get screenshots of the settings for GRM_AD_1DC?
	 - 	details not showing up are because the host was offline at scan time? But can we please run this query after scan and share results?: SELECT * FROM SA_ADInventory_Computers c LEFT JOIN SA_ADInventory_Principals p ON c.PrincipalId = p.Id LEFT JOIN SA_ADInventory_Domains d ON d.Id = p.DomainId LEFT JOIN SA_ADInventory_DistinguishedNames dn ON dn.Id = p.DnId LEFT JOIN SA_ADInventory_DistinguishedNames dnM ON dnM.Id = p.ManagedById
	 - 	enabling ""Perform the first inventory right away for newly discovered hosts""
- stated to be enabled, but no evidence provided: can we confirm this, please?
	 - 	what's their setting for 'Only refresh inventory items older then:'? Can we get a screenshot of settings->Host Inventory?
