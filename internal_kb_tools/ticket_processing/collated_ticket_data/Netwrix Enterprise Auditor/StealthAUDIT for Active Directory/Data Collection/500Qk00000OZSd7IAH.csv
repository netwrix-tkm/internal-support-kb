Thanks!","N/A","The customer wants to identify the criteria used for checking if an account is service account in AD.","Awaiting response from customer if they require any assistance.","Symptom
When you were executing the AD_ServiceAccounts job, you were getting different results as compared to actual number of service accounts present in your Active Directory environment.

Cause
The service accounts not reported in the AD_ServiceAccounts job do not have Service Principal Name (SPN) associated with them.

Resolution
To get all the service accounts from Active Directory, you are suggested to populate SPNs against them manually. However, if you want to have heuristic/behavior analysis for detecting Service Accounts in Active Directory, you are requested to create a feature request (https://community.netwrix.com/c/products/access-analyzer/ideas/97).","Incorrect Configuration - Third-Party Application","Saqib Sharif","Question","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Active Directory","Data Collection","11.6","11.6.0.117","2.9","Closed - Resolved","Baker & McKenzie Global Services LLC","Don Boncodin","2025-04-29T09:12:16.000Z","2025-05-02T07:54:29.000Z"
