Hi Jean,

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?


Thanks and Regards,

Hi Jean,

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday.

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly.

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us.

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.


[cid:image001.png@01DAC7B3.E85F3D00]

Please let me know if you need any further info.


Thank You

Hi Deepthi,

We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5

Thanks,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.

If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.

Hi Jean,

 

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday. 

 

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly. 

 

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us. 

 

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.

 

 



 

 



 

Please let me know if you need any further info. 

 

 


Thank You

LeelaNC

Hi Jean,

 

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

 


And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?

 

 

Thanks and Regards,

Deepthi

Hi Deepthi,
 
We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5

Hi Gerth,

Thank You for your email.

Update on the last upgrade - Ad-hoc job, SDD scans went well but we noticed that jobs couldn't start from the Schedules Tab (Task Scheduler) when scheduling.

Here is the error for the same -


[cid:image001.png@01DAC869.2EFC5120]


Please advise.

Also, for the meeting scheduled on Monday July 1st 10:30 am CST can we plan to take a look at this instead having pre-flight meeting for other two servers, since we need to get this issue resolved before proceeding for other servers.

Appreciate your assistance in this regard.

Thank You

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance ""StealthAudit"" as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Hi Jean,

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday.

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly.

For Deepthi's question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us.

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.

Hi Deepthi,

We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance “StealthAudit” as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)

 


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the  ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

In reviewing the error occurring when attempting to schedule jobs in StealthAUDIT, we found that the local security policy ""Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication "" is enabled and would be the most likely cause for the error. We were able to reproduce the same error message outside of the StealthAUDIT console by creating a scheduled task and attempting to configure to allow the task to run whether the user is logged on or not.

We also observed that historically, scheduled tasks were failing due to a credential error which is caused by this security policy setting not allowing the storage of credentials.

For reference, the following Microsoft discussion outlines the above behavior.

Task Scheduler Error “A specified logon session does not exist”

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance “StealthAudit” as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)

 


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the  ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Hi Jean,

 

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday. 

 

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly. 

 

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us. 

 

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.

 

 



 

 



 

Please let me know if you need any further info. 

 

 


Thank You

LeelaNC

Hi Jean,

 

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

 


And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?

 

 

Thanks and Regards,

Deepthi

Hi Deepthi,
 
We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5
 
Thanks,

Hi Jean,

 

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday. 

 

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly. 

 

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us. 

 

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.

 

 



 

 



 

Please let me know if you need any further info. 

 

 


Thank You

LeelaNC

Hi Jean,

 

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

 


And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?

 

 

Thanks and Regards,

Deepthi

Hi Deepthi,
 
We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5
 
Thanks,

Hi Venkata,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we created a new File System Access job to remove the scan executables and data from that specific host, ""PWSTAP01,"" and execute the Action again. We got the same error: ""Incompatible input database version 2.
Please remember to upload the Action folder to this ticket for review.

Thanks again to both of your for your time during our meeting today.

In reviewing the error occurring when attempting to schedule jobs in StealthAUDIT, we found that the local security policy ""Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication "" is enabled and would be the most likely cause for the error. We were able to reproduce the same error message outside of the StealthAUDIT console by creating a scheduled task and attempting to configure to allow the task to run whether the user is logged on or not.

We also observed that historically, scheduled tasks were failing due to a credential error which is caused by this security policy setting not allowing the storage of credentials.

For reference, the following Microsoft discussion outlines the above behavior.

Task Scheduler Error “A specified logon session does not exist”<https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-performance-team/task-scheduler-error-8220-a-specified-logon-session-does-not/ba-p/375056>


Please use the link below to schedule a meeting for the preflight of the next console upgrade.

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance “StealthAudit” as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Can you move that folder from the server to your local computer and try to upload it from there?
If you try to upload, nothing happens. There could be some restrictions on your side; therefore, moving it to a different computer (an unrestricted computer) will allow you to upload the file to our site.

Hi Venkata,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we created a new File System Access job to remove the scan executables and data from that specific host, ""PWSTAP01,"" and execute the Action again. We got the same error: ""Incompatible input database version 2.
Please remember to upload the Action folder to this ticket for review.

Thanks again to both of your for your time during our meeting today.

In reviewing the error occurring when attempting to schedule jobs in StealthAUDIT, we found that the local security policy ""Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication "" is enabled and would be the most likely cause for the error. We were able to reproduce the same error message outside of the StealthAUDIT console by creating a scheduled task and attempting to configure to allow the task to run whether the user is logged on or not.

We also observed that historically, scheduled tasks were failing due to a credential error which is caused by this security policy setting not allowing the storage of credentials.

For reference, the following Microsoft discussion outlines the above behavior.

Task Scheduler Error “A specified logon session does not exist”


Please use the link below to schedule a meeting for the preflight of the next console upgrade.

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance “StealthAudit” as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)

 


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the  ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Hi Jean,

 

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday. 

 

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly. 

 

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us. 

 

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.

 

 



 

 



 

Please let me know if you need any further info. 

 

 


Thank You

LeelaNC

Hi Jean,

 

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

 


And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?

 

 

Thanks and Regards,

Deepthi

Hi Deepthi,
 
We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5
 
Thanks,

Can you move that folder from the server to your local computer and try to upload it from there?
If you try to upload, nothing happens. There could be some restrictions on your side; therefore, moving it to a different computer (an unrestricted computer) will allow you to upload the file to our site.

Thanks,

Hi Venkata,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we created a new File System Access job to remove the scan executables and data from that specific host, ""PWSTAP01,"" and execute the Action again. We got the same error: ""Incompatible input database version 2.
Please remember to upload the Action folder to this ticket for review.

Thanks,

Thanks again to both of your for your time during our meeting today.

In reviewing the error occurring when attempting to schedule jobs in StealthAUDIT, we found that the local security policy ""Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication "" is enabled and would be the most likely cause for the error. We were able to reproduce the same error message outside of the StealthAUDIT console by creating a scheduled task and attempting to configure to allow the task to run whether the user is logged on or not.

We also observed that historically, scheduled tasks were failing due to a credential error which is caused by this security policy setting not allowing the storage of credentials.

For reference, the following Microsoft discussion outlines the above behavior.

Task Scheduler Error “A specified logon session does not exist”<https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-performance-team/task-scheduler-error-8220-a-specified-logon-session-does-not/ba-p/375056>


Please use the link below to schedule a meeting for the preflight of the next console upgrade.

Thanks Leela, I would not worry about sending over the logs at this time. That error about the schema mismatch will highly likely be resolved after upgrading.

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance “StealthAudit” as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Hi Jean,

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday.

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly.

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us.

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.


[cid:image001.jpg@01DAD11F.F44DED30]


[cid:image002.jpg@01DAD11F.F44DED30]

Please let me know if you need any further info.


Thank You

Hi Jean,

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?


Thanks and Regards,
Deepthi

Hi Deepthi,

We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5

Thanks,

Hi Deepthi,
 
Can you move that folder from the server to your local computer and try to upload it from there?
If you try to upload, nothing happens. There could be some restrictions on your side; therefore, moving it to a different computer (an unrestricted computer) will allow you to upload the file to our site.
 
Thanks,

Hi Venkata,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we created a new File System Access job to remove the scan executables and data from that specific host, ""PWSTAP01,"" and execute the Action again. We got the same error: ""Incompatible input database version 2.
Please remember to upload the Action folder to this ticket for review.

Thanks again to both of your for your time during our meeting today.

In reviewing the error occurring when attempting to schedule jobs in StealthAUDIT, we found that the local security policy ""Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication "" is enabled and would be the most likely cause for the error. We were able to reproduce the same error message outside of the StealthAUDIT console by creating a scheduled task and attempting to configure to allow the task to run whether the user is logged on or not.

We also observed that historically, scheduled tasks were failing due to a credential error which is caused by this security policy setting not allowing the storage of credentials.

For reference, the following Microsoft discussion outlines the above behavior.

Task Scheduler Error “A specified logon session does not exist”


Please use the link below to schedule a meeting for the preflight of the next console upgrade.

Thanks Leela, I would not worry about sending over the logs at this time. That error about the schema mismatch will highly likely be resolved after upgrading.

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance “StealthAudit” as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)

 


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the  ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Hi Jean,

 

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday. 

 

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly. 

 

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us. 

 

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.

 

 



 

 



 

Please let me know if you need any further info. 

 

 


Thank You

LeelaNC

Hi Jean,

 

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

 


And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?

 

 

Thanks and Regards,

Deepthi

Hi Deepthi,
 
We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5
 
Thanks,

Hi Deepthi,

If you think the file is too big for your network to process, try splitting it with 7-zip. Once we receive it, we can put it together. Would you like to try that?

Hi Venkata,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we created a new File System Access job to remove the scan executables and data from that specific host, ""PWSTAP01,"" and execute the Action again. We got the same error: ""Incompatible input database version 2.
Please remember to upload the Action folder to this ticket for review.

Thanks,

Thanks again to both of your for your time during our meeting today.

In reviewing the error occurring when attempting to schedule jobs in StealthAUDIT, we found that the local security policy ""Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication "" is enabled and would be the most likely cause for the error. We were able to reproduce the same error message outside of the StealthAUDIT console by creating a scheduled task and attempting to configure to allow the task to run whether the user is logged on or not.

We also observed that historically, scheduled tasks were failing due to a credential error which is caused by this security policy setting not allowing the storage of credentials.

For reference, the following Microsoft discussion outlines the above behavior.

Task Scheduler Error “A specified logon session does not exist”<https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-performance-team/task-scheduler-error-8220-a-specified-logon-session-does-not/ba-p/375056>


Please use the link below to schedule a meeting for the preflight of the next console upgrade.

Thanks Leela, I would not worry about sending over the logs at this time. That error about the schema mismatch will highly likely be resolved after upgrading.

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance “StealthAudit” as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Hi Jean,

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday.

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly.

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us.

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.

[cid:image002.jpg@01DAD231.56D4D470]

Please let me know if you need any further info.


Thank You

Hi Jean,

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?


Thanks and Regards,
Deepthi

Hi Deepthi,

We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5

Thanks,

Hi Deepthi,

If you think the file is too big for your network to process, try splitting it with 7-zip. Once we receive it, we can put it together. Would you like to try that?

Thanks,

Hi Deepthi,

Can you move that folder from the server to your local computer and try to upload it from there?
If you try to upload, nothing happens. There could be some restrictions on your side; therefore, moving it to a different computer (an unrestricted computer) will allow you to upload the file to our site.

Thanks,

Hi Venkata,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we created a new File System Access job to remove the scan executables and data from that specific host, ""PWSTAP01,"" and execute the Action again. We got the same error: ""Incompatible input database version 2.
Please remember to upload the Action folder to this ticket for review.

Thanks again to both of your for your time during our meeting today.

In reviewing the error occurring when attempting to schedule jobs in StealthAUDIT, we found that the local security policy ""Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication "" is enabled and would be the most likely cause for the error. We were able to reproduce the same error message outside of the StealthAUDIT console by creating a scheduled task and attempting to configure to allow the task to run whether the user is logged on or not.

We also observed that historically, scheduled tasks were failing due to a credential error which is caused by this security policy setting not allowing the storage of credentials.

For reference, the following Microsoft discussion outlines the above behavior.

Task Scheduler Error “A specified logon session does not exist”<https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-performance-team/task-scheduler-error-8220-a-specified-logon-session-does-not/ba-p/375056>


Please use the link below to schedule a meeting for the preflight of the next console upgrade.

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance “StealthAudit” as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Hi Jean,

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday.

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly.

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us.

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.


[cid:image001.jpg@01DAD379.1DD6A240]


[cid:image002.jpg@01DAD379.1DD6A240]

Please let me know if you need any further info.


Thank You

Hi Jean,

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?

Hi Deepthi,

We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5

Thanks,

Hi Deepthi,
 
If you think the file is too big for your network to process, try splitting it with 7-zip. Once we receive it, we can put it together. Would you like to try that?

Hi Deepthi,
 
Can you move that folder from the server to your local computer and try to upload it from there?
If you try to upload, nothing happens. There could be some restrictions on your side; therefore, moving it to a different computer (an unrestricted computer) will allow you to upload the file to our site.
 
Thanks,

Hi Venkata,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we created a new File System Access job to remove the scan executables and data from that specific host, ""PWSTAP01,"" and execute the Action again. We got the same error: ""Incompatible input database version 2.
Please remember to upload the Action folder to this ticket for review.

Thanks again to both of your for your time during our meeting today.

In reviewing the error occurring when attempting to schedule jobs in StealthAUDIT, we found that the local security policy ""Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication "" is enabled and would be the most likely cause for the error. We were able to reproduce the same error message outside of the StealthAUDIT console by creating a scheduled task and attempting to configure to allow the task to run whether the user is logged on or not.

We also observed that historically, scheduled tasks were failing due to a credential error which is caused by this security policy setting not allowing the storage of credentials.

For reference, the following Microsoft discussion outlines the above behavior.

Task Scheduler Error “A specified logon session does not exist”


Please use the link below to schedule a meeting for the preflight of the next console upgrade.

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance “StealthAudit” as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)

 


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the  ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Hi Jean,

 

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday. 

 

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly. 

 

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us. 

 

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.

 

 



 

 



 

Please let me know if you need any further info. 

 

 


Thank You

LeelaNC

Hi Jean,

 

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

 


And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?

 

 

Thanks and Regards,

Deepthi

Hi Deepthi,
 
We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5

Thank you for the follow up Deepthi. Frantz was out of the office today, however it does appear that he was able to download the artifacts and attach them to the support ticket. I will make a note to follow up with him so he can provide you with specific confirmation.

Hi Deepthi,

If you think the file is too big for your network to process, try splitting it with 7-zip. Once we receive it, we can put it together. Would you like to try that?

Hi Deepthi,

Can you move that folder from the server to your local computer and try to upload it from there?
If you try to upload, nothing happens. There could be some restrictions on your side; therefore, moving it to a different computer (an unrestricted computer) will allow you to upload the file to our site.

Thanks,

Hi Venkata,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we created a new File System Access job to remove the scan executables and data from that specific host, ""PWSTAP01,"" and execute the Action again. We got the same error: ""Incompatible input database version 2.
Please remember to upload the Action folder to this ticket for review.

Thanks,

Thanks again to both of your for your time during our meeting today.

In reviewing the error occurring when attempting to schedule jobs in StealthAUDIT, we found that the local security policy ""Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication "" is enabled and would be the most likely cause for the error. We were able to reproduce the same error message outside of the StealthAUDIT console by creating a scheduled task and attempting to configure to allow the task to run whether the user is logged on or not.

We also observed that historically, scheduled tasks were failing due to a credential error which is caused by this security policy setting not allowing the storage of credentials.

For reference, the following Microsoft discussion outlines the above behavior.

Task Scheduler Error ""A specified logon session does not exist""<https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-performance-team/task-scheduler-error-8220-a-specified-logon-session-does-not/ba-p/375056>


Please use the link below to schedule a meeting for the preflight of the next console upgrade.

Thanks Leela, I would not worry about sending over the logs at this time. That error about the schema mismatch will highly likely be resolved after upgrading.

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance ""StealthAudit"" as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Hi Jean,

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday.

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly.

For Deepthi's question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us.

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.


[cid:image001.jpg@01DAD696.A778C800]


[cid:image002.jpg@01DAD696.A778C800]

Please let me know if you need any further info.


Thank You

Hi Jean,

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?


Thanks and Regards,
Deepthi

Hi Deepthi,

We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5

Thanks,

Hi Deepthi,
 
If you think the file is too big for your network to process, try splitting it with 7-zip. Once we receive it, we can put it together. Would you like to try that?

Hi Deepthi,
 
Can you move that folder from the server to your local computer and try to upload it from there?
If you try to upload, nothing happens. There could be some restrictions on your side; therefore, moving it to a different computer (an unrestricted computer) will allow you to upload the file to our site.
 
Thanks,

Hi Venkata,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we created a new File System Access job to remove the scan executables and data from that specific host, ""PWSTAP01,"" and execute the Action again. We got the same error: ""Incompatible input database version 2.
Please remember to upload the Action folder to this ticket for review.
 
Thanks,

Thanks again to both of your for your time during our meeting today.

In reviewing the error occurring when attempting to schedule jobs in StealthAUDIT, we found that the local security policy ""Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication "" is enabled and would be the most likely cause for the error. We were able to reproduce the same error message outside of the StealthAUDIT console by creating a scheduled task and attempting to configure to allow the task to run whether the user is logged on or not.

We also observed that historically, scheduled tasks were failing due to a credential error which is caused by this security policy setting not allowing the storage of credentials.

For reference, the following Microsoft discussion outlines the above behavior.

Task Scheduler Error “A specified logon session does not exist”


Please use the link below to schedule a meeting for the preflight of the next console upgrade.

Thanks Leela, I would not worry about sending over the logs at this time. That error about the schema mismatch will highly likely be resolved after upgrading.

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance “StealthAudit” as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)

 


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the  ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Hi Jean,

 

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday. 

 

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly. 

 

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us. 

 

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.

 

 



 

 



 

Please let me know if you need any further info. 

 

 


Thank You

LeelaNC

Hi Jean,

 

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

 


And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?

 

 

Thanks and Regards,

Deepthi

Hi Deepthi,
 
We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5
 
Thanks,

Hi Deepthi,

If you think the file is too big for your network to process, try splitting it with 7-zip. Once we receive it, we can put it together. Would you like to try that?

Hi Deepthi,

Can you move that folder from the server to your local computer and try to upload it from there?
If you try to upload, nothing happens. There could be some restrictions on your side; therefore, moving it to a different computer (an unrestricted computer) will allow you to upload the file to our site.

Thanks,

Hi Venkata,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we created a new File System Access job to remove the scan executables and data from that specific host, ""PWSTAP01,"" and execute the Action again. We got the same error: ""Incompatible input database version 2.
Please remember to upload the Action folder to this ticket for review.

Thanks again to both of your for your time during our meeting today.

In reviewing the error occurring when attempting to schedule jobs in StealthAUDIT, we found that the local security policy ""Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network authentication "" is enabled and would be the most likely cause for the error. We were able to reproduce the same error message outside of the StealthAUDIT console by creating a scheduled task and attempting to configure to allow the task to run whether the user is logged on or not.

We also observed that historically, scheduled tasks were failing due to a credential error which is caused by this security policy setting not allowing the storage of credentials.

For reference, the following Microsoft discussion outlines the above behavior.

Task Scheduler Error “A specified logon session does not exist”<https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ask-the-performance-team/task-scheduler-error-8220-a-specified-logon-session-does-not/ba-p/375056>


Please use the link below to schedule a meeting for the preflight of the next console upgrade.

Hello Leela,

Frantz is currently out of the office so I included a scheduling link below for performing a preflight.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=B8T3R9sIIQ6rLG1_BzaGZEIBg5rdV6QWo3pJ2KyN06U-Z&MeetingID=AqgwrYfMWncwno6mnLxJR4engFcqZF3tKHWcOUvwSsI-Z


I also wanted to inquire is the security server where you are receiving the database schema error using the same database as the recently upgraded StealthAUDIT 11.5 instance? That would explain the error message as they would have different database schemas and running different versions against the same database would not be supported.
Yes, the security server is using the same database instance “StealthAudit” as the recently upgraded server (to SA v11.5)


If both consoles are on the same build, could you please zip up the ""<drive>Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsApplication"" folder and attach to the ticket.
No, both consoles are not on the same build, do you still want me to zip up and attach Application folder. Please let me know.

Hi Jean,

We are still in the process of performing post upgrade validation to the production servers from last Friday.

Sorry for the delay, will keep you posted once the validation has completed successfully and we can close the ticket accordingly.

For Deepthi’s question, as you know we have two more production servers where SA console is installed (and needs upgrade to v11.5) and the proxy server in synch, should we go for pre-flight meeting for them in the meantime if your schedule permits for this week Thursday or Friday or else early next week. Could you please share your calendar availability with Deepthi or us.

And the issue we are facing with our security server (as below) is unable to initialize the database schema, please find below screenshots for the version installed and the error message which pops up when the SA console is opened. Could you please advise on this if the upgrade from our last Friday has any impact to the below server.

Please let me know if you need any further info.


Thank You

Hi Jean,

We are facing this issue on Security Application server(PWCBDP02) which is having older version. Shall we have pre-flight meeting to check on the upgrade of this server?

And also we have Document Archive Minneapolis Proxy Server (AWSTAP02) which is pending for upgrade.Is it possible to go with both servers in one go?


Thanks and Regards,
Deepthi

Hi Deepthi,

We sent you a meeting invite from ticket 00396923, which is a follow-up because of the issue with the task scheduler.
For this ticket, you mention ""Unable to run an AD inventory report on security server."" Which server is that? Is it different from the one we upgraded?
The error message shows 11.0, not 11.5

Thanks,
