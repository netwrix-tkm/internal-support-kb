Hello Jason,

I wanted to follow up after our recent online meeting to see how things are going. I haven’t heard from you since our last discussion and wanted to check if you were able to make progress on the items we talked about or if you still need assistance.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further support—I’m here to help!

Looking forward to your response.

Ticket Number: 00435749
Ticket Subject: AD_ActivityCollection Job
Ticket Details: When running the AD_ActivityCollection job it is failing with access denied error. We have checked the documents about setting this up and we think it is setup correctly
Requires Netwrix Activity Monitor (SAM) API Access
Requires Read access to the SAM Log Archive location

We are not sure why this is failing

Thank you!

Thank you for your time and patience on this issue and I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved for you. 
The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Issue:
AD_ActivityCollection job is failing with access denied error.

Cause:
The AD_ActivityCollection job was not setup to import Activity Monitor logs correctly. it was instead trying to import from itself which would not work.

Resolution:
Reconfigured the job to import Activity Monitor logs and process correctly.

At this time I will be closing your ticket out for you. This case can be re-opened at any time if any related issues return. 
Please feel free to reach out to the Netwrix team if you have any additional questions or would like assistance with any issues. Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case has been closed.
