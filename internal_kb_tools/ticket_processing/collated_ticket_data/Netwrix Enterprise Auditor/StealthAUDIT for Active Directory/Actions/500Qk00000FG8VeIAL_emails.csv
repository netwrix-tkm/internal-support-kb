Hello

 

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)  

 

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

 



 

 

I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

 

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

 

Thanks

 

James

James,

Yes, this will require re-scanning, as it's going to look for tags in files and their metadata.

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

[cid:image002.png@01DB3443.63735E80]


I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

Thanks

James

Yes, this will require re-scanning, as it's going to look for tags in files and their metadata.

Just to say that I deleted the NewData1.csv (I was curious!) and somehow the criteria have reverted to the list shown.  Not sure why.

James,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.


[cid:image007.png@01DB34DF.509AB870]

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

James

James,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

[cid:image001.png@01DB34DF.087861A0]


I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

Thanks

James

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000FG8Ve:ref


Hello

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.


[cid:image001.png@01DB34F3.587FF640]

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

[cid:image002.png@01DB34F3.587FF640]


I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

Thanks

James

Yes, this will require re-scanning, as it's going to look for tags in files and their metadata.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

 

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)  

 

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

 



 

 

I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

 

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

 

Thanks

 

James

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

Hello

 

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

 

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

 

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.  

 

 



 

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

 

James

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

Hello

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.


[cid:image003.png@01DB34F7.FFB28E60]

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

James,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

[cid:image004.png@01DB34F7.FFB28E60]


I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

Thanks

James

Yes, this will require re-scanning, as it's going to look for tags in files and their metadata.

Hello

 

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)  

 

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

 



 

 

I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

 

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

 

Thanks

 

James

Hello Ilya

I am making progress but it seems whatever is trying to write the tags (and indeed read them from files during the scan does not have the right permissions.

I see this in the action log:

16:17:11.371499 Debug Tag Type is: 1
16:17:11.381526 Debug Error reading core properties from file
16:17:11.382529 Debug Failed to get tags of '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: The system cannot open the device or file specified
16:17:11.383531 Debug Error getting keywords for \S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew<file://S-UKAPRE-EFR01P/N$/DATA/Departments/IT/New> Microsoft Word Document.docx;The system cannot open the device or file specified
16:17:11.384534 Debug Failed to process '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN:DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: Failed to open file as specified type
16:17:11.384534 Debug Tag Type is: 1

And in the FSAA messages I see millions (literally)  of messages  similar to:

[cid:image010.png@01DB35A6.B2528F80]

I don’t understand why the sensitive data scan can read the files to find keywords  but since we enable the additional read file metadata  it is unable to do that.

Please can you advise or point me to the right guidance on your website?

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

Hello

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.


[cid:image003.png@01DB35A6.7FEEC7C0]

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

You need to ensure that these files can be read AND modified (for metadata alteration purposes) by the service account in use. This can be checked with Effective Access feature of the file's Security settings.

As for permissions please check these articles:

Hello Ilya

 

I am making progress but it seems whatever is trying to write the tags (and indeed read them from files during the scan does not have the right permissions.

 

I see this in the action log:

 

16:17:11.371499 Debug Tag Type is: 1

16:17:11.381526 Debug Error reading core properties from file

16:17:11.382529 Debug Failed to get tags of '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: The system cannot open the device or file specified

16:17:11.383531 Debug Error getting keywords for \S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx;The system cannot open the device or file specified

16:17:11.384534 Debug Tag Type is: 1

 

And in the FSAA messages I see millions (literally)  of messages  similar to:

 



 

I don’t understand why the sensitive data scan can read the files to find keywords  but since we enable the additional read file metadata  it is unable to do that.

 

Please can you advise or point me to the right guidance on your website?

 

James

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

Hello

 

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

 

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

 

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.  

 

 



 

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

 

James

James,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

 

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)  

 

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

 



 

 

I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

 

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

 

Thanks

 

James

Yes, this will require re-scanning, as it's going to look for tags in files and their metadata.

Thanks Ilya -  I will check that.  I can see that would affect being able to write the new tag.

But do you have any idea why we get 3 million file access errors on FSAA  job now?

[cid:image011.png@01DB35BA.A0F74370]

My assumption is that enabling File tag metadata collection in the FSAA job would only require read access – the same as it already has for discovering keywords in the file?  Maybe that’s not right?

James,

You need to ensure that these files can be read AND modified (for metadata alteration purposes) by the service account in use. This can be checked with Effective Access feature of the file's Security settings.

As for permissions please check these articles:

Hello Ilya

I am making progress but it seems whatever is trying to write the tags (and indeed read them from files during the scan does not have the right permissions.

I see this in the action log:

16:17:11.371499 Debug Tag Type is: 1
16:17:11.381526 Debug Error reading core properties from file
16:17:11.382529 Debug Failed to get tags of '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: The system cannot open the device or file specified
16:17:11.383531 Debug Error getting keywords for \S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx;The system cannot open the device or file specified
16:17:11.384534 Debug Failed to process '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN:DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: Failed to open file as specified type
16:17:11.384534 Debug Tag Type is: 1

And in the FSAA messages I see millions (literally)  of messages  similar to:

[cid:image001.png@01DB35B9.EB80A4A0]

I don’t understand why the sensitive data scan can read the files to find keywords  but since we enable the additional read file metadata  it is unable to do that.

Please can you advise or point me to the right guidance on your website?

James

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000FG8Ve:ref


Hello

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.


[cid:image004.png@01DB35B9.EB80A4A0]

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

James,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

[cid:image005.png@01DB35B9.EB80A4A0]


I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

Thanks

James

Thanks Ilya -  I will check that.  I can see that would affect being able to write the new tag.

 

But do you have any idea why we get 3 million file access errors on FSAA  job now?

 



 

My assumption is that enabling File tag metadata collection in the FSAA job would only require read access – the same as it already has for discovering keywords in the file?  Maybe that’s not right?

You need to ensure that these files can be read AND modified (for metadata alteration purposes) by the service account in use. This can be checked with Effective Access feature of the file's Security settings.

Hello Ilya

 

I am making progress but it seems whatever is trying to write the tags (and indeed read them from files during the scan does not have the right permissions.

 

I see this in the action log:

 

16:17:11.371499 Debug Tag Type is: 1

16:17:11.381526 Debug Error reading core properties from file

16:17:11.382529 Debug Failed to get tags of '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: The system cannot open the device or file specified

16:17:11.383531 Debug Error getting keywords for \S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx;The system cannot open the device or file specified

16:17:11.384534 Debug Failed to process '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN:DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: Failed to open file as specified type

16:17:11.384534 Debug Tag Type is: 1

 

And in the FSAA messages I see millions (literally)  of messages  similar to:

 



 

I don’t understand why the sensitive data scan can read the files to find keywords  but since we enable the additional read file metadata  it is unable to do that.

 

Please can you advise or point me to the right guidance on your website?

 

James

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

Hello

 

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

 

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

 

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.  

 

 



 

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

 

James

James,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

 

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)  

 

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

 



 

 

I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

 

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

 

Thanks

 

James

Thanks Ilya -  I will check that.  I can see that would affect being able to write the new tag.

But do you have any idea why we get 3 million file access errors on FSAA  job now?

[cid:image001.png@01DB35C4.181B0E10]

My assumption is that enabling File tag metadata collection in the FSAA job would only require read access – the same as it already has for discovering keywords in the file?  Maybe that’s not right?

Hello Ilya

I am making progress but it seems whatever is trying to write the tags (and indeed read them from files during the scan does not have the right permissions.

I see this in the action log:

16:17:11.371499 Debug Tag Type is: 1
16:17:11.381526 Debug Error reading core properties from file
16:17:11.382529 Debug Failed to get tags of '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: The system cannot open the device or file specified
16:17:11.383531 Debug Error getting keywords for \S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx;The system cannot open the device or file specified
16:17:11.384534 Debug Failed to process '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN:DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: Failed to open file as specified type
16:17:11.384534 Debug Tag Type is: 1

And in the FSAA messages I see millions (literally)  of messages  similar to:

[cid:image002.png@01DB35C4.181B0E10]

I don’t understand why the sensitive data scan can read the files to find keywords  but since we enable the additional read file metadata  it is unable to do that.

Please can you advise or point me to the right guidance on your website?

James

Ilya

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000FG8Ve:ref


Hello

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.


[cid:image005.png@01DB35C4.181B0E10]

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

James,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

[cid:image006.png@01DB35C4.181B0E10]


I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

Thanks

James

Yes, this will require re-scanning, as it's going to look for tags in files and their metadata.

Hello Ilya

I am making progress but it seems whatever is trying to write the tags (and indeed read them from files during the scan does not have the right permissions.

I see this in the action log:

16:17:11.371499 Debug Tag Type is: 1
16:17:11.381526 Debug Error reading core properties from file
16:17:11.382529 Debug Failed to get tags of '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: The system cannot open the device or file specified
16:17:11.383531 Debug Error getting keywords for \S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx;The system cannot open the device or file specified
16:17:11.384534 Debug Failed to process '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN:DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: Failed to open file as specified type
16:17:11.384534 Debug Tag Type is: 1

And in the FSAA messages I see millions (literally)  of messages  similar to:

[cid:image001.png@01DB35CD.0950CE20]

I don’t understand why the sensitive data scan can read the files to find keywords  but since we enable the additional read file metadata  it is unable to do that.

Please can you advise or point me to the right guidance on your website?

James

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000FG8Ve:ref


Hello

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.


[cid:image004.png@01DB35CD.0950CE20]

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

James,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

[cid:image005.png@01DB35CD.0950CE20]


I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

Thanks

James

Yes, this will require re-scanning, as it's going to look for tags in files and their metadata.

They both state generally the same required permissions:
 
The Netwrix Activity Monitor must have an Activity Agent deployed on the Windows file server to be monitored. While actively monitoring, the Activity Agent generates activity log files stored on the server. The credential used to deploy the Activity Agent must have the following permissions on the server:


	
	Membership in the local Administrators group
	
	
	READ and WRITE access to the archive location for Archiving feature only
	


It is also necessary to enable the Remote Registry Service on the Activity Agent server.

For integration between the Activity Monitor and Enterprise Auditor, the credential used by Enterprise Auditor to read the activity log files must have also have this permission

Please attach the screenshots of one of the files affected with it's Effective Access permissions visible.

Those links do not provide the permissions required  but just refer back to each other.  Do you have a link to the specific case you have seen for our setup?

James,

You need to ensure that these files can be read AND modified (for metadata alteration purposes) by the service account in use. This can be checked with Effective Access feature of the file's Security settings.

As for permissions please check these articles: 
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/Config/WindowsFile/Overview.htm

Hello Ilya

 

I am making progress but it seems whatever is trying to write the tags (and indeed read them from files during the scan does not have the right permissions.

 

I see this in the action log:

 

16:17:11.371499 Debug Tag Type is: 1

16:17:11.381526 Debug Error reading core properties from file

16:17:11.382529 Debug Failed to get tags of '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: The system cannot open the device or file specified

16:17:11.383531 Debug Error getting keywords for \S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx;The system cannot open the device or file specified

16:17:11.384534 Debug Failed to process '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN:DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: Failed to open file as specified type

16:17:11.384534 Debug Tag Type is: 1

 

And in the FSAA messages I see millions (literally)  of messages  similar to:

 



 

I don’t understand why the sensitive data scan can read the files to find keywords  but since we enable the additional read file metadata  it is unable to do that.

 

Please can you advise or point me to the right guidance on your website?

 

James

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

Hello

 

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

 

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

 

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.  

 

 



 

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

 

James

James,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

 

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)  

 

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

 



 

 

I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

 

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

 

Thanks

 

James

The screenshot  you asked for:

[cid:image011.png@01DB35DA.C5E678C0]

[cid:image012.png@01DB35DB.229BFE00]





This is the bit I saw  and the Permissions vary  part made me click the link  which then takes you to a page which links back to the first page!
Access & Sensitive Data Auditing Permissions

  *   Permissions vary based on the Scan Mode Option selected. See the File System Supported Platforms<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/FileSystems.htm> topic for additional information.

The part below it is the part you have sent  which I have checked and seen is set correctly.

I have removed the option we set the other day and re-run the job to see that the fsaa job returns to how it was before.  I will then create a new ticket if necessary.

James,

They both state generally the same required permissions:


The Netwrix Activity Monitor must have an Activity Agent deployed on the Windows file server to be monitored. While actively monitoring, the Activity Agent generates activity log files stored on the server. The credential used to deploy the Activity Agent must have the following permissions on the server:

  *   Membership in the local Administrators group
  *   READ and WRITE access to the archive location for Archiving feature only

It is also necessary to enable the Remote Registry Service on the Activity Agent server.

For integration between the Activity Monitor and Enterprise Auditor, the credential used by Enterprise Auditor to read the activity log files must have also have this permission

Please attach the screenshots of one of the files affected with it's Effective Access permissions visible.

I don’t understand why the sensitive data scan can read the files to find keywords  but since we enable the additional read file metadata  it is unable to do that.

Please can you advise or point me to the right guidance on your website?

Ilya

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000FG8Ve:ref


Hello

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.


[cid:image004.png@01DB35DA.06C94D00]

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

James,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

[cid:image005.png@01DB35DA.06C94D00]


I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

Thanks

James

Yes, this will require re-scanning, as it's going to look for tags in files and their metadata.

Sounds good. I will now close this ticket, since we have solved the root cause of file tagging.

We applied proper settings, ensured that the data is being reported on and that the tags can be both customized and applied. If this setup causes issues, we'll gladly help you to solve those. If you are logging a ticket please mention in the description that it should go to Ilya Kotov, to speed up the process (since I know quite a lot about the setup we performed so far)

Thank you and have a nice day!

Thanks Ilya -  yes,  the service account has those already.

 

The screenshot  you asked for:

 



 



 

 

 

 

 

This is the bit I saw  and the Permissions vary  part made me click the link  which then takes you to a page which links back to the first page!

Access & Sensitive Data Auditing Permissions


	Permissions vary based on the Scan Mode Option selected. See the File System Supported Platforms topic for additional information.


 

The part below it is the part you have sent  which I have checked and seen is set correctly.

 

I have removed the option we set the other day and re-run the job to see that the fsaa job returns to how it was before.  I will then create a new ticket if necessary.

 

Thanks,

 

James

James,

They both state generally the same required permissions:
 

The Netwrix Activity Monitor must have an Activity Agent deployed on the Windows file server to be monitored. While actively monitoring, the Activity Agent generates activity log files stored on the server. The credential used to deploy the Activity Agent must have the following permissions on the server:


	Membership in the local Administrators group
	READ and WRITE access to the archive location for Archiving feature only


It is also necessary to enable the Remote Registry Service on the Activity Agent server.

For integration between the Activity Monitor and Enterprise Auditor, the credential used by Enterprise Auditor to read the activity log files must have also have this permission

Please attach the screenshots of one of the files affected with it's Effective Access permissions visible.

Those links do not provide the permissions required  but just refer back to each other.  Do you have a link to the specific case you have seen for our setup?

James,

You need to ensure that these files can be read AND modified (for metadata alteration purposes) by the service account in use. This can be checked with Effective Access feature of the file's Security settings.

As for permissions please check these articles:

Hello Ilya

 

I am making progress but it seems whatever is trying to write the tags (and indeed read them from files during the scan does not have the right permissions.

 

I see this in the action log:

 

16:17:11.371499 Debug Tag Type is: 1

16:17:11.381526 Debug Error reading core properties from file

16:17:11.382529 Debug Failed to get tags of '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: The system cannot open the device or file specified

16:17:11.383531 Debug Error getting keywords for \S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN$DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx;The system cannot open the device or file specified

16:17:11.384534 Debug Failed to process '\S-UKAPRE-EFR01PN:DATADepartmentsITNew Microsoft Word Document.docx'. Error: Failed to open file as specified type

16:17:11.384534 Debug Tag Type is: 1

 

And in the FSAA messages I see millions (literally)  of messages  similar to:

 



 

I don’t understand why the sensitive data scan can read the files to find keywords  but since we enable the additional read file metadata  it is unable to do that.

 

Please can you advise or point me to the right guidance on your website?

 

James

Ilya

 

Do you know if that job can add tags that are anything other than SENSITIVE?   I cannot see where I can change the tag to be written to the file.

Hello

 

I had a look through the job config while I was waiting for some changes to take effect last night and found what I think is the solution to my problem.

 

In the analysis, the temp table seems to be configured from the SQL ScriptEditor page -  “edit table”  and by changing the values in there I was able to get the job to do what I need  (except it only seems to create a tag  called SENSITIVE).

 

I think it now works because the config was looking for a file called newdata2.csv and the criteria I choose are in newdata1.csv (as I have shown you).  I changed the filename to newdata1.csv and now it works.  

 

 



 

I will try and find out how to set the tag to something else apart from SENSITIVE  which is not sufficient for our needs and I will let you know how I get on and if I need help.

 

James

James,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we tested your configuration and ensured proper setup of the tags. We've yet to see the results, as there seems to be a discrepancy between set tags and resolved tags. We're continuing the investigation. Please follow the recommendation of restarting the server and checking the job results again and update us.

Current issue: The table we're getting the data from is not getting updated no matter what we do.

Hello

 

The fsaa  job finished (albeit with many messages like  Error 1 parsing tags, Error 80 parsing tags, Error 110 parsing tags)  

 

I re-ran the file tagging job and it still does not show the results for the criteria I entered,  but for the criteria that were originally in the job before I removed them:

 



 

 

I still do not see how the criteria I enter get passed to the job  and it is clear that they are not being otherwise the results would not be like this.

 

Do you have anything further for me to try?  Should I revert the FSAA  job changes you requested I make?

 

Thanks

 

James

Yes, this will require re-scanning, as it's going to look for tags in files and their metadata.
