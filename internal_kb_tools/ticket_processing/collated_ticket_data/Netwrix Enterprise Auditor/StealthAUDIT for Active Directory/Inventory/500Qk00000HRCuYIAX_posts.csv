Before the full collection, we were not able to return the records for the following 4 users:
--
Adam.Martin@baldwin.com
Mike.Grillo@baldwin.com
Alexis.Arredondo
TPAadmin-ryan.oleary
--

+++++
SQL Select:
+++++
Use StealthAUDIT;

select * from StealthAUDIT.dbo.SA_ADInventory_Principals where ObjectClass = 4 and SamAccountName like '%mike.grill%';

2) In NEA, we searched the ""ADInventory_UserView"" using ""DistinguishedName"" from the drop-down
BEFORE the FULL COLLECTION: ""ADInventory_UserView"" - OU=Construction Risk Partners > 130 users are being collected from this OU in NEA ("".Active Directory Inventory"")

3) Then we changed a configuration setting for the ""1-AD_Scan"" Job:

Jobs > "".Active Directory Inventory"" > ""1-AD_Scan"" Job > ""Configure"" > ""Queries"" > 
""Query Properties"" > ""Configure"" button > ""Options"" > UNCHECK ""Collect only updates since the last scan""

This will result in a full collection and refresh instead of an incremental collection.
