"500Qk00000Bg2dPIAR","00411545","Support Ticket","Recreate/Import custom AD Scan Analysis?","Under version 11, we had an analysis created for our AD user summary (for licensing), but it seems to have disappeared in the GUI since our upgrade to 11.5. Max Pibouin is asking for these numbers in the StealthAudit interface. 

I see C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobsGROUP_.Active Directory InventoryJOB_1-AD_Scan<a href='https://VIEW_SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers.INI.xml' target='_blank'>VIEW_SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers.INI.xml</a> still exists in the files, but not sure how to import or recreate it in StealthAudit?","","","","[Issue]
Customer was missing analysis task needed for licensing counts on ADI job post upgrade

[Root Cause]
ADI job was not upgraded in place so it appears to have removed the analysis task

[Resolution]
1. Close all open instances of StealthAUDIT
2. Copy the JOB_1-AD_Scan folder from the archived jobs folder in %SAInstallDir%Jobs to %SAInstallDir%JobsGROUP_.Active Directory Inventory
3. Right-click and verify it's not blocked, and remove the checkbox for ""Read Only""
4. Go to Control Panel, and select ""Change"" then ""Repair"" on StealthAUDIT 
5. Once the repair is complete, you should be able to see the analysis for ""SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers""
