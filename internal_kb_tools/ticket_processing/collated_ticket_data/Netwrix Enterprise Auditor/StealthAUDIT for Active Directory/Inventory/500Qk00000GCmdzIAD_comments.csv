Reason for Escalation: We have determined that this is a windows limitation but the NEA application needs to be able to identify this as a WARNING instead of an ERROR. This would allow for the 1-AD_Scan to fully complete without distrupting the scan entirely.

@Salesforce  @Ethan Israel I was reviewing previous instances of when the ADI Long ACL error came up in the past and saw we had that same issue with another customer two years back. I see the error message indicates which user is giving us an issue: CN=Jake Colon,OU=USERS,OU=IT,DC=internal,DC=hillsclerk,DC=com' 'Length of the access control list exceed the allowed maximum.


Can you ask/confirm with the customer if they are willing to clean up the ACL? We are trying to reproduce this but having difficulty since that ACL is massive and just not practical as per MS best practices due to performance degradation issues.
