Thank you for meeting with me today and sending over those files. I played around with them in my lab and found a pretty easy fix-

	Close all open instances of StealthAUDIT
	Move the %SAInstallDir%JobsGROUP_.Active Directory InventoryJOB_1-AD_Scan to the desktop
	Copy the JOB_1-AD_Scan folder from the Send to Netwrix folder on the desktop to %SAInstallDir%JobsGROUP_.Active Directory Inventory
	Right-click and verify it's not blocked, and remove the checkbox for ""Read Only""
	Go to Control Panel, and select ""Change"" then ""Repair"" on StealthAUDIT 
	Once the repair is complete, you should be able to see the analysis for ""SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers""
