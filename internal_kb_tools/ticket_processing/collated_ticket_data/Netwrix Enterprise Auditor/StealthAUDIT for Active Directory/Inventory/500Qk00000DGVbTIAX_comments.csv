**Current Issue**
The ADInventory_ExtendedAttributesPivotView does not populate. When attempting to view in SSMS we get:
FOR XML could not serialize the data for node 'NoName' because it contains a character (0x0000) which is not allowed in XML. To retrieve this data using FOR XML, convert it to binary, varbinary or image data type and use the BINARY BASE64 directive.

**Troubleshooting Completed during Meeting**
- Verified the 1-AD_Scan job is configured to collect extended attributes
- Full scan is being run (no differential)
- Dropped the view and recreated it-- same error occurs on the new one

- Verified the SA_ADInventory_ExtendedAttributes table populates

Review export of the values to try and find the special character being complained about","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2024-08-06T21:36:39.000Z","2024-08-06T21:36:39.000Z","false","false"

**Problem Statement/Business Impact**
Customer is unable to run custom UserMemberAudit job because the ADInventory_ExtendedAttributesPivotView does not populate despite no errors being thrown on the ADI scan.

**Desired Outcome**
The ADInventory_ExtendedAttributesPivotView will populate with Extended Attributes collected by the ADI scan and verified in the ADInventory_ExtendedAttributes table.

**Steps to Reproduce**
In the customer's environment- 
1. Try to view the ADInventory_ExtendedAttributesPivotView in SSMS (does not populate any data in NEA console)
2. Get error: FOR XML could not serialize the data for node 'NoName' because it contains a character (0x0000) which is not allowed in XML. To retrieve this data using FOR XML, convert it to binary, varbinary or image data type and use the BINARY BASE64 directive.

**Troubleshooting Completed/Notes**
- Deleted the ADInventory_ExtendedAttributesPivotView and used the AD Inventory job to recreate it
- Verified the 1-AD_Scan job is configured to collect the extended attribute
- Verified the customer is running full ADI scans (no differential)
- Verified the SA_ADInventory_ExtendedAttributes table populates
- Went through the ExtendedAttributes table looking for invalid characters
--- This is a big table with a lot of extended attributes so it will take time
