He’s running into an issue with NEA showing active users as deleted and needs to troubleshoot why it’s happening before they can run cleanup jobs with the Action Modules. He’s trying to avoid any of these uses being deleted in Active Directory causing access issues for these end users. The account is at risk of churn.","005Qk0000018eMHIAY","2024-09-12T16:37:21.000Z","2024-09-12T16:37:21.000Z","false","false"

"00aQk0000095U8LIAU","500Qk00000FfvktIAB","AD Activity is in play, will need to look at those settings.

Not sure why this was not noted when we asked if there was any automation which could be making these changes.

Brandon and I think they might need to always use Full scans to make sure that the ADI Tables are maintained correctly.

Michael replied that he was still experiencing an issue but did not advise as to his availability. Would you kindly send him a link to your availability so that he can schedule another session when it is convenient for you both?

"00aQk000009CARRIA4","500Qk00000FfvktIAB","@John Hilsher We believe that the customer has something in their environment  that is modifying users and we cannot see these changes because the customer is not licensed for AD activity.
 
If you can issue an RTU for Activity Monitor – Active Directory Activity support can deploy activity monitor to quickly identify who, what and when deletions are happening.

John will work to get the key generated for an RTU for Activity Monitor - Active Directory Activity for today's (19Sept) customer meeting.","005Qk0000018eMHIAY","2024-09-19T14:37:08.000Z","2024-09-19T14:37:08.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000009CvlJIAS","500Qk00000FfvktIAB","In the meeting, we discussed different possible solutions.
Solution #1: Always run a full ADI scan
Solution #2: Upgrade to the latest CU, which is 11.5.0.277
Solution #3: Upgrade to the latest 11.6 version
 
With Solution #2, the customer can back up the ADInventory_UsersView table,  drop the data, and run a full ADI scan.
Backup the data, drop the data, and upgrade to the latest CU of 11.5
 
If dropping the data and the CU upgrade do not fix the issue, we can discuss escalating it to R&D.
 
The customer is not willing to do any upgrade at this time. Since the full ADI scan fixes the issue temporarily, the customer decided to close this ticket and continue to run the full ADI scan as a workaround. 
He will open a new ticket when he's ready to upgrade.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-09-19T22:25:48.000Z","2024-09-19T22:25:48.000Z","false","false"
