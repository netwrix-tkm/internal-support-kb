Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support. Can you please share a screenshot of the messages table for the AD Scan job?
 

Based on what you sent over, I'm just seeing warnings related to various custom AD attributes that NEA looks for out-of-the-box, but if these aren't attributes you use, they shouldn't stop the scan from running. More information can be found here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000000divKAA.html

With the screenshot, I'll be able to get a better look though.

Thank you,

Tay,

Thanks for your patience as I was OOO for the last couple of days.

That support article did it. The scan now completes and generates data.

One final quick question, I’m not seeing that data populate to the Host Management tab now, any idea why that might be happening?

Hey Zeke,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support. Can you please share a screenshot of the messages table for the AD Scan job?
 

Based on what you sent over, I'm just seeing warnings related to various custom AD attributes that NEA looks for out-of-the-box, but if these aren't attributes you use, they shouldn't stop the scan from running. More information can be found here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000000divKAA.html

With the screenshot, I'll be able to get a better look though.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Senior Technical Support Engineer
