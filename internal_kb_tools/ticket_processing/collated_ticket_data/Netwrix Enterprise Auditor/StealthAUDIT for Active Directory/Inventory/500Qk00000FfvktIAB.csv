ADI Differential scans are not staying in sync with AD

[Resolution]
Solution #1: Always run a full ADI scan
Solution #2: Upgrade to the latest CU, which is 11.5.0.277
Solution #3: Upgrade to the latest 11.6 version

With Solution #2, the customer can back up the ADInventory_UsersView table, drop the data, and run a full ADI scan.
Backup the data, drop the data, and upgrade to the latest CU of 11.5

If dropping the data and the CU upgrade do not fix the issue, we can discuss escalating it to R&D.

The customer is not willing to do any upgrade at this time. Since the full ADI scan fixes the issue temporarily.","Product defect","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Active Directory","Inventory","11.5","11.5.0.214","13.2","Closed - Resolved","MUFG Bank, LTD.","Michael Kong","2024-09-12T14:10:20.000Z","2024-09-25T20:02:11.000Z"
