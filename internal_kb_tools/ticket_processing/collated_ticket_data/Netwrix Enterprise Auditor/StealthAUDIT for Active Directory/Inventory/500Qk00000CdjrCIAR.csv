Zeke","","","","[Issue]
“The custom attribute msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo was requested, but not set in domain 3 for the Computer object class. A full ADI scan may be required.”

[Root Cause]
The AD inventory scan job searches for common AD schema attributes by default. The job prompts corresponding warnings if your environment does not implement these attributes.

[Resolution]
Customer removed the unused custom attributes from the query settings and was able to get a successful scan after that","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Active Directory","Inventory","11.5","","7.0","Closed - Resolved","Minnwest Bank Group","Zeke Town","2024-07-03T18:28:21.000Z","2024-07-10T18:15:49.000Z"
