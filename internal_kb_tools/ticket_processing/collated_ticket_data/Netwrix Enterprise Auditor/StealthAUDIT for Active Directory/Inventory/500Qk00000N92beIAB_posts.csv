My understanding was if the ""Collect only updates since the last scan"" checkbox was cleared in the query options, this was a full scan (see other screenshot). i've unchecked that box, but still see errors and warnings.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-20T15:06:30.000Z"

-changed placeholder [tablename] with the actual table name
-re-ran analysis tasks to make sure it completed without error

discussed warnings calling out custom attributes
client has serveral domains and those attributes are not all present in all domains.
Warnings call out domains by DomainID not name
used table, ADInventory_UserView, to identify which domain was which by DomianID

 
client understands the issue and is okay with leaving as is
-he wants to make sure he's getting those attributes from the other domains that have them set

LDAP server is unavailable for one domain is because that domain has heavily limited connections
the DC it was trying to connect to has LDAP ports blocked.

Client has a custom job already in place that builds dynamic host lists for AD scans. Corrected it so it will choose a DC from that domain that isn't as limited

---------------
dropping ADInventory tables for the affected domain and re-running AD scan seems to have fixed the issue","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2025-03-31T19:46:10.000Z"
