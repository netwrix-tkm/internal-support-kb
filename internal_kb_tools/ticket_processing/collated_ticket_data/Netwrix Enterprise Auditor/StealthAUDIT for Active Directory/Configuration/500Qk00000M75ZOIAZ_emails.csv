Subject: {EXTERNAL}RE: 00436473 - Table for Sites query changes when configure to use SSL on AD_DomainInfo job

Hello Kevin,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00436473. We haven't heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you're still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We're here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00436473
Ticket Subject: Table for Sites query changes when configure to use SSL on AD_DomainInfo job
Ticket Details: I've attached screenshots of the phenomenon before and after checking the 'Use LDAP over SSL' option when configuring the AD_DomainInfo job.
The Sites query by default is set to store the queried results in the Sites table. The Trusts query by default is set to store the queried results in the Trusts table. However, when checking the 'Use LDAP over SSL' option, it changes the table to store the Sites query into the Trusts table as well. When unchecking the use SSL option, the table stays stuck on storing the Sites results into Trusts. I saw this occurring in 11.6.0.47 and also in 11.6.0.59 in my lab. This definitely seems to be some kind of bug which is preventing from using the SSL as an option.

Thank you!
