The Sites query by default is set to store the queried results in the Sites table. The Trusts query by default is set to store the queried results in the Trusts table. However, when checking the 'Use LDAP over SSL' option, it changes the table to store the Sites query into the Trusts table as well. When unchecking the use SSL option, the table stays stuck on storing the Sites results into Trusts. I saw this occurring in 11.6.0.47 and also in 11.6.0.59 in my lab. This definitely seems to be some kind of bug which is preventing from using the SSL as an option.","","","","0050g000006QqyEAAS","2025-02-20T16:40:45.000Z"
