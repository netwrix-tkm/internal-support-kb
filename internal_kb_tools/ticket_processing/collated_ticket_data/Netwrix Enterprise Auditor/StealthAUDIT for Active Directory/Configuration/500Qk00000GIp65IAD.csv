"500Qk00000GIp65IAD","00422235","Support Ticket","Clarification on Stealth Audit LDAP Usage and AD Service Dependencies","Hello,

We are currently working on ensuring that our AccessMC Windows servers used for the Stealth Audit Application route LDAP calls through the F5 VIP. However, we need clarification on whether Stealth Audit is only using LDAP port 636 or if it is also utilizing additional Active Directory (AD) services, beyond LDAP, when collecting from AD.

Could you please confirm the following:

Is Stealth Audit exclusively using LDAP over port 636?
Are there any other AD web services or ports in use during the data collection process that might require a direct connection to domain controllers, rather than routing through the F5 VIP?
Additionally, we would appreciate any documentation or guidance on the LDAP configuration for Stealth Audit servers to ensure everything is set up correctly.","","","","KB Shared: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ActiveDirectory/Overview.htm","Guidance","Saqib Sharif","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Active Directory","Configuration","11.6","","7.3","Closed - Resolved","Mastercard","Kunal Gajbhiye","2024-09-26T16:45:01.000Z","2024-10-04T00:04:03.000Z"
