We looked at the Full report for Weak Passwords:

This job identifies accounts in the organization with weak passwords that can be easily decrypted or brute forced.

The job analyzes user account password hashes to determine how easily each could be compromised or the likelihood their passwords are known through comparison with compromised password dictionaries and other exceptions.
The job leverages a dictionary file, which is updated at runtime. Please see our documentation to download this file manually if necessary.
*  AES Key Missing - accounts set up using older functional AD levels and as such have no AES keys, these will use weaker encryption methods susceptible to brute force attacks
*  Clear Text Password - the listed accounts have passwords stored with reversible encryption..Read More
*  Default Computer Password - the listed computers have default computer passwords set
*  Delegable Admins - these administrator accounts are allowed to be delegated to a service
*  DES Encryption Only - the listed accounts are using Kerberos DES encryption, DES encryption is considered weak as the 56-bit key is prone to brute force attacks..Read More
*  Empty Password - the listed accounts have an empty password
*  Kerberos Pre-authentication is not required - the listed accounts do not require Kerberos Pre-authentication. Kerberos Pre-authentication can mitigate against brute force attacks..Read More
*  LM Hash - the listed accounts have stored LM hashes, the LM hash is a relatively weak hash that is prone to brute force attacks..Read More
*  Password Never Expires - the listed accounts have a password that never expires
*  Password Not Required - the listed accounts do not require a password
*  Potential Keytab Password - the listed account has a potential plaintext password stored in the userPassword attribute in Active Directory..Read More
*  Shares Common Password - the listed accounts share a password with another account
*  Weak Historical Password - the listed accounts have a historical password that was found in the dictionary
*  Weak Password - the listed accounts have a password that was found in the dictionary*  AES Key Missing - accounts set up using older functional AD levels and as such have no AES keys, these will use weaker encryption methods susceptible to brute force attacks

*  Weak Password - the listed accounts have a password that was found in the dictionary

The Weak Password job depends on a dictionary file:
Netwrix maintains a dictionary file which is automatically updated (if necessary) in the job before each run.
You may alternatively upload a file in the configuration settings on the job, the following formats may be used:
*  Plaintext Dictionary - line separated in a text file
*  NTLM Hash Dictionary - either hashes or sorted hashes. The haveibeenpwned dictionary may be downloaded from their website and used in the job directly. For performance, you should download the NTLM (ordered by hash) dictionary.
*  Netwrix Dictionary - the dictionary may be downloaded from our website here and used in the job directly
The above list is found in the jobs folder:
file:///E:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/STEALTHbits/StealthAUDIT/Jobs/GROUP_Active%20Directory/GROUP_2.Users/JOB_AD_WeakPasswords/Description.htm

ExposureCount represents the number of times a particular password was exposed in a breach according to the HIBP dictionary.

The Weak Password job depends on a dictionary file:
Netwrix maintains a dictionary file which is automatically updated (if necessary) in the job before each run.
You may alternatively upload a file in the configuration settings on the job, the following formats may be used:
*  Plaintext Dictionary - line separated in a text file
*  NTLM Hash Dictionary - either hashes or sorted hashes. The haveibeenpwned dictionary may be downloaded from their website and used in the job directly. For performance, you should download the NTLM (ordered by hash) dictionary.
*  Netwrix Dictionary - the dictionary may be downloaded from our website here and used in the job directly
The above list is found in the jobs folder:
file:///E:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/STEALTHbits/StealthAUDIT/Jobs/GROUP_Active%20Directory/GROUP_2.Users/JOB_AD_WeakPasswords/Description.htm

ExposureCount represents the number of times a particular password was exposed in a breach according to the HIBP dictionary.

Per our call today we circled back on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) 11.6.0.122 Jobs  >> Active Directory >> 2.Users >> AD_WeakPasswords report.

It was noted that once the ANALYZE HISTORICAL PASSWORDS was disabled the report makes more since as to what the last scan is displaying.

I will close out this ticket as noted.

We have 30days to reopen once the closure email is received.

To reopen we can just reply to that email to bring the case back into my queue.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. 

Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link.

Have a great week.

Again, thank You for your time.
