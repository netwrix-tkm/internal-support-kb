Thank you for reaching out to support.

If in in a customers domain please identify the customer so I can correctly update the ticket .

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:

Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object |  Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

Could we also get an export of the job in question?
Example if needed:
