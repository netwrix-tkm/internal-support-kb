Ilya, It comes under the Shell Reports - Custom job. This was created long back mostly in 2021 or so. There were no changes to the environment or the logic.

The report gives Shell AD Trusts information.

When can we connect to look at this issue?

Ilya, It comes under the Shell Reports – Custom job. This was created long back mostly in 2021 or so. There were no changes to the environment or the logic.

 

The report gives Shell AD Trusts information.

 

When can we connect to look at this issue?
