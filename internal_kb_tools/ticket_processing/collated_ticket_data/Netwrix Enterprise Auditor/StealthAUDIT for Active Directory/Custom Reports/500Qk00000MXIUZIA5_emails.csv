Graham,

Thank you for your time today. I've taken your feedback on how it currently functions and how would you like it to work (essentially the same way just on a scale of the 700+ resources you have). This would probably involve a custom report or a query, my colleague, Nicholas, will be able to assist you with that.

Best wishes,

Hello Graham,

I would say this is our most likely OOTB solution.



The FS_ShareAUDIT is to target shares and it will output Users with permissions. 
The FS_TrusteePermissions is where you pick Users/Groups and then it outputs effective access.

With Either you could customize report output to filter out what you don't want.
Or you could look at the analysis and create your own custom based on it.

Definitely something we could look into.

Thanks,

Graham,

May I inquiry about 'in bulk' part? If we do not have the function built-in - I'll create a Feature Request so this can be potentially implemented in future versions of AIC/NEA.


What is the feature being requested?
The ability to produce specific reports in bulk (please elaborate): 

Are there any specifics on how you would like this feature to work/look/operate?


Provide a use case for this feature: 
Example: 'I want to be able to produce reports on a certain job for all domains/collections by pressing a single button'

It does output a ton of data though, but if you are working in SQL after it gets the data, its pretty manageable.

I'll shoot an invite so we can review together.

Checking in Graham,

Sorry we weren't able to meet prior to me being OOO.

Have you met with or discussed with anyone else in the mean time?

I think this Trustee report will be sufficient, as long as I can get it to cooperate with groups. Hopefully I'll get more information on that tomorrow and update you after.

Thanks,
