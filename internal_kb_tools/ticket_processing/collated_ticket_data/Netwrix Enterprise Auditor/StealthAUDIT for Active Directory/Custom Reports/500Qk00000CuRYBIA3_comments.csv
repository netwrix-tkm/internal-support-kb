"00aQk000008g4VdIAI","500Qk00000CuRYBIA3","Through testing in the customer's environment yesterday, we were able to get a successful run of the report by changing the job name to ""Create NewEmployees"" from ""Create New Employees"". This job/report worked when it was implemented by ProServ, but we're not sure what changed to cause the name to be too long all of a sudden.

The customer did recently upgrade to v11.6.

We are also seeing the following error of a step/job further down in the group (Ticket #00416837):
