There is a custom job that was pointed at StealthIntercept DB to get reports on Admin Group Membership changes. It was pointed that old domain was decommissioned and that the report should give output for new Admin Groups. In the SI console, we opened the Admin Group Membership changes job. It was discussed that you need to configure the Admin Group here and that subsequent reports running in StealthAUDIT will export the required result.","","","","005Qk00000214EvIAI","2024-12-03T01:29:35.000Z"

I will send follow up email to the customer today.","","","","005Qk00000214EvIAI","2024-12-03T01:29:35.000Z"
