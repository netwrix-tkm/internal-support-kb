We have couple of questions about the SA weak password report queries and need your support to customize the report based on our requirement. Request you to please schedule a call to discuss and customize the report.","","","","I had contact from Professional services team who you engaged with to discuss customer reports, and you informed that these are no longer required and ticket will be closed.

As per this request for Customization in AD Weak password reports

We provided additional columns from same tables to the report. When further additional complex customisation was requested we raised a Professional service request which you declined.

I will close the support ticket which will contain history of the request.","Missing functionality / Feature request","Alexander Buchta","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Active Directory","Custom Reports","11.5","","89.7","Closed - Resolved","Hess Corporation","Sukanya Jaivelu","2024-06-12T16:57:45.000Z","2024-09-10T08:53:18.000Z"
