As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Best wishes,

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

For the reports question:

Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.

Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)

We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.

Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.

To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Best wishes,

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response.

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:

  1.  As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
  2.  Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
  3.  Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
  4.  While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
  5.  Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?
We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

Regards,
Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question:



Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment



Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.



Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)



We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.



Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases



Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.

To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.netwrix.com/my_products.html__;!!E09OEw!dZFvmVa5ewganlLL2mo6NjFBeA3CL_S2NeNvDIMHQALHSmU9svb0l83wsoCM1ZXVsPqaJnhsSPWVEe8yOspbqEUnxQ$> log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!E09OEw!clTgIPpIMdHwi0fwnf43BWSe94WIBlO06xstZtcL0Syki8imvXIoQ-hBdVrCpew_qH0FTt8Xa6zYiaSABEnXzuv1Uw$>

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWB8LzUD6A$>

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWCxGkOn8g$>

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

1) Unless you want to update something else, no.
2) Not in a negative way, may cause improvements.
3) Configuration file, as stated in the upgrade article

The WebServer.exe.config file is automatically retained in a Backup folder created under the Web folder of the installation directory. Any custom application settings contained in this file are kept as part of this upgrade process.


Do recommend to make a manual backup just in case.
4) In your case: Upgrade in place – Performs file content updates of jobs matching the Instant Solutions but does not change the Jobs tree structure
5) No and no, aside from ensuring your Web Service and AIC Service are running from and AD ACCOUNT WITH DB ACCESS, or you will not be able to access Published Reports/AIC

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:


	As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
	Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
	Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
	While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
	Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?


We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question: 



Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment



 


Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.



 


Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)



 


We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.



 


Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases



 


Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.



To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response.

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:

  1.  As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
  2.  Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
  3.  Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
  4.  While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
  5.  Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?
We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

Regards,
Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question:



Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment



Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.



Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)



We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.



Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases



Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.

To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.netwrix.com/my_products.html__;!!E09OEw!dZFvmVa5ewganlLL2mo6NjFBeA3CL_S2NeNvDIMHQALHSmU9svb0l83wsoCM1ZXVsPqaJnhsSPWVEe8yOspbqEUnxQ$> log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!E09OEw!clTgIPpIMdHwi0fwnf43BWSe94WIBlO06xstZtcL0Syki8imvXIoQ-hBdVrCpew_qH0FTt8Xa6zYiaSABEnXzuv1Uw$>

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWB8LzUD6A$>

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWCxGkOn8g$>

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:


	As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
	Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
	Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
	While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
	Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?


We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question: 




 


Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment



 


Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.



 


Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)



 


We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.



 


Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases



 


Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.



To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response.

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:

  1.  As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
  2.  Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
  3.  Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
  4.  While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
  5.  Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?
We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

Regards,
Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question:









Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment









Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.









Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)









We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.









Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases









Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.

To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.netwrix.com/my_products.html__;!!E09OEw!dZFvmVa5ewganlLL2mo6NjFBeA3CL_S2NeNvDIMHQALHSmU9svb0l83wsoCM1ZXVsPqaJnhsSPWVEe8yOspbqEUnxQ$> log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!E09OEw!clTgIPpIMdHwi0fwnf43BWSe94WIBlO06xstZtcL0Syki8imvXIoQ-hBdVrCpew_qH0FTt8Xa6zYiaSABEnXzuv1Uw$>

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWB8LzUD6A$>

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWCxGkOn8g$>

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:


	As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
	Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
	Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
	While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
	Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?


We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question: 




 



 


 



 


Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment



 



 


 



 


Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.



 



 


 



 


Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)



 



 


 



 


We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.



 



 


 



 


Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases



 



 


 



 


Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.



To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response.

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:

  1.  As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
  2.  Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
  3.  Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
  4.  While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
  5.  Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?
We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

Regards,
Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question:

























Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment

























Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.

























Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)

























We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.

























Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases

























Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.

To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.netwrix.com/my_products.html__;!!E09OEw!dZFvmVa5ewganlLL2mo6NjFBeA3CL_S2NeNvDIMHQALHSmU9svb0l83wsoCM1ZXVsPqaJnhsSPWVEe8yOspbqEUnxQ$> log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!E09OEw!clTgIPpIMdHwi0fwnf43BWSe94WIBlO06xstZtcL0Syki8imvXIoQ-hBdVrCpew_qH0FTt8Xa6zYiaSABEnXzuv1Uw$>

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWB8LzUD6A$>

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWCxGkOn8g$>

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response.

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:

  1.  As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
  2.  Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
  3.  Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
  4.  While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
  5.  Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?
We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

Regards,
Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question:

























Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment

























Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.

























Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)

























We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.

























Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases

























Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.

To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.netwrix.com/my_products.html__;!!E09OEw!dZFvmVa5ewganlLL2mo6NjFBeA3CL_S2NeNvDIMHQALHSmU9svb0l83wsoCM1ZXVsPqaJnhsSPWVEe8yOspbqEUnxQ$> log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!E09OEw!clTgIPpIMdHwi0fwnf43BWSe94WIBlO06xstZtcL0Syki8imvXIoQ-hBdVrCpew_qH0FTt8Xa6zYiaSABEnXzuv1Uw$>

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWB8LzUD6A$>

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWCxGkOn8g$>

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response.

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:

  1.  As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
  2.  Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
  3.  Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
  4.  While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
  5.  Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?
We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

Regards,
Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question:

























Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment

























Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.

























Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)

























We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.

























Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases

























Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.

To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.netwrix.com/my_products.html__;!!E09OEw!dZFvmVa5ewganlLL2mo6NjFBeA3CL_S2NeNvDIMHQALHSmU9svb0l83wsoCM1ZXVsPqaJnhsSPWVEe8yOspbqEUnxQ$> log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!E09OEw!clTgIPpIMdHwi0fwnf43BWSe94WIBlO06xstZtcL0Syki8imvXIoQ-hBdVrCpew_qH0FTt8Xa6zYiaSABEnXzuv1Uw$>

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWB8LzUD6A$>

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWCxGkOn8g$>

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Hi Ilya,

Thank you for sharing the details.

Could you please confirm, entire upgrade process will take how much time so that we can raise change request accordingly?
Also, could you please confirm your availability for Monday ? We are putting together a document with the execution plan, and we would like you to review it during our meeting on Monday.

Thanks,

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response.

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:

  1.  As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
  2.  Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
  3.  Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
  4.  While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
  5.  Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?
We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

Regards,
Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question:

























Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment

























Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.

























Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)

























We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.

























Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases

























Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.

To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.netwrix.com/my_products.html__;!!E09OEw!dZFvmVa5ewganlLL2mo6NjFBeA3CL_S2NeNvDIMHQALHSmU9svb0l83wsoCM1ZXVsPqaJnhsSPWVEe8yOspbqEUnxQ$> log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!E09OEw!clTgIPpIMdHwi0fwnf43BWSe94WIBlO06xstZtcL0Syki8imvXIoQ-hBdVrCpew_qH0FTt8Xa6zYiaSABEnXzuv1Uw$>

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWB8LzUD6A$>

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWCxGkOn8g$>

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:


	As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
	Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
	Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
	While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
	Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?


We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question:

Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases



 



 


 



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.



To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Thank you for the time on the meeting today.

We added steps to check service accounts running services and make sure Schedules are disabled prior to upgrade. 

No jobs should be running prior to upgrade.

We reviewed your steps for upgrade which you are planning to run next Wednesday after CST working hours. This falls into APAC working time, so I have assigned to my team member Ilia Kudashev.

Please coordinate with Ilia time to run through the upgrade on Wednesday/

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:


	As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
	Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
	Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
	While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
	Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?


We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question: 



 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.



To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Sukanya

Thank you for the time on the meeting today.

We added steps to check service accounts running services and make sure Schedules are disabled prior to upgrade.

No jobs should be running prior to upgrade.

We reviewed your steps for upgrade which you are planning to run next Wednesday after CST working hours. This falls into APAC working time, so I have assigned to my team member Ilia Kudashev.

Please coordinate with Ilia time to run through the upgrade on Wednesday/

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response.

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:

  1.  As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
  2.  Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
  3.  Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
  4.  While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
  5.  Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?
We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

Regards,
Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question:



















































Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment



















































Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.



















































Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)



















































We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.



















































Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases



















































Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.

To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.netwrix.com/my_products.html__;!!E09OEw!dZFvmVa5ewganlLL2mo6NjFBeA3CL_S2NeNvDIMHQALHSmU9svb0l83wsoCM1ZXVsPqaJnhsSPWVEe8yOspbqEUnxQ$> log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Please share your questions, I will gladly answer them. I suggest having a meeting if you need assistance with something.

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWB8LzUD6A$>

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWCxGkOn8g$>

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Sukanya

Thank you for the time on the meeting today.

We added steps to check service accounts running services and make sure Schedules are disabled prior to upgrade. 

No jobs should be running prior to upgrade.

We reviewed your steps for upgrade which you are planning to run next Wednesday after CST working hours. This falls into APAC working time, so I have assigned to my team member Ilia Kudashev.

Please coordinate with Ilia time to run through the upgrade on Wednesday/

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:


	As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
	Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
	Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
	While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
	Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?


We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Sukanya

Thank you for the time on the meeting today.

We added steps to check service accounts running services and make sure Schedules are disabled prior to upgrade.

No jobs should be running prior to upgrade.

We reviewed your steps for upgrade which you are planning to run next Wednesday after CST working hours. This falls into APAC working time, so I have assigned to my team member Ilia Kudashev.

Please coordinate with Ilia time to run through the upgrade on Wednesday/



Best regards,

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response.

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:

  1.  As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
  2.  Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
  3.  Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
  4.  While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
  5.  Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?
We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

Regards,
Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question:

































































































































Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment

































































































































Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.

































































































































Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)

































































































































We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.

































































































































Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases

































































































































Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!E09OEw!clTgIPpIMdHwi0fwnf43BWSe94WIBlO06xstZtcL0Syki8imvXIoQ-hBdVrCpew_qH0FTt8Xa6zYiaSABEnXzuv1Uw$>

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWB8LzUD6A$>

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWCxGkOn8g$>

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Sukanya

Thank you for the time on the meeting today.

We added steps to check service accounts running services and make sure Schedules are disabled prior to upgrade. 

No jobs should be running prior to upgrade.

We reviewed your steps for upgrade which you are planning to run next Wednesday after CST working hours. This falls into APAC working time, so I have assigned to my team member Ilia Kudashev.

Please coordinate with Ilia time to run through the upgrade on Wednesday/

2) Not in a negative way, may cause improvements.
3) Configuration file, as stated in the upgrade article 


The WebServer.exe.config file is automatically retained in a Backup folder created under the Web folder of the installation directory. Any custom application settings contained in this file are kept as part of this upgrade process.

Do recommend to make a manual backup just in case.
4) In your case: Upgrade in place – Performs file content updates of jobs matching the Instant Solutions but does not change the Jobs tree structure

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:


	As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
	Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
	Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
	While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
	Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?


We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Best wishes,

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Best wishes,

I can assign this to an engineer in the region you specified, however on previous call I advised that you planned for after CST working hours (APAC) however this now falls into EMEA working hours.

Once I have assigned this, you will be required to schedule a meeting prior to upgrade so that the engineer is familiar with your environment prior to upgrade. Following this any subsequent meeting will need to be scheduled ahead of time.

Hi Sukanya

Thank you for the time on the meeting today.

We added steps to check service accounts running services and make sure Schedules are disabled prior to upgrade. 

No jobs should be running prior to upgrade.

We reviewed your steps for upgrade which you are planning to run next Wednesday after CST working hours. This falls into APAC working time, so I have assigned to my team member Ilia Kudashev.

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:


	As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
	Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
	Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
	While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
	Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?


We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Sukanya

I can assign this to an engineer in the region you specified, however on previous call I advised that you planned for after CST working hours (APAC) however this now falls into EMEA working hours.

Once I have assigned this, you will be required to schedule a meeting prior to upgrade so that the engineer is familiar with your environment prior to upgrade. Following this any subsequent meeting will need to be scheduled ahead of time.

Best regards,

Hi Sukanya

Thank you for the time on the meeting today.

We added steps to check service accounts running services and make sure Schedules are disabled prior to upgrade.

No jobs should be running prior to upgrade.

We reviewed your steps for upgrade which you are planning to run next Wednesday after CST working hours. This falls into APAC working time, so I have assigned to my team member Ilia Kudashev.

Please coordinate with Ilia time to run through the upgrade on Wednesday/

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response.

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:

  1.  As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
  2.  Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
  3.  Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
  4.  While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
  5.  Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?
We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

Regards,
Sukanya Jaivelu

Sukanya,

That would require manually adding each one in the salesforce.

For the reports question:



































































































































































































































































Enhancement: Enhanced AD Security Assessment



































































































































































































































































Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now has 50 new AD security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities.



































































































































































































































































Enhancement: Revised Credentials and Data Security Assessment (CDSA)



































































































































































































































































We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.



































































































































































































































































Enhancement: Single Reports Across Multiple Databases



































































































































































































































































Netwrix Enterprise Auditor now generates combined reports for all monitored databases, including sensitive data, security assessments, and database sizing.

To download the product, please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.netwrix.com/my_products.html__;!!E09OEw!dZFvmVa5ewganlLL2mo6NjFBeA3CL_S2NeNvDIMHQALHSmU9svb0l83wsoCM1ZXVsPqaJnhsSPWVEe8yOspbqEUnxQ$> log in and you will have access to the downloads.

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Sukanya,

As promised, here's the articles

What's New and Bugfixes for NEA 11.6: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/WhatsNew.htm__;!!E09OEw!clTgIPpIMdHwi0fwnf43BWSe94WIBlO06xstZtcL0Syki8imvXIoQ-hBdVrCpew_qH0FTt8Xa6zYiaSABEnXzuv1Uw$>

Upgrade instructions: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWB8LzUD6A$>

I suggest updating, if possible so you can check if the reports might have the data already available, for example: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/InstantJobs/AD_PasswordExpirationNotification.htm__;!!E09OEw!dm7womGtbEfgmKyOf54RxUGPAGEzuyk8_ItWrA91PTMI9BZIvGek5-AY0MuM0R_Pbba6cE7PR1SJAfYLwWCxGkOn8g$>

This report requires password details data which is what you're basically looking for.

Hi Sukanya

I can assign this to an engineer in the region you specified, however on previous call I advised that you planned for after CST working hours (APAC) however this now falls into EMEA working hours.

Once I have assigned this, you will be required to schedule a meeting prior to upgrade so that the engineer is familiar with your environment prior to upgrade. Following this any subsequent meeting will need to be scheduled ahead of time.

Best regards,

Hi Sukanya

Thank you for the time on the meeting today.

We added steps to check service accounts running services and make sure Schedules are disabled prior to upgrade. 

No jobs should be running prior to upgrade.

We reviewed your steps for upgrade which you are planning to run next Wednesday after CST working hours. This falls into APAC working time, so I have assigned to my team member Ilia Kudashev.

Please coordinate with Ilia time to run through the upgrade on Wednesday/

1) Unless you want to update something else, no.
2) Not in a negative way, may cause improvements.
3) Configuration file, as stated in the upgrade article 


The WebServer.exe.config file is automatically retained in a Backup folder created under the Web folder of the installation directory. Any custom application settings contained in this file are kept as part of this upgrade process.

Do recommend to make a manual backup just in case.
4) In your case: Upgrade in place – Performs file content updates of jobs matching the Instant Solutions but does not change the Jobs tree structure

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:


	As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
	Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
	Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
	While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
	Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?


We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

Hi Sukanya

I can assign this to an engineer in the region you specified, however on previous call I advised that you planned for after CST working hours (APAC) however this now falls into EMEA working hours.

Once I have assigned this, you will be required to schedule a meeting prior to upgrade so that the engineer is familiar with your environment prior to upgrade. Following this any subsequent meeting will need to be scheduled ahead of time.

Hi Sukanya

Thank you for the time on the meeting today.

We added steps to check service accounts running services and make sure Schedules are disabled prior to upgrade.

No jobs should be running prior to upgrade.

We reviewed your steps for upgrade which you are planning to run next Wednesday after CST working hours. This falls into APAC working time, so I have assigned to my team member Ilia Kudashev.

Please coordinate with Ilia time to run through the upgrade on Wednesday/

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response.

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:

  1.  As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
  2.  Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
  3.  Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
  4.  While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
  5.  Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?
We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

Regards,
Sukanya Jaivelu

We've enhanced CDSA by incorporating more security indicators, offering a more comprehensive and trustworthy security evaluation.

Sukanya,

As I've mentioned, you'd need to update to 11.6 first, since it has some of the reports on what you seek.

As checked, 2 PM IST slot on July 19th is unavailable. Please note, we have scheduled the upgrade to begin at 2 PM IST and need to start the implementation during that period. Hence, please let us know if you will be able to join at 2 PM IST on July 19th?

Hi Sukanya

I can assign this to an engineer in the region you specified, however on previous call I advised that you planned for after CST working hours (APAC) however this now falls into EMEA working hours.

Once I have assigned this, you will be required to schedule a meeting prior to upgrade so that the engineer is familiar with your environment prior to upgrade. Following this any subsequent meeting will need to be scheduled ahead of time.

Best regards,

Hi Sukanya

Thank you for the time on the meeting today.

We added steps to check service accounts running services and make sure Schedules are disabled prior to upgrade. 

No jobs should be running prior to upgrade.

We reviewed your steps for upgrade which you are planning to run next Wednesday after CST working hours. This falls into APAC working time, so I have assigned to my team member Ilia Kudashev.

Please coordinate with Ilia time to run through the upgrade on Wednesday/

1) Unless you want to update something else, no.
2) Not in a negative way, may cause improvements.
3) Configuration file, as stated in the upgrade article 


The WebServer.exe.config file is automatically retained in a Backup folder created under the Web folder of the installation directory. Any custom application settings contained in this file are kept as part of this upgrade process.

Do recommend to make a manual backup just in case.
4) In your case: Upgrade in place – Performs file content updates of jobs matching the Instant Solutions but does not change the Jobs tree structure
5) No and no, aside from ensuring your Web Service and AIC Service are running from and AD ACCOUNT WITH DB ACCESS, or you will not be able to access Published Reports/AIC

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

We have below queries related to StealthAudit upgrade:


	As part of Stealth Audit upgrade, do we need to download only ""Enterprise Auditor Management Platform"" setup file? Any other file listed under the product download required for installation?
	Will the upgrade impact any existing Jobs?
	Apart from server and DB snapshot, is there any other backup required before the upgrade to ensure custom jobs/configurations are not impacted?
	While running the upgrade wizard, should we choose ""Upgrade in place""? As we would not like to change the job tree structure. Which option is preferred?
	Do we need to update the license file post upgrade? Any other post upgrade activity?


We are planning to perform the upgrade next week Wednesday, 10th July. Please let us know your convenient time to schedule the call accordingly.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu
