---------------------------------------
Saqib Sharif: I had a meeting with the customer today (20/02/2025). They wanted to create a job that would generate a report containing the following fields for user accounts in AD:

DomainName,
SamAccountName,
DisplayName,
DistinguishedName,
IsDeleted,
EmployeeId,
WhenCreated,
WhenChanged,
LastLogonTimestamp,
AccountExpires,
PwdLastSetDate,
ACCOUNTDISABLE,
OU
---------------------------------------------
Since OU is not readily available, we had to create a new SQL view. The data is now available for the customer.
