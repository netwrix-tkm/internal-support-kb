Thank you for meeting with me yesterday. To recap our session, we:

	Built a SQLviewcreation analysis under the EntraID2. UsersAAD_List of AZ Users job that will filter the SA_AzureADInventory_UsersView to DisplayNames that begin with AZ
	
		Built an exportable report that can also be emailed
	
	
	Built a SQLviewcreation analysis under the Active DirectoryALI.PRI1.GroupsAD_GroupsWithPrivMembers job that will filter the SA_ADInventory_GroupMembersView to SAMAccountNames that begin with V0, DA, and P0
	
		Built an exportable report that can also be emailed
	
	


For the last report you're looking for on ""Users not affected by any GPO"", unfortunately we don't have any way out of the box to capture and report on that data, however our Professional Services team may be able to get something built for you if necessary. Or, I can also submit a feature request to our development team on your behalf, but I can't offer any guarantee when/if it will be implemented.

Here is our session recording of yesterday (I recommend downloading locally as this recording will be purged in 60 days):
