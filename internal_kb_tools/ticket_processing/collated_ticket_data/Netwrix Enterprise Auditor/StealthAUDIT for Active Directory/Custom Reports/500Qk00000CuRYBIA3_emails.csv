Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support. Usually that path length error is due to a limitation in Microsoft, however, there is a way to disable it: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry

When do you see this error occurring?

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri
