Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
had a look at a custom job that was pointed at StealthIntercept DB to get reports on Admin Group Membership changes. It was pointed that old domain was decommisioned and that the report should give output for new Admin Groups. In the SI console, we opened the Admin Group Membership changes job. It was discussed that you need to configure the Admin Group here and that subsequent reports running in StealthAUDIT will export the required result.
Our next steps are:
You will:
check with your team internally and set the correct AD Group in the job.
I will:
follow up with you tomorrow.

Have a great day!
