Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support. 

Has the Active Directory > 6. Activity > 0.Collection > AD_ActivityCollection job run successfully recently? The most common cause of that error is when NEA is trying to generate a report, but their hasn't been a recent successful data collection.

We can also set up a remote session to review the issue, just use the link below at your convenience to schedule:

Thank you for meeting with me today. We found the root of our issue to be that you currently aren’t licensed for the Active Directory Module. However, we were able to some of the data you were looking for with the Active Directory Inventory > 2-AD_Changes > Attribute report.

I’ll proceed with closing this ticket out. Please feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,
