Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support.

There used to be a Lockout job that relied on the SMARTLog data collector, but unfortunately it was kindly slow and clunky and no longer supported. NEA now has the Lockout report bundled as part of the AD Activity job: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectory/Activity/AD_Lockouts.htm

Thanks Tay!  I haven’t set up the activity yet for the customer I am working with, so I hadn’t looked at that group yet.  That makes sense.
FYI – It looks like the Active Directory Inventory changes job also has lockouts in one of the user events SQL tables.  Unfortunately in my case, this means if the helpdesk “fixes” the lockout before ADI runs again, there’s no state change to observe between the two ADI runs.  So I will need to use activity I think, to get what I want.


I am reasonably sure that these days you can import/ship over the activity info from Threat Manger to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.  I haven’t set that up before, can you please send me directions on how to set that up?  You can make a separate case for that if it helps your metrics.

I HAVE set up importing the activity from StealthDEFEND, but you have to “grab” it from each individual machine (meaning each domain controller).  This isn’t ideal, and I don’t remember how to set that up either.   Can you please also send directions on how to do that?  If it helps to keep things organized, you can make that a separate case too.


If you create different cases for those requests, you can close this case.  Thanks in advance for the help; it’s always nice to work with you.

There's no way currently to send AD activity data to NTM/SD from NEA. The workflow for AD Activity would look more like:

	Activity Monitor collects the AD Activity data and sends it to NEA and NTM
	Enterprise Auditor then can create AD Activity Reports

NTM/NAM Integration: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/ThreatManager_2.8/page/Content/ThreatManager/Install/Integration/ActivityMonitor.htm

AD Activity Configuration NAM/NEA: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/ActivityMonitor_7.0/page/Content/Config/ActiveDirectory/Activity.htm

Thanks for the reply, Tay.  This is a complicated topic, so I might not be phrasing my question right.  Here’s that data flow diagram, and let me explain more what I am asking.

[cid:image001.png@01DACC61.27271E20]

Because you can’t install both Activity Monitor and the StealthDefend agent on the same machine, there’s a provision to have the SD agent make the same kind of logs that Activity Monitor makes, that can be imported by NEA as activity.  This is #1 in the diagram.  I know I have done this for file system activity and am 90% sure you can also do it for AD activity.  (Activity Monitor and the SD agent are based of the same code base for the data collection portion, unless something has significantly changed since I worked there.)  It would be nice to have a remind how to set up this #1 portion, especially with respect to AD activity.  [lower priority unless #2 is not possible]

However, what I REALLY would prefer to do is item #2, where all the aggregated activity data in Theat Manager is used by NEA for activity information.  I am not sure if this mechanism is a push or pull, but I am nearly certain that this was a feature of SD in the past (and presumably still is for TM).  I just have not set that part up before, but I remember there being some sort of bridge (that was not obvious how to set up) that allows for this.  It would be far less complex to get all the aggregated data from TM (#2) than individually import activity from every domain controller (#1).

If you don’t have the information on how to do that, please take my question to engineering and ask them about it.  As always, I appreciate all your help.  I know my case are usually a little complicated or touch on some obscure piece, so thanks for helping me navigate through them.
