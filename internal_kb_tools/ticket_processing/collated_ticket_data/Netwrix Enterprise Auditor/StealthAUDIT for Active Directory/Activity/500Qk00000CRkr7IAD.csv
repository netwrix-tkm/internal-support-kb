One of the most common requests I get from customers is whether there is a locked out users report, specifically ones that were recently locked out.  Since I don't see one in the ADInventory (changes) job or in instant solutions, I think there is likely nothing out of the box for that.  We do collect the LOCKOUT flag on users however, so I can imagine it being possible to do this.  Do you have any in-house examples of jobs that do this?  They do not have to be formally blessed or approved, I'm asking for something more of a skeleton that I can look at and change to meet my needs.  I understand fully there would be no official guarantee of functionality etc.","","","","[Original Issue]
Customer was looking for a report on recent user lock outs.

[Resolution] 
Pointed the customer toward the Active Directory > 6. Activity > job group, as there is a job in there specifically for this. There used to be a Lockout job that relied on the smartlog collector to scrape DC event logs for lockouts, but it's deprecated and no longer supported.

[Secondary Issue] 
Customer wanted clarity on how AD Activity auditing is integrated in the Netwrix/Stealth suite.

[Root Cause]
Inaccurate documentation: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthINTERCEPT_7.3/page/Content/Config/ActiveDirectory/ThreatPrevention.htm

[Resolution] 
Walked the customer through how NTM, NSI, NEA, and NAM deal with a pass through AD Activity data.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Active Directory","Activity","11.6","","11.8","Closed - Resolved","Optiv","robert parsons","2024-06-28T20:50:55.000Z","2024-07-10T16:11:58.000Z"
