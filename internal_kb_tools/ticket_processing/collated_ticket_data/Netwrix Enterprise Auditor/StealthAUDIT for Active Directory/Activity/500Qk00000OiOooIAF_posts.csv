Currently we do standard lockout reports that provide us the client hostname and client IP of the machine where the lockout is happening. But we would like to advise if there are ways to deep dive this further. We currently have a banner domain where accounts are lockout out frequently almost every 5 mins. There is a script in place to auto unlock the accounts as past support engineers from our support staff were unable to track the lockout sources. We are now taking ownership of this issue and trying to understand the problem","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-02T14:10:13.000Z"
