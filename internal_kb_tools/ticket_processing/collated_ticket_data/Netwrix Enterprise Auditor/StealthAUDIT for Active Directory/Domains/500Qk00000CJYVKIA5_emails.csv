Hi Ilya,

 

The host list Included all Domains. No Trust between Domain service accounts are configured properly.

 

I have uploaded jobs export to support tickets. 

 

Please let me know your availability so we can connect over Teams and I will explain the issue in detail.

 

 

Regards,

Pramod

Hello Pramod,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Does your hostlist include all domains? Are all the domains in 2-way trust or have the service account properly configured?

Are there any errors, when running the job?

Please share screenshots.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Hello Pramod,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Does your hostlist include all domains? Are all the domains in 2-way trust or have the service account properly configured?

Are there any errors, when running the job?

Please share screenshots.

Best wishes,
