@Salesforce Dev team has pulled this onto the sprint and is actively investigating.

@Salesforce RequireMutualAuthentication requires the hostnames to fully match. Maybe they should try wdcaddc01.ssnctest.ssncad.global as the host name in their job list.


RequireIntegrity uses kerberos packet cryptographic signing which may also rely on having properly aligned host names.

@Salesforce  Can you have them run a quick test with the hardening enabled.

Ask them to try and access the SYSVOL share ( on the DC) from the NEA console while using the service account's credentials.

@Salesforce I've got a good tool going that we can use to test for the GPO issue. It simulates us doing an impersonated logon and performing the GPO search, but I can modify impersonation flags. If we want to schedule a call for tomorrow I am available

@Helen Randall @Carlos Mejia @Michael Burrofato @Adam DeSapio @WaitingOnEngineer - Adam and I got on a call with this customer today and Adam was able to demonstrate using the tool he built that even windows can't get access to SYSVOL with the explicit hardening settings in place. Without the hardening settings in place things work fine. 

Per MSFT documentation (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/file-server/smb-interception-defense?tabs=group-policy) UNC hardening is on by default in the WS versions the customer is on, so they shouldn't need to have the hardening explicitly set. The customer agreed this is not a product issue, and said he would do some more analysis and testing on their side. 

The workaround he mentioned that the NA team used will not work here because that was using remote powershell to get around this whereas this job connects over SMB using Kerberos. I will touch base with the NA team though just to see if they have other insights we could explore.
