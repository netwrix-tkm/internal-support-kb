27/03/2025 08:37:10  ERROR  SQLSERVER  TSPSQLServerConfigItf.RunSQLScripts  ""File: ""OneDcPerDomain.func"", error: Invalid column name 'IsDomainController'  ""      6132  6992  1808

Under the hood it looks like this function is using a cursor based on:

SELECT DISTINCT [WindowsDomain] FROM [SA_HostMasterTbl]

 So either there is no HostMasterTbl or there is a jacked up HostMasterTbl
 Or they have an issue with their SQL service account and it can't see the HostMasterTbl

  if they can use that exact account, via SSMS, to do

 SELECT TOP(1) [Name] 
FROM [SA_HostMasterTbl] 
WHERE ([IsDomainController] = 'True')

That will see if they can actually reference the IsDomainController column that is throwing the error.","0050g000006QqyEAAS","2025-03-31T17:31:08.000Z","2025-03-31T17:31:08.000Z","false","false"

Dev Guidance is as follows: 

So far it looks like they are failing to create AD tables with an error on column 'name'. We only use the column 'name' when querying for objects in the system tables. 

 

We only use the column 'name' to check in:

	 - 	sys.indexes
	 - 	sys.columns
	 - 	sys.key_constraints
	 - 	sys.default_constraints
	 - 	sys.types


select top 1 name from sys.indexes
select top 1 name from sys.columns
select top 1 name from sys.key_constraints
select top 1 name from sys.default_constraints
select top 1 name from sys.types
After reviewing these items on call, found DB Collation may be at fault here. Customer has server level collations set to case sensitive when we require case insensitive. Documentation on that topic can be found here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/OtherLanguages.htm.


Customer's next steps: Reinstall SQL server with required collation server setting and reinstall NEA. ETA is 24-48 hours due to compliance/process on customer side. Next call scheduled for tomorrow (4/2) at 10:30AM EST.
