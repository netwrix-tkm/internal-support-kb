All jobs have been disabled until we can understand if this is expected behavior with the product or not and how to better plan for an anticipate jobs running and how they are changed due to this new module.","","","","Confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                11.5.0.257
Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC)      11.5.0.136

Looked at the Database Sizing which we seem well whit in for current usage.

Noted that the Transaction log is over 400GB with 100% of the space now listed as unused
Recover is set to Full << recommend this be set to Simple for all Netwrix/Stealthbits related DBs  

SQL Server is a failover

Ran the following to clean up the bloated Tmp tables
            truncate table [dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp3]
            truncate table [dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp2]
            truncate table [dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp]
           
            IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp3]') AND type in (N'U'))
            DROP TABLE [SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp3]
           
            IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp2]') AND type in (N'U'))
            DROP TABLE [SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp2]
           
            IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].[SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp]') AND type in (N'U'))
            DROP TABLE [SA_AD_GroupStamping_tmp]

            IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].SA_AD_GroupStamping_Log') AND type in (N'U'))
             DROP TABLE SA_AD_GroupStamping_Log

            IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].SA_AD_GroupStamping_DailyActions') AND type in (N'U'))
            DROP TABLE SA_AD_GroupStamping_DailyActions

Reached out to Bridget Comito to correct the license.

Had the DBA set the Recovery Mode on the DB to Simple as well as shrink the 94.3 unallocated Data space and 100% unused Log Space.","Insufficient hardware resources","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Active Directory","Database","11.5","257","16.9","Closed - Resolved","Osaic","James Foreman","2024-07-09T15:28:27.000Z","2024-07-26T12:51:40.000Z"
