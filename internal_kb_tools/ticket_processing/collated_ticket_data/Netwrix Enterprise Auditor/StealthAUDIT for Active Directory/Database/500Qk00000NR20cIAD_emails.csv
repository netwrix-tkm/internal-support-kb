My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help with this issue.

Do you have any logs or other artifacts for this issue? Which part of the AD Inventory is failing, the AD_Scan, AD_Changes, or AD_Exceptions? I'd like to see DEBUG logs from the AD_Scan job. 

Thank you,

The AD_Scan job is failing. Seems to be related to database permissions based on errors for ‘invalid columns’.

I had them walk through dropping the ADI tables but even that job failed with similar messages.

Here is their reply:

Kurtis,
We have followed all the steps mentioned below even the remove tables job got failed  with the errors as shown in the below screenshot.
[cid:image001.png@01DB9FC1.FF306DB0]
We can see that account has all the required permissions and it was able to create the tables/views in the database not sure why  there would be an issue for creating some tables/views that were being logged in our error. Please find the below screenshot of the account permissions in DB.

[cid:image002.png@01DB9FC1.FF306DB0]  [cid:image003.png@01DB9FC1.FF306DB0]

Below screenshot shows that it was able to create the tables/views/functions/Stored Procedures inherently. Not sure why it was unable to create few tables/views despite having all the permissions.

Since we worked out that this was caused by SQL Server Collation and the issue has now been resolved, I will proceed with closing this ticket out.
