Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the DEV Environment:

FROM:
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)    11.5.0.182
TO:
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)    11.5.0.276


For the DEV domain will need to confirm the following:
AD_DomainInfo Job Permissions
While the LDAP Data Collector and Active Directory Data Collector typically requires Domain Administrator permissions when targeting a domain controller, that level of access is not required to run the 5.Domains > AD_DomainInfo Job. The minimum requirements for running this job, which must be configured at the Domain level in Active Directory, are:

	Read access to: %DOMAINDN% and its children
	Read access to: CN=System,%DOMAINDN% and its children
	Read access to: %SITEDN% and its children
	Read access to: %PARTITIONDNS% and its children

Lori,

Per our call today we noted the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.182

We looked at the Jobs  > Active Directory > 5.Domains  Jobs Group confirmed that the needed collection jobs are now all completing w/o error however the last AD_DCSummary fails within 3sec.

Replaced with the canned job from the D:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITInstantSolutionsGROUP_Active DirectoryGROUP_5.DomainsJOB_AD_DCSummary
Folder post doing a PowerShell Compare-Object (see below) as well as checking the current analysis against my lab via notepad++ compare plugin all reports that the queries match.

$check_file = ""<PATH>""
Compare-Object -ReferenceObject  (Get-Content -Path $current_file) -DifferenceObject (Get-Content -Path $check_file) |Where-Object {$_.SideIndicator -NE ""==""} 

Assuming that the issue was corrected in one of the later patched builds being that my lab running 11.5.0.267 which is post the Version 11.5.0.266 Released March 15,
The following table contains a comprehensive list of updates and fixes introduced in this version:
Active Directory AD_DomainControllers Failing   
Active Directory Errors with Sites query on AD_DomainInfo job < < Which we noted in the current install 

For this 90mnin meeting, we will need to have a Full backup (internal procedures) & Admin access to of the Following
DEV: Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) Server and Related SQL DB

Download and unblock
Then copy over to the Server.

Please join from your Workstations to avoid any UAC issues on the Server Stealthbits is running on:

Dusty,

 

I have upgraded the production environment to 11.5.0.276.  While the upgrade was successful, the issue is still not resolved.

Lori,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the DEV Environment:

FROM:
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)    11.5.0.182
TO:
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)    11.5.0.276


For the DEV domain will need to confirm the following:
AD_DomainInfo Job Permissions
While the LDAP Data Collector and Active Directory Data Collector typically requires Domain Administrator permissions when targeting a domain controller, that level of access is not required to run the 5.Domains > AD_DomainInfo Job. The minimum requirements for running this job, which must be configured at the Domain level in Active Directory, are:

·     Read access to: %DOMAINDN% and its children

·     Read access to: CN=System,%DOMAINDN% and its children

·     Read access to: %SITEDN% and its children

·     Read access to: %PARTITIONDNS% and its children

See the  Appendix: Variable Definitions for variable definitions.

Netwrix StealthAUDlT vl 1.5 > Permissions > Active Directory Permissions > Active Directory Solution Least Privilege Model
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Permissions_Guides/AD_Permissions/Active_Directory_Solution.htm#addomaininfo_job_permissions

I will cancel the move from today's meeting as it will not grant enough time to preform all the needed actions.

Lori,

Per our call today we noted the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.182

We looked at the Jobs  > Active Directory > 5.Domains  Jobs Group confirmed that the needed collection jobs are now all completing w/o error however the last AD_DCSummary fails within 3sec.

Replaced with the canned job from the D:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITInstantSolutionsGROUP_Active DirectoryGROUP_5.DomainsJOB_AD_DCSummary
Folder post doing a PowerShell Compare-Object (see below) as well as checking the current analysis against my lab via notepad++ compare plugin all reports that the queries match.

$current_file = ""<PATH>""
$check_file = ""<PATH>""
Compare-Object -ReferenceObject  (Get-Content -Path $current_file) -DifferenceObject (Get-Content -Path $check_file) |Where-Object {$_.SideIndicator -NE ""==""} 

Assuming that the issue was corrected in one of the later patched builds being that my lab running 11.5.0.267 which is post the Version 11.5.0.266 Released March 15,
The following table contains a comprehensive list of updates and fixes introduced in this version:
Active Directory AD_DomainControllers Failing   
Active Directory Errors with Sites query on AD_DomainInfo job < < Which we noted in the current install 

For this  90mnin meeting, we will need to have a Full backup (internal procedures) & Admin access to of the Following
DEV: Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) Server and Related SQL DB

Download and  unblock
Then copy over to the Server.
StealthAUDIT (SA)    11.5.0.276+ https://netwrix.com/customerportal/download?pdi=4

Please join from your Workstations to avoid any UAC issues on the Server Stealthbits is running on:
***NOTE*** The invite may not set the meeting reminder please adjust within your calendar once the Time is agreed on.
