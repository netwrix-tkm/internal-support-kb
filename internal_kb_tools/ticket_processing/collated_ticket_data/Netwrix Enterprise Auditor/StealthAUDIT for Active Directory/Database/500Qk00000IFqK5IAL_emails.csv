Hi,

The server with SQL database was not rebooting anymore.  We had to create a new one and did a restore from the DB.

Our 3 servers are now servers 2022 and I updated all applications on the servers.
Due to security concerns, we are implementing the use of gMSA accounts.

I think that 80% is working but we have still some problems like:


In Netwrix enterprise auditor:


  1.  Agent installs problems (port is refusing).
  2.  Access information ( enterprise web auditor) not connecting to SQL.



[cid:image001.png@01DB3A83.69893C90]


  1.  In Stealth intercept: Stealth intercept console is not opening and after a while we are receiving an error.

Please answer the questions below to help us ensure the understanding of the issue. I will send you a remote session booking link to check the status of the services. Meanwhile please restart every  Netwrix Enterprise* service, by stopping all of them and starting them again.

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:

What is the impact of the issue on your business?
Who is affected by this issue?
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken?
What are you trying to do or accomplish?
Is this a new configuration, data collection or report?
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked?
When did this issue start?
What are the steps to reproduce?
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Please perform the follow steps and upload the resulting Artifacts:

Enable Debug Logging
From the NEA Console > Settings > Application

As this ticket was created for SQL issue of NEA, I'd suggest creating separate ones for each individual problem you've encountered with a brief description.

Agent installs, if related to depending on the collector need specific ports opened, refer to the permissions/ports matrix: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/PermissionMatrix.htm

SQL database, since you've changed it, should be repointed to.

Stealth issue: needs a completely separate ticket, since it's a different product.

I'll gladly assist you with any of these, closing this ticket as resolved.
