Error Number:547,State:0,Clas","","","","[Issue]
Customer had 16 domains they wanted dropped from the database

[Root Cause]
These domains have been decommissioned

[Resolution]
We created a job using the ADInventory DC to drop the domains but ran into the error in the description. This was fixed by applying hotfix #11.5.052 (https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/General__kav/ka04u000000QmjSAAS/view) and then rerunning the drop domain job. 

After dropping domains we ran a new ADI scan and confirmed only the 4 we expected to be there were on the report.","Guidance","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Active Directory","Database","","","4.0","Closed - Resolved","CRH Americas Materials","Frank Babcock","2024-08-15T15:50:11.000Z","2024-08-19T14:40:56.000Z"
