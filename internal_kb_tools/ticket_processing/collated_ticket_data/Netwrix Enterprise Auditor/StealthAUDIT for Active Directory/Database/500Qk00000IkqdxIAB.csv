ADInventory_UsersView (Created by ""1-AD_Scan"" job)
ADInventory_ExceptionsView (Created by ""3-AD_Exceptions"" job)

ADInventory_ExceptionsView table is generated based on several analysis tasks, one of which is called ""Stale Users"".
This is the source of the 60 days criteria as this analysis task`s query finds stale users based on parameter @STALE_THRESHOLD. 

By leveraging ""Stale Users"" task, the ""3-AD_Exceptions"" job puts users whom last logon was more than 60 days (by default) into the ADInventory_ExceptionsView table. 
These users are then cross checked with the ADInventory_UsersView (Created by ""1-AD_Scan"" job) table.

To summarize, in order to change criteria for the data that gets written to the ""AD_StaleUsers"" job report, perform these steps:

1. Navigate to "".Active Directory Inventory"" solution > ""3-AD_Exceptions"" job > ""Analysis"" > select ""Stale Users"" analysis. 

2. Select ""Analysis Configuration"" 

3. Scroll the variables list until you find @STALE_THRESHOLD

4. Change the value from 60 to 30 - this will make ""3-AD_Exceptions"" job treat users who haven`t logged on for more than or equal to 30 days as stale users (instead of default 60 days). 

5. Let the "".Active Directory Inventory"" and ""Active Directory"" solutions run and complete.
Afterward, inspect the ""AD_StaleUsers"" job report and let me know the results.","Support provided customer with instructions to modify the Stale users` threshold.

As such, the number of days since last login to be considered stale (by default 60 days) can be customized within the .Active Directory Inventory > 3-AD_Exceptions job's Stale Users analysis task.
