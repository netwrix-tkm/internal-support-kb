This will list all the Jobs that a Host is referenced during a Scan.

Once in place we can just run this job.

Within SSMS we can Query to filter for our host in question.
EXAMPL:
SELECT * FROM SA_SAS_ExecutionStatistics_HostQueryDetails
WHERE [HOST] LIKE '%HOST-NETBIOS-NAME%'   --  This should resole in both the NETBIOS and FQDN to be returned

Found that in the StealthAUDIT (SA) DB had duplicate objects in the Tables from older SA_Host collections. 

Deleted From the following.  
HostMaster_SANodeFilter
HostListsTbl
SA_AD_DomainControllers_AllDCs
SA_AD_DomainControllers_Bridgehead
SA_AD_DomainControllers_GC
SA_AD_DomainControllers_PreferredBridgehead
SA_AD_DomainControllers_Significant
SA_AD_DomainInfo_Domains
SA_AD_DomainInfo_DomainSummary
SA_AD_DomainInfo_Filtering
SA_AD_DomainInfo_Sites
SA_AD_DomainInfo_TrustDetails
SA_AD_DomainInfo_Trusts

WHERE SA_HOST LIKE 'NVM305%'

Re-ran the jobs in question and all seemed to be correct.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix server","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Active Directory","Database","11.5","276","63.1","Closed - Resolved","Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.","Lori Crane","2024-06-26T19:18:54.000Z","2024-08-28T21:05:59.000Z"
