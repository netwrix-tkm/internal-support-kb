"500Qk00000Ex0ggIAB","00419141","Support Ticket","Medium vulnerabilities in Netwrix products","We have two vulnerabilities that we need help remediating

The first one is about incorrct permissions on 
c:program files (x86)stealthbitsstealthauditfilesystemam<a href='https://stealthauditrpcfsam.exe' target='_blank'>stealthauditrpcfsam.exe</a>

The audit shows that this path has Users with modify permissions.  Users (beyond Admins) should not be able to modify files in the Program files path.

I'm not sure how this got set (maybe as part of troubleshooting?) but Is it OK if we remove these permissions?

-------------

The other vulnerability is a older one for Threat manager where we need to update the .net core and <a href='https://asp.net' target='_blank'>asp.net</a> to the latest supported version (8 I believe) but when we tried to upgrade, Enterprise Auditor stopped working.  

Here are the details from the ticket
  The .Net core 6.0.19 version in <a href='https://phprdappstb01w.nbme.org' target='_blank'>phprdappstb01w.nbme.org</a> server was updated but the Stealth Bit site was inoperable. As a result, we performed a rollback of the changes on the respective server. The vendor confirms the issue and reports that they will provide a fix in the next release of Stealth Defend slated for Q3 on PhPrdAppStb01w

Does Threat Manager (and Enterprise Auditor since they both run on the same machine at present) now support the latest version of .net core and <a href='https://asp.net' target='_blank'>asp.net</a>?
If not, will the next version(s) support it?
If the next version(s) support the latest version of .net core <a href='https:///asp.net' target='_blank'>/asp.net</a>, when will they be released (approx)?","","","","[Issue]
