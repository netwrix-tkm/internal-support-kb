@Salesforce @Ethan Israel @Chris Brooks @Helen Randall @Adam DeSapio  We already have a hotfix available for more granular output for FS Action Modules results:
https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/General__kav/ka0Qk0000002sifIAA/view


I believe that hotfix was only posted for 11.5, and looks like the customer is on 11.6. So we can get an 11.6 version of that posted if needed.

Can we get provided the version of NEA they are running so we can check whether they have this fix or not?

@Salesforce this one remains on the backlog. Currently P3s are unlikely to be looked at until 2025.
