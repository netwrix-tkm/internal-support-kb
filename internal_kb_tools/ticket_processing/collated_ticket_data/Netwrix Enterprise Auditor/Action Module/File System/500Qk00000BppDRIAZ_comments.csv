@Salesforce This is currently in code review, to make sure we build compatible binaries with the customer's platform can we have the binaries from the bin folder? If not the whole bin folder the SATagParser.cli.exe and SATagParser.cli.dll files would work.

This fix is currently in testing. The information about the binaries would still be helpful for us packaging the fix once testing is complete though.

@Salesforce This is tested but we are withholding the hotfix until we get the information we need here:

We want to make sure we build compatible binaries with the customer's platform can we have the binaries from the bin folder? If not the whole bin folder the SATagParser.cli.exe and SATagParser.cli.dll files would work. Bottom line we need to know if they're using x64 or x86 version of the SATagParser.cli.exe.
