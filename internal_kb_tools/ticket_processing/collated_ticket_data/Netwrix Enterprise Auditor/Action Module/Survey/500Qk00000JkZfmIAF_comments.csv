@Salesforce @Helen Randall - just a heads up, we haven't had a chance for dev to triage this one yet but this is marked for discussion/triage on our refinement call tomorrow, will provide updates and ETA after that call.

@Salesforce  @Helen Randall  - this has been refined with dev. We will need to upgrade apache struts to the latest version to address this but will first need to investigate whether there are any compatibility issues or other updates that would be needed with that upgrade. I expect to be able to pull the investigation onto the dev sprint starting 1/22.

@Salesforce @Helen Randall - just to relay from out of band discussion in teams, the struts2-core-6.3.0.2.jar is only used in Survey Action Module, if the customer is not using Survey Action Module then they can safely remove/delete that file.
