Hello Chris,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00430098. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

Ticket Number: 00430098
Ticket Subject: Vulnerability Identified in Apache Struts CVE-2024-53677
Ticket Details: Internal vulnerability team has identified a recently discovered vulnerability in Apache Struts is affecting our Stealthbits/Enterprise Auditor installation.

System is running fine. I’m actually not sure when it might be rescanned, but I’m not worried about it and you can close the ticket as resolved. I tried to find our old internal ticket but am coming up empty.
