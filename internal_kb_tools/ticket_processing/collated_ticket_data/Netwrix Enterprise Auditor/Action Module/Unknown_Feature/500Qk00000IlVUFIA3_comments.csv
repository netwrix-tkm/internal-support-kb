@Salesforce I'm able to replicate this issue internally. It seems to be something with the input/output paths being directories. You can try to work around this by having the paths include the file name as well. This appears to be working.

We will queue up the investigating the issue with using the directory on our backlog.

@Salesforce I've messaged this to Ian directly. The limitation we appear to be running into is targeting the column that has a repeating name like the folder ""sopantest"" and ""department1"". Instead, the list fed into the action module needs to be something like ""UNCPathName"" so it has a unique line in the selected column. That way the target host target items in the wizard should have ""\[Host][PathAndName]"" and the destination should have a coded path like ""\[HostName]C:[FolderPath][Name]"" (See ""Target.png"" and ""Destination.png in SPO)
This will circumvent the errors received as it does so because the target and destination already exist after the first line item and repeat the same action which cannot be done.
