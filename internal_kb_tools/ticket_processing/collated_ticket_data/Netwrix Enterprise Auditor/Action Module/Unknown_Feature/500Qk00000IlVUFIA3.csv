"500Qk00000IlVUFIA3","00428042","Support Ticket","POC - FS AM | Eisai - Error: Cannot create a file when that file already exists - 11.6.0.72","File System Copy Action - When copying files from source to destination files are created in a fsam.tmp folder at the same level as the target. Every 1-2 mins the files are written, then deleted from the .tmp with no files winding up in the destination. No files exist prior to action. 
This happens with overwrite, terminate, retry and batching options on and off.","","USA TZ","","Input [source] and destination needs to be full UNCpaths

This will work for all files that exist in the source but will not copy the folder structure.

Building on this logic the source table must also include the folder structure or the structure must be reconstructed.","Guidance","Nicholas Zimmer","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","Action Module","","11.6","","11.1","Closed - Resolved","Eisai, Inc.","Ian Andersen","2024-11-25T15:45:10.000Z","2024-12-06T17:45:52.000Z"
