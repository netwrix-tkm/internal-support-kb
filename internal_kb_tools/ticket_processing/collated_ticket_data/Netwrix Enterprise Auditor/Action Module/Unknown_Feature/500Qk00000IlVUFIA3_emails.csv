I see we are having some problems with the copy process. 
Lets see if we can get to the bottom of it. I am reviewing the artifacts and making sure Development has access to them with the escalation.


So it seems as though it copies the files to a temp folder, which you can see, then deletes them and doesn't move them to the destination folder. 
I want to make sure I understand that is the process.


Thanks,
