1) Is your screenshot from AIC, a report, SDD or FSAA?  

2) Are you actually scanning that directory with both FSAA and SDD?

3) If you navigate to the path below or to the equivalent in your SA/NEA configuration:

FileSystem > 0.Collection > 1-SEEK System Scans > Configure > Queries > FSAA DC > Sensitive Data Settings > ""Perform differential scan""

Do you have the box checked for ""Perform differential scan""?

4) Please navigate to NEA > Help > About to obtain your current NEA version.
According to our records, you are at least running NEA 11.6.0.130.
Is that correct? 

5) Also please use ""appwiz.cpl"" (or Programs and Features) to confirm that you are running NEA Sensitive Data (SDD) version 11.6.0.17 or later.

Hi John,

1) Is your screenshot from AIC, a report, SDD or FSAA?

2) Are you actually scanning that directory with both FSAA and SDD?

3) If you navigate to the path below or to the equivalent in your SA/NEA configuration:

FileSystem > 0.Collection > 1-SEEK System Scans > Configure > Queries > FSAA DC > Sensitive Data Settings > ""Perform differential scan""

Do you have the box checked for ""Perform differential scan""?

4) Please navigate to NEA > Help > About to obtain your current NEA version.
According to our records, you are at least running NEA 11.6.0.130.
Is that correct?

5) Also please use ""appwiz.cpl"" (or Programs and Features) to confirm that you are running NEA Sensitive Data (SDD) version 11.6.0.17 or later.

Hi John,

1) Is your screenshot from AIC, a report, SDD or FSAA?

2) Are you actually scanning that directory with both FSAA and SDD?

3) If you navigate to the path below or to the equivalent in your SA/NEA configuration:

FileSystem > 0.Collection > 1-SEEK System Scans > Configure > Queries > FSAA DC > Sensitive Data Settings > ""Perform differential scan""

Do you have the box checked for ""Perform differential scan""?

4) Please navigate to NEA > Help > About to obtain your current NEA version.
According to our records, you are at least running NEA 11.6.0.130.
Is that correct?

5) Also please use ""appwiz.cpl"" (or Programs and Features) to confirm that you are running NEA Sensitive Data (SDD) version 11.6.0.17 or later.

Hi John,

1) Is your screenshot from AIC, a report, SDD or FSAA?

2) Are you actually scanning that directory with both FSAA and SDD?

3) If you navigate to the path below or to the equivalent in your SA/NEA configuration:

FileSystem > 0.Collection > 1-SEEK System Scans > Configure > Queries > FSAA DC > Sensitive Data Settings > ""Perform differential scan""

Do you have the box checked for ""Perform differential scan""?

4) Please navigate to NEA > Help > About to obtain your current NEA version.
According to our records, you are at least running NEA 11.6.0.130.
Is that correct?

5) Also please use ""appwiz.cpl"" (or Programs and Features) to confirm that you are running NEA Sensitive Data (SDD) version 11.6.0.17 or later.

Hi John,

1) Is your screenshot from AIC, a report, SDD or FSAA?

2) Are you actually scanning that directory with both FSAA and SDD?

3) If you navigate to the path below or to the equivalent in your SA/NEA configuration:

FileSystem > 0.Collection > 1-SEEK System Scans > Configure > Queries > FSAA DC > Sensitive Data Settings > ""Perform differential scan""

Do you have the box checked for ""Perform differential scan""?

4) Please navigate to NEA > Help > About to obtain your current NEA version.
According to our records, you are at least running NEA 11.6.0.130.
Is that correct?

5) Also please use ""appwiz.cpl"" (or Programs and Features) to confirm that you are running NEA Sensitive Data (SDD) version 11.6.0.17 or later.

The change we made worked. I no longer see those FP. Could you get clarification on what is accepted for SDD exclusions. Is it local file path, UNC path, or wildcards? Thanks!

Just wanted to follow up.

The file path C:xxxxxxxxx.txt does not work but UNC directly to file (\servernamexxxxxxxxtext.txt) does work for SDD exclusions?

Hi John,

Tay confirmed this in her lab:

UNC directly to the file ie:
\HostShareFolderFile.txt

She is submitting feedback to the documents team to add this info to the Netwrix Help Center documentation.

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved.
The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!
+++++
For sensitive data false positive exclusion filters:
+++++
​​​​​​​
UNC directly to the file ie:
\HostShareFolderFile.txt

Using the FILE PATH like 
""C:xxxxxxxxx.txt""
does NOT work.

+++++
2025_0328: MTG with John and Tay
+++++

1) We added the following line to the end of the ""Get Shares with SDD"" analysis task on table SA_WS_OpenShares_SDD_Details:

AND mv.IsExcluded = 0

This will allow the WSH_FS_OpenAccessPasswords report to only display entries from the SA_FSDLP_MatchesView that are NOT excluded as SDD False Positives.

2) ""SA_WS_OpenShares_SDD_Details"" is a custom view where they are joining the Open Access table with the SDD Matches table to only show Open Shares with SDD

3) The reason we didn't need to rescan is because SDD False Positives do not mean we aren't scanning them, it just means they are excluded from reports, and it flips that ""IsExcluded"" value on the FSDLP_MatchesView.  Our out-of-the-box reports take that column into account.  Whoever created this report appears to have overlooked this column?  Few customers use false positives, so it is not surprising that it was overlooked.

Thank you,
Mike Candon
