Customer is unable to perform upgrade right now as they need to complete audit which will occur in 3 days. 
After this they will be ready for upgrade and I will schedule call with them to assist with that. 

Placing ticket into postponed reply until Tuesday, 15th of April. Will send follow up to customer on that date to check status.

Had a meeting with customer. Assisted with upgrade to 11.6.0.141 NAA. 

First an upgrade of Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) core installation was performed.
Afterwards the Netwrix Access Information Center was upgraded. After upgrading AIC I had to update the config file and set it back to ""https"" on port ""443"".
After modifying config file we verified AIC web page and confirmed that it is working as expected.
Lastly, we upgraded Sensitive Data Discovery add-on.

Now all installed modules are on the latest 11.6 builds:

Netwrix Access Analyzer - 11.6.0.141 
Netwrix Access Information Center - 11.6.0.37
Sensitive Data Discovery add-on - 11.6.0.18

I asked customer to run PostgreSQL DB scanning jobs after upgrade and reply with results.

Customer reported that a similar issue is now affecting their MS SQL db connections as well. 
Issue:
When customer checks MS SQL server connection in SDD scan > Filter settings, then different errors are seen there. Error appears when they test connection and not when they expand DBs inside SQL instance. 

These errors are: Login is from an untrusted domain and cannot be used with integrated authentication
and different time out errors. 

However, I tested Windows Integrated Authentication to a couple of MS SQL servers to which connection was failing in Filter settings with "" Login is from an untrusted domain""  using UDL file - and results were successful. 

It is not clear if this issue is the same issue customer was having with PostgreSQL db or not. If I confirm that the issue has different root cause - I will open a separate ticket. 

Problem is that customer has no understanding why they need all these different PostgreSQL and MS SQL connections in SDD job > Filter settings. 

I asked customer which MS SQL servers they wish to scan - they replied that they need to perform SDD scan against these SQL servers:
AZC-MWQASQL-PW1
azsg-t-gldvm07
AZSG-U-SOEDB1
AZC-DIGIDB-UW00
AZSG-Q-DIGIDB2	
azc-digidb-uw00
AZSG-BPSC-VM1
AZSG-P-WEMSUTDB

I asked customer to add these servers to the host list of MS SQL SDD scan job, then run this job and reply to us with results. 

Also asked Damir to join next meeting with customer to confirm if PostgreSQL DB issue is linked to MS SQL DB issue and if the issue with PostgreSQL DB is resolved after upgrade or not.
