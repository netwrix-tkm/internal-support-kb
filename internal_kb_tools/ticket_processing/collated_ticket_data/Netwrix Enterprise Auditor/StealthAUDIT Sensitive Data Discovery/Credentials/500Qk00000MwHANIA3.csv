"500Qk00000MwHANIA3","00438858","Support Ticket","Sensitive Data False Positives not applying","I have added False positives for Passwords in both File path and Network path formats and they are still showing up in the report. I also noticed that when I open the Sensitive Data object under Settings, it says Out of memory. Maybe I have too many objects? I never liked the way it works, where you must specify direct paths and file objects instead of being able to use wildcards.","","For sensitive data false positive exclusion filters:

UNC directly to the file ie:
\HostShareFolderFile.txt

Using the FILE PATH like 
""C:xxxxxxxxx.txt""
does NOT work.

1) We added the following line to the end of the ""Get Shares with SDD"" analysis task on table SA_WS_OpenShares_SDD_Details:

AND mv.IsExcluded = 0

This will allow the WSH_FS_OpenAccessPasswords report to only display entries from the SA_FSDLP_MatchesView that are NOT excluded as SDD False Positives.

2) ""SA_WS_OpenShares_SDD_Details"" is a custom view where they are joining the Open Access table with the SDD Matches table to only show Open Shares with SDD

3) The reason we didn't need to rescan is because SDD False Positives do not mean we aren't scanning them, it just means they are excluded from reports, and it flips that ""IsExcluded"" value on the FSDLP_MatchesView.  Our out-of-the-box reports take that column into account.  Whoever created this report appears to have overlooked this column?  Few customers use false positives, so it is not surprising that it was overlooked.","","+++++
