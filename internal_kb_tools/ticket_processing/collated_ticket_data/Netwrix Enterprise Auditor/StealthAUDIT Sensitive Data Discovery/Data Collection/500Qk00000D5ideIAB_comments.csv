[6/7 10:03 AM] Ethan Israel
if you have differential set to pick up all files modified since previous scan then i think that would work, if the scan encounters a file it hasn't scanned yet it should get picked up, but if you have differential based on a date or date range if the file wasn't modified within that date range it wouldn't get picked up","0054u000006goFBAAY","2024-07-15T16:01:06.000Z","2024-07-15T16:01:06.000Z","false","false"

Describe specifically what the customer is trying to accomplish.

they need to be able to run incremental scans to collect data depth 2 5 so on to remediate in stages 
so once a 2 level scan has completed and we have selected differential scan and since last scan it should be aware that files deeper then level 2 have not been scanned and now scan all files deeper then 2 even if not created after last scan date i confirmed with Ethan that this how it is expected to work
differential scan set not finding all files when set to use last scan date

Desired Outcome:
How should the results appear or be presented to the user?

they should find the same document count of sensitive files as a full depth single scan

1. Add some sensitive data to a rich doc
2. Set the query to target the document type under the Sensitive data setting
3. Unser the SDD Criteria Settings, selected the criteria

2. We’ve seen the excel sheet provided but can you explain this a bit more?  We’ve put our heads together trying to figure out which report/table is generating this but if you can provide more information it will prevent us from guessing.

Scan 0 subfolder depth with differential enabled.


Increase depth to subfolder that includes a sensitive match test file and run scan again.

Confirm in SA_FSDLP_MatchHitsView that no new matches were discovered.

Disable differential scan and scan again.

Confirm in SA_FSDLP_MatchHitsView that file match was discovered.  


Increase scan depth to unlimited and run scan with differential enabled.

Confirm in SA_FSDLP_MatchHitsView that no new file matches were discovered.

Disable differential scan and rescan.

Confirm in SA_FSDLP_MatchHitsView that new file matches were discovered.


Renaming a file in a subfolder that has already been scanned with differential scans enabled appears does not cause the differential scan to catch that new file, e.g. no new matches in SA_FSDLP_MatchHitsView.

New files do not appear to be getting scanned whether created in a new folder that had not been scanned or in a folder that had already been scanned. No difference if FSAA scan is run before or after SEEK scan, though new resources do show up in SA_FSAA_ResourcesView after FSAA scan.

If initial differential scan is unlimited depth files are matched as expected. Adding new folders with new test files we do not get further matches unless differential scan is disabled.


Issue does not appear to impact SPSEEK scans in testing.","0054u000006goFUAAY","2024-07-19T01:08:45.000Z","2024-07-19T01:08:45.000Z","false","false"

@Michael Burrofato @Adam DeSapio @Chris Brooks @Helen Randall @Mike Longo @Robert Minichino @Salesforce - Dev reviewed this case and this behavior is expected. Our file system differential scanning logic only looks at the actual Modified Date of the file, if that modified date is later than the date of the last scan then the file gets scanned. When a file is renamed or copied from a different location the Modified Date does not change so the file would not be picked up by a differential scan. 

This is a known limitation of our differential scanning logic and we have a roadmap item on the backlog to re-work differential scanning to account for scenarios like this.

@Salesforce 
As Paul mentioned, I've been investigating this issue, and I believe the behavior changed with the code updates implemented in version 11.5.0.190. I'm scheduled to discuss this further with the development team tomorrow (8/1). However, I've noticed some discrepancies in the reproduction steps. When I add a file to a scanned location, new files and matches are detected in version 11.6. However, when I copy or rename an existing file, and the ""Date Modified"" remains unchanged, the behavior differs as Paul provided further evidence of. In version 11.5, the system would detect the file, whereas in version 11.6, the file is only mentioned in the applet logs with the message ""Skipping unmodified differential '{NameOfFile}'"". This behavior also occurs when adjusting the scan settings for subfolder depth.
     I intend on having that behavior addressed and was wondering if these are the issues the customer is seeing or the behavior previously mentioned of adding a file in the scanned location and enabling differential scanning.

@Salesforce Hi Nick,

We replicated that behavior before Dev made changes and provided a hotfix, so it seems unrelated to our changes and a benign issue. Other than this reported behavior have new files been added with the new differential scan hotfix implemented?

"00aQk000008x3GbIAI","500Qk00000D5ideIAB","Litte more information in the short term.
In my lab I have 3 test files. I have them in 3 places c:, c:testdata2, and c:testdata2new folder

I started with level 2 scans so it never picked up the copies in new folder. went to level 3. it still did not pick them up post hotfix. 
But then I ran a full scan level 2. and found the 2 sets of 3 files as expected. then I ran a level 3 and it picked up the set of 3 files in the ""new folder""

So it appears post hotfix and a full scan it behaves as expected. however prior to the full scan it was not picking up files it previously skipped.","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-09-06T13:57:52.000Z","2024-09-06T13:57:52.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000008xp58IAA","500Qk00000D5ideIAB","On Escalation Ticket # 00415459 the new comment has been added: Reproduced issue
1. Drop all FSAA data for the host in my lab. T1 and T2.
2. Run a Level 4 scan Permissions.
3. Run non diff SDD Scan at level 2.  (I have data available at levels 1-4 in various test folders)
4. Review results. See expected files at that scan.
5. Run diff SDD at level 4. No new matches or results on subsequent SDD report run.
6. Delete SDD data with Instant Job. I deleted host and Criteria.  FS_SDD_DELETE job.
7. Re run non diff level 2 scan. And it picked up the expected results. 
8. Re run Diff SDD at level 4 again. no new results just like step 5.

Other observations. 
1. If I copy a file from one level to the other say 2 to 3 between scans. It does get picked up as expected. 
2. If I move a file from one level to the other it is ignored.
3. Not the same issue and maybe this would be resolved if I ran perms but after moving files around and rescanning SDD, all records remain in matches even though the files don't exist in original location. SDD_DELETE job remedies this too. 
4. I can run a full scan at level 4 and it picks up all expected files.","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-09-06T21:51:51.000Z","2024-09-06T21:51:51.000Z","false","false"

Confirmed if we drop all data after hotfix/cu update. It works as intended. can do a 0 level full SEEK scan. then do diffs as deep as required and it works.

Customers generally don't want to drop all data but can drop the SEEK data. In order to preserve perms and activity data i did this and it seems to have worked.
This is What I did.
1. deleted all files with ""DLP"" in the name of the t2 files. 
2. Rescanned 0 level full scan FS Seek job and Imported. It gave me the warning ""Tier 2 GUID does not match Tier 2 map GUID, resetting DLP data in order to import""
3. Upped to Diff scan on FS Seek and ran a level 4 depth scan and import successfully.
4. It picked up all SDD data as expected. 

If that is the best way to go about this I will recommend the customer try but wanted to run it past you guys.","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-09-09T14:51:51.000Z","2024-09-09T14:51:51.000Z","false","false"
