We would expect to see a message acknowledging the skip. I scanned the Debug log expecting to see either a file name or file id of sorts to denote that it was skipped but got nothing.

Previously in 11.0 or potentially 11.5 I have results showing that it use to have a warning for those files.","","","","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-10-26T00:15:40.000Z"

Development released a hotfix. We applied it.
It does work however it reports the SDD Temp folder path rather than the original file path, which isn't what the customer wants.

Internal discussions determined customer is frustrated. 
Next steps for us. 
1. Dev to Correct the path outputted.
2. William and customer to determine all files that are skipped for Dev to make sure that each file is marked as skipped in the warnings / log so customer can identify them.","","","","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-12-19T21:27:04.000Z"

Raw details. After correcting scoping from Michaels recommendation on Friday cans are going ok.
Customer has one more scenario they expect to produce a warning that currently doesnt.
PW protected files do warn.
Files within a non PW protected zip are scanned.
However PW protected files in a Non PW protected zip do not throw a warning as would be expected.

This was expressed in an email, just updating ticket.","","","","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-12-23T16:33:43.000Z"
