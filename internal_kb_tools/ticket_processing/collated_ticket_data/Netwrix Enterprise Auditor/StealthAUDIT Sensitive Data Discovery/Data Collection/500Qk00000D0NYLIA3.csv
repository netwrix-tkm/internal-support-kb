StealthAUDIT (SA)                               11.5.0.160 
SA Access Information (AIC)               11.5.0.108

CrowdStrike                                           7.15.18513.0

Found that the SEEK Scan ERROR was related to long path of 300+ char.

We enabled the HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem for  LongPathsEnabled = 1 
***NOTED*** This requires a reboot  ***RECOMMENDED*** Setting this value on the Windows File Server as well.

Found that the StealthAUDIT Web Server (StealthAUDITWeb) was not running which prevented the site from loading when the AIC was working as expected.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix server","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT Sensitive Data Discovery","Data Collection","11.5","160","5.1","Closed - Resolved","CTBC Bank","Javier Gomez","2024-07-12T17:46:47.000Z","2024-07-17T19:17:34.000Z"
