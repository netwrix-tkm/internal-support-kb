@Michael Burrofato @Chris Brooks @Ethan Israel @Helen Randall @Salesforce
In order to figure out why the warning is not getting sent, we will need SDD scanner lib logs and FSAA applet logs. One reason this behavior might be getting observed is that there is another reason we failed to parse the file for sensitive data before trying to access the file, where we would normally get the password protected warning.

Since job is still collecting the information it can, and the only issue being observed is that a message is not getting displayed, would we be able to reduce the priority on this issue?

The logs folder uploaded do not contain the logs we requested. Please provide all logs that are in the FSAA target host folder with the prefix SDD, both the applet and scanner lib logs start with this prefix. For example ""SDD_[Target Host]_[Year]_[Month]_[Day]_[Time]_[GUID]_0_[PID]_ScannerLib_*"" is the naming convention used for the scanner lib logs.

@Salesforce @Helen Randall @Michael Longo @Michael Burrofato - relaying from out of band discussion in outlook:

Dev identified a potential bug this morning with how FSAA is interacting with Tika that's likely causing Scenario 1 (warning on a pw protected file within a zip) to fail. Dev is actively looking into a fix, but we need to take the time to implement the fix properly and for QA to thoroughly test this rather than rushing it, so we can avoid any further issues and frustration for an already hot customer.

This is the top priority for our team right now, but we're light on QA and dev resources this week due to people taking time off for the holidays, so we won't be able to get this fully implemented,  tested, and delivered this week. We should be back up to full strength next week and expect to have a fix for this delivered in next friday's (1/3/25) CU.
