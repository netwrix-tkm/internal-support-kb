Dusty,

I ended the task and was going to scan just one server, BR29HQFS, but it has the status Offline:
[cid:image008.png@01DAD473.D0393AB0]

I know the server is online, because I connected to it and confirmed it has the SAM agent installed:
[cid:image001.png@01DAD474.2F798980]

It is also the SAM with no error:
[cid:image002.png@01DAD474.2F798980]

Please advise how to fix the Offline status in StealthAudit hosts.

Sincerely,

I was trying to run the Sensitive Data scan, and it started.  I disconnected (not logged off) my RDP session to the server, then checked on it a few hours later, but now StealthAudit is not responding:



 

Here’s a screenshot of the Task Manager:



 

Not sure if I should end task and start over, or wait to see it starts responding.

 

Please advise.

Javier,


Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object |  Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 
#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

Could I also get a screenshot of the Applications License details?

Ref-image if needed:



Thank You for your time.

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

StealthAUDIT (SA)                               11.5.0.160 
SA Access Information (AIC)               11.5.0.108    
SA Sensitive Data (SDD)                      11.5.0.51   
Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM)      6.0.1111 
CrowdStrike                                           7.15.18513.0

Found that the SEEK Scan ERROR was related to long path of 300+ char.

We enabled the HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem for  LongPathsEnabled = 1 
***NOTED*** This requires a reboot  ***RECOMMENDED*** Setting this value on the Windows File Server as well.

Found that the StealthAUDIT Web Server (StealthAUDITWeb) was not running which prevented the site from loading when the AIC was working as expected.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Dusty,

 

I ended the task and was going to scan just one server, BR29HQFS, but it has the status Offline:



 

I know the server is online, because I connected to it and confirmed it has the SAM agent installed:




 

It is also the SAM with no error:



 

Please advise how to fix the Offline status in StealthAudit hosts.

 

Sincerely,

I ended the task and was going to scan just one server, BR29HQFS, but it has the status Offline:

I know the server is online, because I connected to it and confirmed it has the SAM agent installed:

I was trying to run the Sensitive Data scan, and it started.  I disconnected (not logged off) my RDP session to the server, then checked on it a few hours later, but now StealthAudit is not responding:

Javier,


Thank you for reaching out to support.

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability.
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize
#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR

Could I also get a screenshot of the Applications License details?

Ref-image if needed:

Javier,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

StealthAUDIT (SA)                               11.5.0.160 
SA Access Information (AIC)               11.5.0.108    
SA Sensitive Data (SDD)                      11.5.0.51   
Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM)      6.0.1111 
CrowdStrike                                           7.15.18513.0

Found that the SEEK Scan ERROR was related to long path of 300+ char.

We enabled the HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem for  LongPathsEnabled = 1 
***NOTED*** This requires a reboot  ***RECOMMENDED*** Setting this value on the Windows File Server as well.

Found that the StealthAUDIT Web Server (StealthAUDITWeb) was not running which prevented the site from loading when the AIC was working as expected.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Dusty,

 

I ended the task and was going to scan just one server, BR29HQFS, but it has the status Offline:



 

I know the server is online, because I connected to it and confirmed it has the SAM agent installed:




 

It is also the SAM with no error:



 

Please advise how to fix the Offline status in StealthAudit hosts.
