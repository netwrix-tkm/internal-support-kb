Also discovered a known bug associated with .Net Framework versions 4.0 and 4.8 within Event Viewer. Have acquired screenshots of the error messages and will provide them to development for a possible hotfix or CU update..

"00aQk000008OwPdIAK","500Qk00000BwzBLIAZ","We performed a standard NEA platform upgrade to 11.6.0.88 to target a .Net Framework issue that was addressed. We also discovered that there were no issues when completely allowing a job to gracely end before starting a new job scan. This was apparent by the discovery of another running.lck file existing in the SDD job group file path. We recommended two options for scheduling these scans as tasks, running the entire job group itself and allowing each job to run in sequential order or individually running each scan with a 2 to 3 minute offset from each other.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-08-07T19:37:58.000Z","2024-08-07T19:37:58.000Z","false","false"

"00aQk00000966gfIAA","500Qk00000BwzBLIAZ","Was able to import the SQL jobs from the production environment successfully. Identified that the SQL Sensitive Data scan errors were associated with not having the SDD application installed. Resolved this error by installing the SDD application to the server and running the scans again. The SQL job group was successfully able to initialize and start scanning objects. Identified that there were some AIC import errors but these errors are directly correlated to not having the AIC installed on the server. Once the AIC is installed these errors will be resolved. We also verified that the .Net error reported on the production server was non-existent on this server during the time of the scheduled tasks and has not aborted the scheduled job. 

We decided to allow the scan to run over the weekend to monitor the progression of it.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-09-13T22:44:55.000Z","2024-09-13T22:44:55.000Z","false","false"

Reviewed the job logs after the SQL job group with the full hosts list. We identified an access violation error pointing to a ntdll.dll file. We attempted to run the SQL permission scan job again a couple of hosts and we were successful in completing those scans.

We then created a new hosts list with only 23 hosts. We then adjusted the performance of the SQL permissions scan to only 10 threads and started the scan again to monitor the 23 hosts being scanned. 

Our next steps are:

You will:

Monitor the scan job for the 23 hosts. If the job is successful please add the full host list to the SQL permissions scan and run the job group again with the modified performance settings.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-09-19T23:23:22.000Z","2024-09-19T23:23:22.000Z","false","false"

Reviewed changes that were made to the new NEA application server. 

Modified the SQL permissions scan and SQL sensitive data scan performance settings to from 30 threads to 10 threads. Increased the timeout for the permission scans to 120 minutes. Decreased the SQL-sensitive data scan threads from 10 to 4 threads.

Created a new scheduled task for the SQL 0. collections job group to only scan one host list to allow for efficient scans to successfully run and complete.
