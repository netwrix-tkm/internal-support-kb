Hello Scottie,

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened.

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

Please advise

Hello,
According to the documentation: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/Databases/SQL/Collection/2-SQL_SensitiveDataScan.htm
The only dependency for SQL seems to be having the Sensitive data scan on the audit server. The Add-on on the target looks like a requirement for a filesystem scan, which we don't need at this time.

We are thinking this could be related to the recent upgrade to the newest version.
Could we get Kurt Gerth to help us with this ticket? as he guided us through that process.

Regards

Hello Scottie,

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened.

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

Please advise

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We investigated the reported issue and discovered that the service account being used for the targeted job reported an ""Access Denied"" error under the task stats section. Please verify the access of the selected service account to the reported DCs and attempt to run the job once more. Please let me know the results of the job.

Thank you,

Hello,

According to the documentation: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/Databases/SQL/Collection/2-SQL_SensitiveDataScan.htm

The only dependency for SQL seems to be having the Sensitive data scan on the audit server. The Add-on on the target looks like a requirement for a filesystem scan, which we don't need at this time.

 

We are thinking this could be related to the recent upgrade to the newest version.

Could we get Kurt Gerth to help us with this ticket? as he guided us through that process.

 

Regards

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We discovered that the Sensitive Data add on needed to be installed to the target hosts for sensitive data scans. I've provided documentation on how to configure those jobs as well as installing the SDD add on.

Please let me know if you have any additional issues.

Hello,

the manual run for 1 host finished after 6 hours, log attached and zipped; outlook won't let me send large files.
On the other hand, the scheduled job that ran after that lasted just a couple of minutes and is incomplete, attached the log from the 28th.

A concern I have is that the scheduled SQL job group execution is currently taking 5-6 hours as is; I'm worried that when the Sensitive Data scan is fixed, it will double the time it takes to finish its execution.

Hello Scottie,

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened.

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

Hello,

 

the manual run for 1 host finished after 6 hours, log attached and zipped; outlook won't let me send large files.

On the other hand, the scheduled job that ran after that lasted just a couple of minutes and is incomplete, attached the log from the 28th.

 

A concern I have is that the scheduled SQL job group execution is currently taking 5-6 hours as is; I'm worried that when the Sensitive Data scan is fixed, it will double the time it takes to finish its execution.

 

Regards

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Ran a test SQL SDD scan against test hosts. Verified that the job seems to run successfully and did not throw any errors during our meeting time. Run the full scan from the scheduled tasks targeting the production hosts and provide an update.

Hello Scottie, 

 

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

 

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened. 

 

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

 

Please advise

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We investigated the reported issue and discovered that the service account being used for the targeted job reported an ""Access Denied"" error under the task stats section. Please verify the access of the selected service account to the reported DCs and attempt to run the job once more. Please let me know the results of the job.

Thank you,

Hello scottie,
yes, as seen in the attached log file(2-SQL_SensitiveDataScan_Log_20240628_121400.zip), the execution that scanned one host had multiple error messages, none of which stopped the execution, The log has an end date.

The scheduled job again stopped logging as you can see on the other attached log in the last email; I would expect to at least log the errors and the end date if it is stopping due to a connection issue.

Another thing I'm finding is that all logs stop at midnight or minutes close to midnight, what's happening there, I'm checking on the server side and also will check if we can schedule the job earlier, so it doesn't run between 2 days.

Not sure what else I should do.

Hello,

the manual run for 1 host finished after 6 hours, log attached and zipped; outlook won't let me send large files.
On the other hand, the scheduled job that ran after that lasted just a couple of minutes and is incomplete, attached the log from the 28th.

A concern I have is that the scheduled SQL job group execution is currently taking 5-6 hours as is; I'm worried that when the Sensitive Data scan is fixed, it will double the time it takes to finish its execution.

Hello Scottie,

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened.

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

Please advise

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We investigated the reported issue and discovered that the service account being used for the targeted job reported an ""Access Denied"" error under the task stats section. Please verify the access of the selected service account to the reported DCs and attempt to run the job once more. Please let me know the results of the job.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hello scottie, 

yes, as seen in the attached log file(2-SQL_SensitiveDataScan_Log_20240628_121400.zip), the execution that scanned one host had multiple error messages, none of which stopped the execution, The log has an end date.

 

The scheduled job again stopped logging as you can see on the other attached log in the last email; I would expect to at least log the errors and the end date if it is stopping due to a connection issue.

 

Another thing I'm finding is that all logs stop at midnight or minutes close to midnight, what's happening there, I'm checking on the server side and also will check if we can schedule the job earlier, so it doesn't run between 2 days.

 

Not sure what else I should do.

Hello,

 

the manual run for 1 host finished after 6 hours, log attached and zipped; outlook won't let me send large files.

On the other hand, the scheduled job that ran after that lasted just a couple of minutes and is incomplete, attached the log from the 28th.

 

A concern I have is that the scheduled SQL job group execution is currently taking 5-6 hours as is; I'm worried that when the Sensitive Data scan is fixed, it will double the time it takes to finish its execution.

 

Regards

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Ran a test SQL SDD scan against test hosts. Verified that the job seems to run successfully and did not throw any errors during our meeting time. Run the full scan from the scheduled tasks targeting the production hosts and provide an update.

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We discovered that the Sensitive Data add on needed to be installed to the target hosts for sensitive data scans. I've provided documentation on how to configure those jobs as well as installing the SDD add on.

Hello Scottie,

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened.

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

Please advise

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We investigated the reported issue and discovered that the service account being used for the targeted job reported an ""Access Denied"" error under the task stats section. Please verify the access of the selected service account to the reported DCs and attempt to run the job once more. Please let me know the results of the job.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hello scottie, 

yes, as seen in the attached log file(2-SQL_SensitiveDataScan_Log_20240628_121400.zip), the execution that scanned one host had multiple error messages, none of which stopped the execution, The log has an end date.

 

The scheduled job again stopped logging as you can see on the other attached log in the last email; I would expect to at least log the errors and the end date if it is stopping due to a connection issue.

 

Another thing I'm finding is that all logs stop at midnight or minutes close to midnight, what's happening there, I'm checking on the server side and also will check if we can schedule the job earlier, so it doesn't run between 2 days.

 

Not sure what else I should do.

Hello,

 

the manual run for 1 host finished after 6 hours, log attached and zipped; outlook won't let me send large files.

On the other hand, the scheduled job that ran after that lasted just a couple of minutes and is incomplete, attached the log from the 28th.

 

A concern I have is that the scheduled SQL job group execution is currently taking 5-6 hours as is; I'm worried that when the Sensitive Data scan is fixed, it will double the time it takes to finish its execution.

 

Regards

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Ran a test SQL SDD scan against test hosts. Verified that the job seems to run successfully and did not throw any errors during our meeting time. Run the full scan from the scheduled tasks targeting the production hosts and provide an update.

Thank you,

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We discovered that the Sensitive Data add on needed to be installed to the target hosts for sensitive data scans. I've provided documentation on how to configure those jobs as well as installing the SDD add on.

Please let me know if you have any additional issues.

Thank you,

Hello,

the manual run for 1 host finished after 6 hours, log attached and zipped; outlook won't let me send large files.
On the other hand, the scheduled job that ran after that lasted just a couple of minutes and is incomplete, attached the log from the 28th.

A concern I have is that the scheduled SQL job group execution is currently taking 5-6 hours as is; I'm worried that when the Sensitive Data scan is fixed, it will double the time it takes to finish its execution.

Regards

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Ran a test SQL SDD scan against test hosts. Verified that the job seems to run successfully and did not throw any errors during our meeting time. Run the full scan from the scheduled tasks targeting the production hosts and provide an update.

Thank you,

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We discovered that the Sensitive Data add on needed to be installed to the target hosts for sensitive data scans. I've provided documentation on how to configure those jobs as well as installing the SDD add on.

Please let me know if you have any additional issues.

Thank you,

Hello Scottie,

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened.

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

Please advise

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We investigated the reported issue and discovered that the service account being used for the targeted job reported an ""Access Denied"" error under the task stats section. Please verify the access of the selected service account to the reported DCs and attempt to run the job once more. Please let me know the results of the job.

Thank you,

Hello again, we're now seeing this error message when the scheduled job runs and it gets stuck in there for hours.



Should we delete that SA_SQLServer_Instance object?

 

Thanks!

It will display the same path structure for the job group as the scheduled task. If there isn't one in task manager then right-click on the scheduled task and stop the job.

Try checking the details tab under task manager for a StealthAudit process running using that SQL job group. The job may still be running but there could be a UI issue.

Hello scottie, 

yes, as seen in the attached log file(2-SQL_SensitiveDataScan_Log_20240628_121400.zip), the execution that scanned one host had multiple error messages, none of which stopped the execution, The log has an end date.

 

The scheduled job again stopped logging as you can see on the other attached log in the last email; I would expect to at least log the errors and the end date if it is stopping due to a connection issue.

 

Another thing I'm finding is that all logs stop at midnight or minutes close to midnight, what's happening there, I'm checking on the server side and also will check if we can schedule the job earlier, so it doesn't run between 2 days.

 

Not sure what else I should do.

What job is this error being displayed under?

Is this associated with the original job that was running for 6 hours?

Hello again, we're now seeing this error message when the scheduled job runs and it gets stuck in there for hours.
[cid:70c1006c-0e3b-47a5-9e85-2bd1b758e17e@Image_0_]
Should we delete that SA_SQLServer_Instance object?

Thanks!

Hello scottie,
yes, as seen in the attached log file(2-SQL_SensitiveDataScan_Log_20240628_121400.zip), the execution that scanned one host had multiple error messages, none of which stopped the execution, The log has an end date.

The scheduled job again stopped logging as you can see on the other attached log in the last email; I would expect to at least log the errors and the end date if it is stopping due to a connection issue.

Another thing I'm finding is that all logs stop at midnight or minutes close to midnight, what's happening there, I'm checking on the server side and also will check if we can schedule the job earlier, so it doesn't run between 2 days.

Not sure what else I should do.

Hello,

the manual run for 1 host finished after 6 hours, log attached and zipped; outlook won't let me send large files.
On the other hand, the scheduled job that ran after that lasted just a couple of minutes and is incomplete, attached the log from the 28th.

A concern I have is that the scheduled SQL job group execution is currently taking 5-6 hours as is; I'm worried that when the Sensitive Data scan is fixed, it will double the time it takes to finish its execution.

Regards

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Ran a test SQL SDD scan against test hosts. Verified that the job seems to run successfully and did not throw any errors during our meeting time. Run the full scan from the scheduled tasks targeting the production hosts and provide an update.

Thank you,

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We discovered that the Sensitive Data add on needed to be installed to the target hosts for sensitive data scans. I've provided documentation on how to configure those jobs as well as installing the SDD add on.

Please let me know if you have any additional issues.

Thank you,

Hello Scottie,

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened.

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

Please advise

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We investigated the reported issue and discovered that the service account being used for the targeted job reported an ""Access Denied"" error under the task stats section. Please verify the access of the selected service account to the reported DCs and attempt to run the job once more. Please let me know the results of the job.

Thank you,

Hello, 

It is the 0-SQL Drop (log attached),doesn't even get to the Sensitive Data anymore.

 

 Here's some screenshots of the errors on ""history"", (all hosts are showing the same error message as WFO-DB.MYBOFI.LOCAL)







 

This is how the ""current"" tab looks 



 

Rest of jobs haven't run yet, as they're still on queue:

yes, as seen in the attached log file(2-SQL_SensitiveDataScan_Log_20240628_121400.zip), the execution that scanned one host had multiple error messages, none of which stopped the execution, The log has an end date.

 

The scheduled job again stopped logging as you can see on the other attached log in the last email; I would expect to at least log the errors and the end date if it is stopping due to a connection issue.

 

Another thing I'm finding is that all logs stop at midnight or minutes close to midnight, what's happening there, I'm checking on the server side and also will check if we can schedule the job earlier, so it doesn't run between 2 days.

 

Not sure what else I should do.

From the look of the screenshot presented it still seems as though there was no access or it aborted. These jobs can be time consuming depending on the amount of data that needs to be scanned. Are there any errors in the initial job that ran for 6 hours?

Thank you,

Hello,

 

the manual run for 1 host finished after 6 hours, log attached and zipped; outlook won't let me send large files.

On the other hand, the scheduled job that ran after that lasted just a couple of minutes and is incomplete, attached the log from the 28th.

 

A concern I have is that the scheduled SQL job group execution is currently taking 5-6 hours as is; I'm worried that when the Sensitive Data scan is fixed, it will double the time it takes to finish its execution.

 

Regards

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Ran a test SQL SDD scan against test hosts. Verified that the job seems to run successfully and did not throw any errors during our meeting time. Run the full scan from the scheduled tasks targeting the production hosts and provide an update.

Thank you,

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We discovered that the Sensitive Data add on needed to be installed to the target hosts for sensitive data scans. I've provided documentation on how to configure those jobs as well as installing the SDD add on.

Please let me know if you have any additional issues.

Hello Scottie, 

 

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

 

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened. 

 

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

 

Please advise

Hello, 

It is the 0-SQL Drop (log attached),doesn't even get to the Sensitive Data anymore.

 

 Here's some screenshots of the errors on ""history"", (all hosts are showing the same error message as WFO-DB.MYBOFI.LOCAL)







 

This is how the ""current"" tab looks 



 

Rest of jobs haven't run yet, as they're still on queue:

Hello again, we're now seeing this error message when the scheduled job runs and it gets stuck in there for hours.



Should we delete that SA_SQLServer_Instance object?

It will display the same path structure for the job group as the scheduled task. If there isn't one in task manager then right-click on the scheduled task and stop the job.

Try checking the details tab under task manager for a StealthAudit process running using that SQL job group. The job may still be running but there could be a UI issue.

Hello team,

Sensitive Data scan was aborted again, this time it doesn't even show the start date:
[cid:3d77a35d-5cf7-4e47-95b8-3f9ec04f2eaa]
None of the tasks were completed:
[cid:4662e79b-68c9-43a6-9c70-34cf8223a875]
This is the only message logged:[cid:43798610-258e-4559-a785-b1fc7a3df4f8]
Seems like it failed immediately:
[cid:8904d114-ffb8-4dea-bf53-cbe482e860a6]
In summary;  seems like the scheduled job failed at the same time as always (close to midnight) and didn't last more than 7 hours.
You'll find the logs attached.

Please advise.

Regards

Hi Alan A.,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We increased the timeout of the SQL storage connection time to accommodate the longer running SQL permissions and SDD scans.

Please let me know the results of the job scan.

Thank you,

It is the 0-SQL Drop (log attached),doesn't even get to the Sensitive Data anymore.

 Here's some screenshots of the errors on ""history"", (all hosts are showing the same error message as WFO-DB.MYBOFI.LOCAL)

Try checking the details tab under task manager for a StealthAudit process running using that SQL job group. The job may still be running but there could be a UI issue.

Hello scottie,
yes, as seen in the attached log file(2-SQL_SensitiveDataScan_Log_20240628_121400.zip), the execution that scanned one host had multiple error messages, none of which stopped the execution, The log has an end date.

The scheduled job again stopped logging as you can see on the other attached log in the last email; I would expect to at least log the errors and the end date if it is stopping due to a connection issue.

Another thing I'm finding is that all logs stop at midnight or minutes close to midnight, what's happening there, I'm checking on the server side and also will check if we can schedule the job earlier, so it doesn't run between 2 days.

Not sure what else I should do.

Hello,

the manual run for 1 host finished after 6 hours, log attached and zipped; outlook won't let me send large files.
On the other hand, the scheduled job that ran after that lasted just a couple of minutes and is incomplete, attached the log from the 28th.

A concern I have is that the scheduled SQL job group execution is currently taking 5-6 hours as is; I'm worried that when the Sensitive Data scan is fixed, it will double the time it takes to finish its execution.

Regards

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Ran a test SQL SDD scan against test hosts. Verified that the job seems to run successfully and did not throw any errors during our meeting time. Run the full scan from the scheduled tasks targeting the production hosts and provide an update.

Thank you,

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We discovered that the Sensitive Data add on needed to be installed to the target hosts for sensitive data scans. I've provided documentation on how to configure those jobs as well as installing the SDD add on.

Please let me know if you have any additional issues.

Hello Scottie,

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened.

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

Please advise

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We investigated the reported issue and discovered that the service account being used for the targeted job reported an ""Access Denied"" error under the task stats section. Please verify the access of the selected service account to the reported DCs and attempt to run the job once more. Please let me know the results of the job.

Hello team,

 

Sensitive Data scan was aborted again, this time it doesn't even show the start date:



None of the tasks were completed:



This is the only message logged:

Seems like it failed immediately:



In summary;  seems like the scheduled job failed at the same time as always (close to midnight) and didn't last more than 7 hours.

You'll find the logs attached.

 

Please advise.

Hello, 

It is the 0-SQL Drop (log attached),doesn't even get to the Sensitive Data anymore.

 

 Here's some screenshots of the errors on ""history"", (all hosts are showing the same error message as WFO-DB.MYBOFI.LOCAL)







 

This is how the ""current"" tab looks 



 

Rest of jobs haven't run yet, as they're still on queue:

Is this associated with the original job that was running for 6 hours?

Hello again, we're now seeing this error message when the scheduled job runs and it gets stuck in there for hours.



Should we delete that SA_SQLServer_Instance object?

It will display the same path structure for the job group as the scheduled task. If there isn't one in task manager then right-click on the scheduled task and stop the job.

Try checking the details tab under task manager for a StealthAudit process running using that SQL job group. The job may still be running but there could be a UI issue.

Hello scottie, 

yes, as seen in the attached log file(2-SQL_SensitiveDataScan_Log_20240628_121400.zip), the execution that scanned one host had multiple error messages, none of which stopped the execution, The log has an end date.

 

The scheduled job again stopped logging as you can see on the other attached log in the last email; I would expect to at least log the errors and the end date if it is stopping due to a connection issue.

 

Another thing I'm finding is that all logs stop at midnight or minutes close to midnight, what's happening there, I'm checking on the server side and also will check if we can schedule the job earlier, so it doesn't run between 2 days.

 

Not sure what else I should do.

Hello,

 

the manual run for 1 host finished after 6 hours, log attached and zipped; outlook won't let me send large files.

On the other hand, the scheduled job that ran after that lasted just a couple of minutes and is incomplete, attached the log from the 28th.

 

A concern I have is that the scheduled SQL job group execution is currently taking 5-6 hours as is; I'm worried that when the Sensitive Data scan is fixed, it will double the time it takes to finish its execution.

 

Regards

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Ran a test SQL SDD scan against test hosts. Verified that the job seems to run successfully and did not throw any errors during our meeting time. Run the full scan from the scheduled tasks targeting the production hosts and provide an update.

Thank you,

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We discovered that the Sensitive Data add on needed to be installed to the target hosts for sensitive data scans. I've provided documentation on how to configure those jobs as well as installing the SDD add on.

Please let me know if you have any additional issues.

Hello Scottie, 

 

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

 

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened. 

 

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

 

Please advise

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We investigated the reported issue and discovered that the service account being used for the targeted job reported an ""Access Denied"" error under the task stats section. Please verify the access of the selected service account to the reported DCs and attempt to run the job once more. Please let me know the results of the job.

Hello, 

It is the 0-SQL Drop (log attached),doesn't even get to the Sensitive Data anymore.

 

 Here's some screenshots of the errors on ""history"", (all hosts are showing the same error message as WFO-DB.MYBOFI.LOCAL)







 

This is how the ""current"" tab looks 



 

Rest of jobs haven't run yet, as they're still on queue:

What job is this error being displayed under?

Is this associated with the original job that was running for 6 hours?

Thank you,

Hello again, we're now seeing this error message when the scheduled job runs and it gets stuck in there for hours.



Should we delete that SA_SQLServer_Instance object?

 

Thanks!

It will display the same path structure for the job group as the scheduled task. If there isn't one in task manager then right-click on the scheduled task and stop the job.

Thank you,

Seems that there are some active processes, how can I check if they're using that sql jobgroup?

Try checking the details tab under task manager for a StealthAudit process running using that SQL job group. The job may still be running but there could be a UI issue.

Hello scottie, 

yes, as seen in the attached log file(2-SQL_SensitiveDataScan_Log_20240628_121400.zip), the execution that scanned one host had multiple error messages, none of which stopped the execution, The log has an end date.

 

The scheduled job again stopped logging as you can see on the other attached log in the last email; I would expect to at least log the errors and the end date if it is stopping due to a connection issue.

 

Another thing I'm finding is that all logs stop at midnight or minutes close to midnight, what's happening there, I'm checking on the server side and also will check if we can schedule the job earlier, so it doesn't run between 2 days.

 

Not sure what else I should do.

From the look of the screenshot presented it still seems as though there was no access or it aborted. These jobs can be time consuming depending on the amount of data that needs to be scanned. Are there any errors in the initial job that ran for 6 hours?

Hello,

 

the manual run for 1 host finished after 6 hours, log attached and zipped; outlook won't let me send large files.

On the other hand, the scheduled job that ran after that lasted just a couple of minutes and is incomplete, attached the log from the 28th.

 

A concern I have is that the scheduled SQL job group execution is currently taking 5-6 hours as is; I'm worried that when the Sensitive Data scan is fixed, it will double the time it takes to finish its execution.

 

Regards

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Ran a test SQL SDD scan against test hosts. Verified that the job seems to run successfully and did not throw any errors during our meeting time. Run the full scan from the scheduled tasks targeting the production hosts and provide an update.

Thank you,

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We discovered that the Sensitive Data add on needed to be installed to the target hosts for sensitive data scans. I've provided documentation on how to configure those jobs as well as installing the SDD add on.

Please let me know if you have any additional issues.

Thank you,

Hello Scottie, 

 

After looking into it, looks like the accounts were being granted access with other users from the connection profile, except for the decommissioned ones which I already removed from the hostlist.

 

I went and created a hostlist with just one host that should be working fine and ran the jobgroup and got the same results; Sensitive data scan didn't even run. I tried to run it manually, but nothing happened. 

 

It's weird because the following jobs ran fine or at least have entries on the log, but SD scan doesn't, and when I run it manually it doesn't appear on ""running instances"" either

 

Please advise

Hi Alan,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We investigated the reported issue and discovered that the service account being used for the targeted job reported an ""Access Denied"" error under the task stats section. Please verify the access of the selected service account to the reported DCs and attempt to run the job once more. Please let me know the results of the job.

Thank you,
