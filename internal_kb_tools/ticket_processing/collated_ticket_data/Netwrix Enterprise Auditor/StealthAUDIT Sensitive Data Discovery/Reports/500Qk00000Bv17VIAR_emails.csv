Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support.

This job is a simple inner join of SA_FSDLP_MatchesView and SA_FSAA_ResourcesView. The execution time may proportionally increase when you have a lot of Sensitive Data Criteria matches. 

Can you count the rows of the join results by running the query below in SQL Server Management Studio and share the results?

Make sure the correct Database is selected or you can add USE ""change_to_your_StealthAUDIT_database_name"" before the SELECT statement:

SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM (select res.* from [SA_FSDLP_MatchesView] as res ) as SourceTable1 INNER join (select res.* from [SA_FSAA_ResourcesView] as res ) as SourceTable2 on ([SourceTable1].[ResourceID] = [SourceTable2].[ID])
WHERE (""SourceTable2"".""DeletedUSN"" is null)

Thank you for the reply.

I've optimized the script excluding the subqueries, and added the DROP VIEW of SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result before generating a new one.

The original SQL script was:

CREATE VIEW [SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result] AS
SELECT   [SourceTable1].[HostName], [SourceTable1].[CriteriaName], [SourceTable1].[FileName], [SourceTable1].[FilePath], [SourceTable1].[MatchCount]
FROM (select res.*  from [SA_FSDLP_MatchesView] as res ) as SourceTable1 INNER join (select res.*  from [SA_FSAA_ResourcesView] as res ) as SourceTable2 on ([SourceTable1].[ResourceID] = [SourceTable2].[ID])
WHERE (""SourceTable2"".""DeletedUSN"" is null)

I've changed it to:

IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result') AND type in (N'V'))
DROP VIEW SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result

GO

CREATE VIEW [SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result] AS
SELECT mv.[HostName], mv.[CriteriaName], mv.[FileName], mv.[FilePath], mv.[MatchCount]
FROM dbo.SA_FSDLP_MatchesView mv
JOIN dbo.SA_FSAA_ResourcesView rv ON mv.ResourceID = rv.ID
WHERE rv.DeletedUSN IS NULL

Glad to see that works faster now.

If you don't have any questions I will mark this ticket for closure.
You can always open a new ticket or respond to this within 30 days if any related issues return.

Hi James,

Thank you for the reply.

How many hosts are reporting for the Actual Sensitive Data job?

Can you try to run this rewritten query in SSMS directly? How long it will take?

SELECT mv.[HostName], mv.[CriteriaName], mv.[FileName], mv.[FilePath], mv.[MatchCount]
FROM dbo.SA_FSDLP_MatchesView mv
JOIN dbo.SA_FSAA_ResourcesView rv ON mv.ResourceID = rv.ID
WHERE rv.DeletedUSN IS NULL

Best regards,

Hi James,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support.

This job is a simple inner join of SA_FSDLP_MatchesView and SA_FSAA_ResourcesView. The execution time may proportionally increase when you have a lot of Sensitive Data Criteria matches. 

Can you count the rows of the join results by running the query below in SQL Server Management Studio and share the results?

Make sure the correct Database is selected or you can add USE ""change_to_your_StealthAUDIT_database_name"" before the SELECT statement:

SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM (select res.* from [SA_FSDLP_MatchesView] as res ) as SourceTable1 INNER join (select res.* from [SA_FSAA_ResourcesView] as res ) as SourceTable2 on ([SourceTable1].[ResourceID] = [SourceTable2].[ID])
WHERE (""SourceTable2"".""DeletedUSN"" is null)

Best regards,

Hi James,

Thank you for the reply.

I've optimized the script excluding the subqueries, and added the DROP VIEW of SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result before generating a new one.

The original SQL script was:

CREATE VIEW [SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result] AS
SELECT   [SourceTable1].[HostName], [SourceTable1].[CriteriaName], [SourceTable1].[FileName], [SourceTable1].[FilePath], [SourceTable1].[MatchCount]
FROM (select res.*  from [SA_FSDLP_MatchesView] as res ) as SourceTable1 INNER join (select res.*  from [SA_FSAA_ResourcesView] as res ) as SourceTable2 on ([SourceTable1].[ResourceID] = [SourceTable2].[ID])
WHERE (""SourceTable2"".""DeletedUSN"" is null)

I've changed it to:

IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.objects WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'[dbo].SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result') AND type in (N'V'))
DROP VIEW SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result

GO

CREATE VIEW [SA_Active_Sensitive_Data_Result] AS
SELECT mv.[HostName], mv.[CriteriaName], mv.[FileName], mv.[FilePath], mv.[MatchCount]
FROM dbo.SA_FSDLP_MatchesView mv
JOIN dbo.SA_FSAA_ResourcesView rv ON mv.ResourceID = rv.ID
WHERE rv.DeletedUSN IS NULL

Glad to see that works faster now.

If you don't have any questions I will mark this ticket for closure.
You can always open a new ticket or respond to this within 30 days if any related issues return.

Hi James,

Thank you for the reply.

As you have a lot of Sensitive Data matches the the result query may be running a bit long.

Can you try this job copy? You can download it here: Assystem<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/nwxcorp-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/aleksandr_timofeev_netwrix_com/Eqdxp9TqKlpFhDhnMhMSSqkBQtURAs6Vms8VH6OVsZP4Sg?email=jaallen-ext*40assystem.com&e=i5hiyL__;JQ!!GDyMDYbfvpeH7A!UQUPDuQBMqZdOrre4LI5zH4ruju2KQHjN4_aExaEkTXyqwMUHbb1m7StueUkW8m5SmQkKKIjzrQL8DSkEqUjnB_AX_Q$>.

I've changed the SQL Analysis including the script I sent you yesterday. Please run this job and check if you see the ""Slow Thread"" message again.
