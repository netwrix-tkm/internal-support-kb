We began receiving 'Invalid length parameter passed to the LEFT or SUBSTRING function. This statement has been terminated.' error on the 1. Resolve links analysis task on the FSAA System Scans job ever since we successfully got the 3. Nasuni analysis task on the FSAA Bulk Import job to succeed. We also ran their 0-FSDFS System Scans job for the first time before we started getting those errors.

Their SA_FSDFS_Links table contains the inserted entries from their Nasuni filers as well as some of the dfs namespaces found via the 0-FSDFS System Scans job.
- For the Nasuni entries there are unique rows for each of them each with their own unique HOST, ID, and NamespaceID. The NamespaceName and DfsPath for each of the Nasuni entries is in this format '\NASUNIFILERFQDN$'. The Nasuni entries each have the same DfsResourceID and their DfsHostID is different and matching the HOST column values. Each of the Nasuni entries has '\DEDICATEDNASUNIEDGEAPPLIANCEFQDN' in the TargetPath column. None of the Nasuni entries have any values for the TargetHostID, TargetGateID, TargetResourceID, State, Timeout, and DfsGuid columns.
- For the non-Nasuni dfs namespace entries, they seem mostly normal except having null values for the DfsResourceID, DfsHostID, TargetHostID, TargetGateID, and TargetResourceID columns.

I do believe they were receiving a number of errors scanning the identified dfs hosts using the scoped dfs scans with FSAA due to not having permissions setup for our scan account to those servers. I'm not sure if the fact we are scanning those properly might be causing issues, or with how we insert the Nasuni filer entries into the dfs tables with the 3. Nasuni analysis task being the problem. I've attached the screenshot of the data we could see from that table to the ticket.

Seems like dev is planning to take this on to be reviewed on upcoming sprint (2/19).","","","","0054u000008ATVZAA4","2025-02-13T16:10:36.000Z"
