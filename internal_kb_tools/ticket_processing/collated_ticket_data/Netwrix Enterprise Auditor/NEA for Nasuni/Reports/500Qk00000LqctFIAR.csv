"500Qk00000LqctFIAR","00435774","Support Ticket","Error on 'Resolve link' analysis task on each FSAA System Scan job","00420680 needs to be linked.

We began receiving 'Invalid length parameter passed to the LEFT or SUBSTRING function. This statement has been terminated.' error on the 1. Resolve links analysis task on the FSAA System Scans job ever since we successfully got the 3. Nasuni analysis task on the FSAA Bulk Import job to succeed. We also ran their 0-FSDFS System Scans job for the first time before we started getting those errors.

Their SA_FSDFS_Links table contains the inserted entries from their Nasuni filers as well as some of the dfs namespaces found via the 0-FSDFS System Scans job.
- For the Nasuni entries there are unique rows for each of them each with their own unique HOST, ID, and NamespaceID. The NamespaceName and DfsPath for each of the Nasuni entries is in this format '\NASUNIFILERFQDN$'. The Nasuni entries each have the same DfsResourceID and their DfsHostID is different and matching the HOST column values. Each of the Nasuni entries has '\DEDICATEDNASUNIEDGEAPPLIANCEFQDN' in the TargetPath column. None of the Nasuni entries have any values for the TargetHostID, TargetGateID, TargetResourceID, State, Timeout, and DfsGuid columns.
- For the non-Nasuni dfs namespace entries, they seem mostly normal except having null values for the DfsResourceID, DfsHostID, TargetHostID, TargetGateID, and TargetResourceID columns.

I do believe they were receiving a number of errors scanning the identified dfs hosts using the scoped dfs scans with FSAA due to not having permissions setup for our scan account to those servers. I'm not sure if the fact we are scanning those properly might be causing issues, or with how we insert the Nasuni filer entries into the dfs tables with the 3. Nasuni analysis task being the problem. I've attached the screenshot of the data we could see from that table to the ticket.

Seems like dev is planning to take this on to be reviewed on upcoming sprint (2/19).","Step 1: Run the ""0-FSDFS System Scans"" job on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) platform.  
Step 2: Run the ""3. Nasuni analysis task"" on the FSAA Bulk Import job.  
Step 3: Run the ""1. Resolve links analysis task"" on the FSAA System Scans job.  
Step 4: Observe the error message: ""Invalid length parameter passed to the LEFT or SUBSTRING function. This statement has been terminated.""  

Note: Ensure that the SA_FSDFS_Links table contains entries from Nasuni filers and DFS namespaces, as described in the ticket.

(Requested by Rejaul Uddin)","Update 11.6.0.139 has been applied
Reviewing the Nasuni FSAA scan job, I don't see the 
""Invalid length parameter passed to the LEFT or SUBSTRING function.  The statement has been terminated.""

error

There are however lots of other FSAA errors:
""Path not found scanning:...""
""Error Expanding Folder...""
""Error Enumerating TFolderEnumerator: Unable to perform folder scan for...""
""Error getting Security desciptor for sahre, dafaulting to ""Everyone/FullControll""

That last one likely explains why most shares in AIC show everyone permission on most shares","The plan moving forward is to close ticket 00435774 because the issue with the resolve links seems to have been resolved with the hotfix. We will continue to address the other issue with the other tickets.","hot fix seems to have fixed the resolve links issue
plan moving forward is to close this ticket and address other issues on other tickets

Next Steps Updated: Dean Bardowell will:
1. confirm if the FSAA Resolve Links analysis task error persists after the update and provide details once the current scans are completed.
2. spot-check the accuracy of share permissions listed in the Access Information Center to verify if the permissions are being reported correctly.

Joshua Sexton will:
1. schedule a remote session with Dean Bardowell to review the status of the FSAA scans and other related tickets.
2. research supported Nasuni versions to ensure compatibility and provide additional details.
3. close this ticket (00435774) and continue addressing related issues through other tickets.
4. review the DEBUG logs from Netwrix Activity Monitor to investigate the overloaded Proxy Service.
5. partner with Devon Anderson to gain better context for the implementation and identify potential improvements.
6. determine the best course of action to reduce Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's drive space usage, likely by removing unnecessary data from previous Nasuni Activity Collection deployments.
7. research ways to configure the Nasuni Proxy Service's performance to address the overburdened service issue.","Product defect","Joshua Sexton","Error","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","NEA for Nasuni","Reports","11.5","11.5.0.269","102.9","Closed - Resolved","Crestron Electronics","Dean Bardowell","2025-02-13T16:10:35.000Z","2025-05-27T13:58:09.000Z"
