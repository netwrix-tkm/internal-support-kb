@Salesforce @Helen Randall - no updates for the customer yet on this one. We weren't able to pull the investigation onto this sprint but it's near the top of the backlog to hopefully be pulled onto the sprint starting 3/5.

@Salesforce Yes, there is a fix on the way. It's a matter of working out an internal issue, getting it into a hotfix. So we are getting that resolved ASAP, and we will update with a build/hotfix once available.
