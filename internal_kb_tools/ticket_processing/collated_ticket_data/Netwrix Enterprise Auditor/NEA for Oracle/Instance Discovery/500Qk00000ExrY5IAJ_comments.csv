"00aQk000008m2vlIAA","500Qk00000ExrY5IAJ","Today we reviewed the logs for the Oracle .InstanceDiscovery job and identified a username/password logon denied permissions for the container hosting the pluggable database. We also discovered that the container does not have a user credential created for it and therefore could possibly be causing the permissions error for the Oracle .InstanceDiscovery job. 

We recommend creating a user account for the container hosting the pluggable database and verifying that the connection profile used to run the job has the below permissions: 

CONTAINER_DATA=ALL FOR %NAME_OF_PLUGGABLE_DATABASE% CONTAINER = CURRENT;

Once a credential has been created for the container and the above permission has been applied to the credential at the root of the container please run the .InstanceDiscovery scan again","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-08-27T22:47:25.000Z","2024-08-27T22:47:25.000Z","false","false"
