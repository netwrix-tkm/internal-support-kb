"500Qk00000LlYQQIA3","00435503","Support Ticket","Oracle database scanning","Hello,

In the next few days I will be starting work with a customer (WIS International) who will be doing some Oracle database scans.  It's been a very long time since I set that up and I remember it being quite a challenge.  I'd like to identify someone from support with a good deal of expertise on setting up and scanning Oracle with NEA.  I'm hoping to coordinate some time early next week with the customer, their DBA(s?), and the Netwrix tech person to make sure we set it up properly.","","We are unable to establish the connection from the NEA server to the Solaris server","We will review to ensure everything is working.","We edited the connection profile for the Oracle service account by switching Oracle Roll from Sysdba to Default.","Guidance","Frantz Baptiste","Question","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","NEA for Oracle","Configuration","11.6","","37.7","Closed - Resolved","WIS International","robert parsons","2025-02-11T20:59:32.000Z","2025-03-21T13:58:38.000Z"
