Hello Al,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00436348. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00436348
Ticket Subject: Improved Expand Effective Membership analysis task on SG_LocalAdmins to retain previous successful collection of each host
Ticket Details: A custom had mentioned on a project that they would occasionally get RPC errors here and there on some hosts (they are scanning 1000 hosts at least daily but usually more than once a day), and the SA_SG_LocalAdmins_Details table would drop the hosts completely for any that had issues on the most recent collection. This meant we had to wait for it to run again (and hopefully succeed the next time) which it usually would and pull in the same data we had already collected before. I've changed the analysis task on the job to better handle this and retain the previous successful host audit even if it were to fail for one of them on a recent run it would still show the most recent successful info we have for that host. I think this would be a good addition/change to the existing job in the product. I've attached the job from my lab (I've left the previous out-the-box analysis there unchecked and labeled it as old.

Thank you!
