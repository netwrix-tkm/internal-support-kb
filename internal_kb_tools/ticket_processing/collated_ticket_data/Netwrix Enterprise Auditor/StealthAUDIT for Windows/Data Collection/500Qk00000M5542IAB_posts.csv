This meant we had to wait for it to run again (and hopefully succeed the next time) which it usually would and pull in the same data we had already collected before. I've changed the analysis task on the job to better handle this and retain the previous successful host audit even if it were to fail for one of them on a recent run it would still show the most recent successful info we have for that host. I think this would be a good addition/change to the existing job in the product. I've attached the job from my lab (I've left the previous out-the-box analysis there unchecked and labeled it as old.","","","","0050g000006QqyEAAS","2025-02-19T19:24:14.000Z"

2. Receive successful collection on hosts
- SA_SG_LocalAdmins_Details table shows all information collected for each host
3. Run SG_LocalAdmins to check if there were any changes to group membership
4. Receive an error on some of the hosts with connecting for that run
- SA_SG_LocalAdmins_Details table only shows information on hosts that were successful and drops all other host data","","","","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2025-03-10T20:35:56.000Z"
