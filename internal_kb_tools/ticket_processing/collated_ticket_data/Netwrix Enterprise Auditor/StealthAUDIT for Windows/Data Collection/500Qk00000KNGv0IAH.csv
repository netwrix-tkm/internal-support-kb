1) It looks like you are licensed for the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Windows Solution which should contain a job that can help you identify where IS Local Administrators in a member of the local admins group.

2) In the NEA Console, expand the following: Windows > Privileged Accounts > SG_LocalAdmins
