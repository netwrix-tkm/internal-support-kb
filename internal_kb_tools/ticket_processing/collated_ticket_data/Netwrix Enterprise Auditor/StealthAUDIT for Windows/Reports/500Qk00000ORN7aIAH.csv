Resolution
We found that the problematic job was nested inside many directories/job groups in Netwrix Access Analyzer. Owing to the Windows Server native limitation, the report was not getting generated. To resolve this issue, we moved out the job Folder to 2-3 directories above in the hierarchy and it resolved the issue.","Incorrect Configuration - Netwrix Product/System","Saqib Sharif","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows","Reports","11.6","11.6.0.42","11.7","Closed - Resolved","Shell Information Technology International, Inc.","Mahima Bopche","2025-04-25T06:48:54.000Z","2025-05-07T00:37:24.000Z"
