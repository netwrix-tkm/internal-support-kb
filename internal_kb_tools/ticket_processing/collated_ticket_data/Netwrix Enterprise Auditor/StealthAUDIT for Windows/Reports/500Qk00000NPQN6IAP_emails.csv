Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help. Just to make sure I'm understanding your issue, Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's Window's solution is still reporting disabled admin accounts as active, and the latest scan on those servers is reportedly from 03/19.

The Windows solution is comprised of a number of smaller collectors that gather different components of targeted Windows Servers. It sounds like one or more of those scans is failing to run regularly.

I'd think it's best to review over a remote session. Please use the following link to schedule at your convenience:

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we investigated Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA)'s Local Admins scan job and report. We found that users who have been removed from the local admin groups are still showing in the reports. The database tables correctly indicate that the users haven't been reporting in that group for some time but are not automatically removing the users from the group.

Like we discussed, I'm going to do some research and test on this. I will let you know as soon as I have next steps. Thank you for your patience.

I'm sorry for the delay. I've done some research and tested in my lab. The job in my lab is working as expected; users who are removed from the local admin groups are no longer showing on the local admins report or the SG_LocalAdmins_Details table.

I was discussing this with T2 Engineer, Tay. She has some insight into your deployment, and she thinks it has to do with modifications that were made to your job. Tay already has a meeting scheduled with you later today and said she will take a look during that meeting.

Thank you,

Hey Alan,

Parsing through the logs for the Local Admins job, and it looks like we're not in debug. Can you please increase the log level for the job and rerun it? Then upload the new logs to the ticket.

To adjust the log level, you'll need to access the General tab of the Job Properties: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Jobs/Job/Properties/Overview.htm

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

	Renamed the SG_LocalAdmins_Details table to have _old at the end
	Ran a successful scan to recreate the _Details table with one smaller host
	Re-set the job to use all Windows hosts

The next report you get should be clean and accurate for all the hosts we're able to connect and collect from. Once the job completes, please use the link below to schedule another remote session where we can investigate what hosts are failing, and why:

Thank you for meeting with me today. We confirmed the SG_LocalAdmins report is looking good and as expecting with the exception of 4 erroring hosts. 1 is failing due to a blocked protocol and the other 3 do not have a valid credential in the connection profile. The protocols and permissions required for the job can be found here in our documentation:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/UsersGroups/Overview.htm

As we discussed, I will proceed with closing this ticket out while you work with your team to get the proper permissions and protocols in place. If there are any issues after that, this ticket can be re-opened within 30 days.
