"500Qk00000NPQN6IAP","00440251","Support Ticket","SG_LocalAdmins job not reflecting changes for deleted/disabled users","SG_LocalAdmins scan is not picking up changes for some users we identified were disabled and are still showing as active on the SA_SG_LocalAdmins_Details table.
Even if we reduce the scan's scope to just a few servers those users were on, the scan keeps showing ""2025-03-19 06:00:00"" as the Date Audited with stale data. 
Please Advise","1. Run LocalAdmins job
2. Observe more than 1 audit date in the _Details table","The workflow has been customized by ProServ.

I renamed the old _details table to preserve the old data while we troubleshoot. Then we ran the job against one of the smaller hosts to successfully rebuild the _Details table.

Now we've configure the job to run against all the windows hosts again to narrow down which hosts are having issues currently, who is no longer active, etc.","Wait for the job to complete and have a follow-up meeting to correct host errors (where are we missing perms and ports?)","Several erroring hosts caused the scan to become cluttered with extra data/audit dates (only successes are updated). We cleared the _details tables and rebuilt it, then verified the current 4 hosts with issues. Permissions and protocols sent to customer to have his system admins adjust.","Incorrect configuration: target server software","Tay Caliguiri","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Windows","Reports","11.6","138","15.0","Closed - Resolved","Axos Bank","Alan A.
