Even if we reduce the scan's scope to just a few servers those users were on, the scan keeps showing ""2025-03-19 06:00:00"" as the Date Audited with stale data.

I renamed the old _details table to preserve the old data while we troubleshoot. Then we ran the job against one of the smaller hosts to successfully rebuild the _Details table.

Now we've configure the job to run against all the windows hosts again to narrow down which hosts are having issues currently, who is no longer active, etc.","","","","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2025-04-10T20:27:58.000Z"
