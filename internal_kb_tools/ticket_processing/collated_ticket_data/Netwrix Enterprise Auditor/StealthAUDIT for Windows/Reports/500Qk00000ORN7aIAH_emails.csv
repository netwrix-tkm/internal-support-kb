Thank you for taking the time to meet today. It was a pleasure working with you.

Today we:
troubleshooted and resolved the issue related to reports not getting generated. The error in logs was:
 

The specified path, file name, or both are too long. The fully qualified file name must be less than 260 characters, and the directory name must be less than 248 characters.

To resolve this issue, initially, we tried to increase the Max Path limit of Windows by setting the value of following key to 1:
 

ComputerHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystemLongPathsEnabled

We rebooted the server, but it didn't resolve the issue. We observed that the reports job under investigation was nested in so many folders/directories. We copied that job and pasted it a few directories above in jobs folder/directory hierarchy. Afterwards, we ran the job, and it ran without any errors, and we were able to see the report and download a CSV out of it.

It was also discussed that Max Path limit is set by Windows itself unlike Linux OS. I am sharing a reference link to that:

Maximum Path Length Limitation - Win32 apps | Microsoft Learn

Our next steps are:
You will:
check and discuss this solution with your team internally.

I will:
follow up with you on Friday to see if you require any assistance or if I am good to close this case.

Have a great day!

Hi Mahima,

I was going through logs and found this entry:

Can you please check the Local Administrators report and identify if the Report title or storage contains more than 260 characters for file name and directory path more than 248 characters?

Have a great day!
