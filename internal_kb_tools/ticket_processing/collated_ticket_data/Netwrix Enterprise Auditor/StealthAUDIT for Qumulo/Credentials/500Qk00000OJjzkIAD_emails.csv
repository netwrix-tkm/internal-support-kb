On the call today, 22-April-2025, we at least resolved the issue of the correct permissions for the account collecting from Qumulo endpoint(s).

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved.
The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

1) Specifically, for Qumulo the issue that we found today, see the article, it looks as though the following permission was not granted to the collection account = ""Group membership in the Data-Administrators role"". The permission had to be granted on both nodes (or are they separate servers).

2) Now the scan is working.

Access & Sensitive Data Auditing Permissions
The credentials used by the Access Analyzer scans must have the following permissions on the target host:

Group membership in the Data-Administrators role

NOTE: These permissions are in addition to those needed to either deploy applet scans for running scans in proxy mode with applet or installing the File System Proxy Service Permissions for running scans in proxy mode as a service. See the File System Scan Options topic for additional information.

Thank you,
