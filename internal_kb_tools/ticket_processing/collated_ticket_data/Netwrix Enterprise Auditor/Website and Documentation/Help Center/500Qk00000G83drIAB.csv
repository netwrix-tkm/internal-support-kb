We got asked by a possible client, if it's possible, to elaborate a kind of battle card with indications of what NEA can do over Varonis, mainly on users permissions on File System.

The question was: ""Varonis have the functionality to change permissions of monitored users, can NEA do the same?""

If you can send me some documentation, if possible, that shows some details on this subject, it would be great

Thank you!","","","","Account Manager was able to provide the customer with a battle card comparing Varonis and NEA","Guidance","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","Website and Documentation","Help Center","11.6","","4.1","Closed - Resolved","AIQON Servicos em Informatica LTDA - MSP","Rafael Zacarias","2024-09-23T12:40:51.000Z","2024-09-27T14:07:56.000Z"
