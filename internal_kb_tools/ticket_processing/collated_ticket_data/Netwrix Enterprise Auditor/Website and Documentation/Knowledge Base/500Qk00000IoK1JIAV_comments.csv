@Ethan Israel @Michael Burrofato @Somya Bhargava @Helen Randall @WaitingOnEngineer

I don't see any error related to the above issue in the webserver logs so it must come from the Tomcat server. Can we have Tomcat logs too, please? The tomcat logs can be found here 

STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITActionsSurveyTomcatlogs

Also, the customer can try the following things: 

	 - 	Clear the browser cookies and cache and access the survey
	 - 	Increase the value of ""maxHttpHeaderSize"" in the STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITActionsSurveyTomcatconfserver.xml
add maxHttpHeaderSize attribute to the connector:




    <Connector port=""8080"" protocol=""HTTP/1.1""
               maxHttpHeaderSize=""65536""
               .......... />

When did the user get the ""bad request - request too long"" response - right after loading the survey or after moving to the next question? if the user is getting a bad request response after submitting the answer then can I have a screenshot of the question,-answer, please?

I don't see any survey debug statements in the webserver log files. I verified that the customer is running the correct version of the webmodule (WebWebModules.dll 11.6.135).

The user can access the portal, after changing the registry key. 
It looks like IIS/some Windows service is still used as the authentication/authorization, before passing it to Apache.

Can Dev confirm how Windows Authentication works for SSO on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor portal, because we thought it no longer uses IIS? 


Snippet of Microsoft guide we followed below:
For IIS 6.0 and later, the MaxFieldLength and MaxRequestBytes registry keys are located at the following sub key:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESystemCurrentControlSetServicesHTTPParameters
Set the key values as shown in the following table:
Name	Value Type	Value Data
MaxFieldLength	DWORD	(4/3 * T bytes) + 200
MaxRequestBytes	DWORD	(4/3 * T bytes) + 200
You can also set the registry keys to their maximum values, as shown in the next table. Consider all potential security ramifications before you make any changes to the registry settings.
Name	Value Type	Value Data
MaxFieldLength	DWORD	65536 (Dec) or 10000 (Hex)

The suggested registry key is for the HTTP.sys kernel-mode driver that handles all HTTP requests on the server and can be modified. 

The webserver was never hosted on IIS but it's a self-hosted webserver.
