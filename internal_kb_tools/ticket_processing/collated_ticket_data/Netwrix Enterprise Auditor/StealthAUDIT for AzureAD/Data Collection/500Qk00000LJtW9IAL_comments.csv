@Salesforce @Ethan Israel  @Helen Randall @Michael Burrofato @WaitingOnEngineer Here are  two theories worth investigating:
1) The EGMCalc.exe Process that it initialized during the scan runtime wasn't closed properly, for whatever reason, from their previous runs causing the error. I see the log attempts to run the egmcalc.exe process but instead of being successful it presents us with an error. I recommend checking to see if there is a rogue emgcalc.exe process running on the server. May also be worth giving the server a reboot at this point to see if that resolves the problem opening the exe. If it fails again, a new log would be useful.
2) There is some third party application blocking the egmcalc.exe process from initiating causing an unsuccessful connection. The typical path for the exe is ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITPrivateAssembliesStealthbits.StealthAUDIT.EgmCalc.exe"". Ask the customer if there is some third party application that could be possibly blocking the egmcalc.exe and whether it needs to be added to the exclusions list. It is not out of the ordinary for 3rd party applications to block unknown executibles from running, albeit this isn't the first time the scan has ran.

For added context, the EgmCalc.exe process runs near the end of the ADI and AADI scans and calculates the effective group membership of all users/groups found during the scan and the calculation is performed in the server itself instead of the SQL server. These would be the first two areas i recommend investigating these theories while we wait for this go to through the regular development cycle.

@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer  Dev reviewed the logs and it appears the connection to the database is being lost during the scan. The ExecuteScalar issue is a result of the connection loss from the NEA server to the database.

Customer and Proserv engineer both believe its was a timing issue with a backup causing performance issues.
