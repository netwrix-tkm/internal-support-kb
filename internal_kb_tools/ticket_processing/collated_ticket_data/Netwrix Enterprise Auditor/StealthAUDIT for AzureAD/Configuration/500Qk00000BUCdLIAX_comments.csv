Hi Allison,

See the additional explanation below:

We leverage two sets of permissions due to the fact that Microsoft Graph API provides us with some information, while we leverage other APIs to get additional information. This is why we see two sets of permission requirements for Sites.Read.All and Groups.Read.All. 

Sites.FullControll.All - This permission is used to query for the list of all site collections. We have tested with lower privileges and raised queries with Microsoft to confirm that this permission is required in order to enumerate site collections and child objects. 

Let me know if you have any additional questions. 

Thanks,
Farrah Gamboa
