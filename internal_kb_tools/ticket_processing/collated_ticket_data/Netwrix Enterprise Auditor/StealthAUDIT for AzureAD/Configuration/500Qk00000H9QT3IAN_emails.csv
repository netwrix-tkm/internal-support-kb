In today's meeting, I researched the groups in the ADInventoy_GroupView and did not find any of them.
I advised you to check your Active Directory; when you checked, you did not see any.
I changed the Query for ADI to run a full scan. After the scan, you can go to AIC and look for the groups again to see if they still appear.

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, We discovered that the groups you were looking for were nested under Azure AD Inventory.
We found them, and they're active, not deleted. We also discovered that the Azure AD Inventory job was not set up as it should.
We assigned the host to the job and the connection profile and ran a full scan.
 
After the Azure AD Inventory Scan is completed, you will run the  Azure AD Scan.
After the scan, you will check it to see if the users you mention are still part of these groups.
 
Please reply to this email to provide an update.

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we verified that the Azure AD Inventory job ran successfully, and we also ran the Azure AD job.
We reviewed the results from those groups under the AzureADInventoy_GroupMembersView and noticed that removed users no longer show in the list. We verified from the AIC, and those users were not listed.
We are closing this ticket as solved.
