This case is for my customer The Fresh Market.  In the Access Information Center, we noticed the Object Permissions report shows a user having ""full control"" of Domain Admins via direct permission.  We were obviously alarmed by this and did some digging to try to understand why it would say this, but we could not see why.  Our ADUC does NOT show the user to have that permission.  Please help me to understand what is going on here.  I will attach two screenshots that should help illustrate the confusion.","","","","The customer was not able to finish the feature request form and requested to close the ticket.","Guidance","Scottie Taylor","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","NEA Web Report Console","11.6","","10.0","Closed - Resolved","Optiv","robert parsons","2024-08-16T19:42:19.000Z","2024-08-26T20:33:46.000Z"
