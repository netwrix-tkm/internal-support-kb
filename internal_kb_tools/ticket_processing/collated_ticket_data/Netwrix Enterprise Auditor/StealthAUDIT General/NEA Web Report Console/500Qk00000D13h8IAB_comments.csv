**Current Issue**
Published reports is not accessible --getting Error Code: INET_E_DOWNLOAD_FAILURE in browser

**Troubleshooting Completed during Meeting**
- Not accessible locally or remotely
- AIC is working
- SQL db is not overloaded
- No certificate errors
- Restarted the service
- Verified the configuration
- Tried with FireFox
- Tried to look at longs but there are no errors (barely any logging)
- Stopped the running jobs (SPAA0.Collection OnPrem_2019, SPAA0. Collection Online, FSAA0.Collection_US) then ran a repair on the NEA console

**Logs/Screenshots Collected**
- WebServer Service logs
- WebServer Service config file

**Next Steps**
Brittany is able to access the reports she needs via the NEA Console at this time as a workaround. Will review with Team during Monday cadence meeting.","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2024-07-12T20:46:53.000Z","2024-07-12T21:01:17.000Z","false","false"
