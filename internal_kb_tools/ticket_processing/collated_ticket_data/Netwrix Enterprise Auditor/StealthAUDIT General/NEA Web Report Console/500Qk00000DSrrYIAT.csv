After updating cert using instructions provided in that ticket, I can no longer access the access tab at all.","","","","[Issue]
The ""Access"" tab on the Published Reports site returns a 500 error instead of taking us to the AIC.

[Root Cause]
In the WebServer.exe.config file, the value for AdditionalContentTabs was reset to default/missing.

[Resolution]
1. If both sites are secured, verify they are using the same certificate by comparing the thumbprint
2. Navigate to %SAInstallDir%Web and edit the WebServer.exe.config file using a notepad editor
3. On the AdditionalContentTabs line, change the value to  “Access, https://+:481/v2/login?embed”
4.
