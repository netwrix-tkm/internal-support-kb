The last successful update occurred on 4/19/2025, prior to the migration.
- The issue appears to be directly related to the migration process, as no updates have been recorded since the migration date.
- The root cause of the problem has not yet been identified, and further investigation is required to determine why the reporting system is failing to update.
- A meeting has been proposed to review the configuration file for the reporting site, which may provide insights into the issue.
