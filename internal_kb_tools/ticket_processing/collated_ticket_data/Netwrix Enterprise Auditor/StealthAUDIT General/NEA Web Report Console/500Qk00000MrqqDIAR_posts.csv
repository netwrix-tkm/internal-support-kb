Securing the Web Console

2) This morning, we added one of your AD accounts with a Report Viewer Role in SA/NEA > Settings> Access.  The second time we clicked the ""Save"" button and now your new Report Viewer user can view reports when they log into SA/NEA Published Reports.","","","","005Qk00000276ifIAA","2025-03-17T13:52:25.000Z"
