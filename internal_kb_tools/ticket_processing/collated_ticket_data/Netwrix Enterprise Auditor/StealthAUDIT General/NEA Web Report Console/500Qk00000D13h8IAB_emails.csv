Thanks for hopping on that call with me. To recap our session, we:

	Verified the Published Reports site is not accessible locally or remotely
	Saw there are no certificate errors
	Tried bot Firefox and Chrome 
	Looked at logs, but weren't getting much (No errors)
	Stopped the scans below and ran a repair on the NEA Console via Programs & Features
	
		SharePoint On-Prem - SPAA0.Collection OnPrem_2019
		SharePoint Online - SPAA0. Collection Online
		File System - FSAA0.Collection_US
	
	
	Verified the configuration file looked correct
	Reboot the NEA server


I got those files you uploaded so we can discuss the issue further with the Team on Monday, but let me know if there are any changes!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Thank you for meeting with us today. We successfully got the Published Reports back up. We aren't sure what caused the issue, but we ended up needing to rebind the certificate onto port 8082 and then we were good to go!

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,
