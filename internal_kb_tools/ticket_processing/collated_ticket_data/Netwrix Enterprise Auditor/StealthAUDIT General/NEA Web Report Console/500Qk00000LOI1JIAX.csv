We are facing issues in accessing the AIC console and getting IIS error. We tried restarting the IIS service but still he error is same.

Please help.","Have 11.5 with IIS and try to access the link","IIS in use, 11.5, suggested to check the prerequisites and upgrade
The customer wants 'a meeting to decide on an upgrade' - waste of time but nothing can be done

19.02.2025 

We started by checking the IIS configuration on the StealthAudit server and we noticed that there was an old binding for port 8443 configured for Default Web Site. 
We removed it because AIC has its own StealthAudit site in IIS and the binding was for an expired certificate. 

Then, we added a new certificate binding for port 8443 for StealthAudit AIC site using latest certificate. 
And finally, we updated ""WebServer.exe.config"" file within the Web folder of the StealthAUDIT installation directory using these values:
<add key=""AdditionalContentTabs"" value=""Access Information Center, https://+:/V2/Login?embed""/>
<add key=""BindingUrl"" value=""https://+:8443"">

This resolved the issue and we could access AIC over the FQDN of StealthAudit server using port 8443. We could access AIC page over https and certificate validation was successful.","Awaiting customer's choice on the path forward
Since I'm OOO this week, I'm sending a podlink.
Meeting plan:
1) Listen to Praveen's questions
2) Insist on the upgrade
3) (probably) perform the upgrade","We started by checking the IIS configuration on the StealthAudit server and we noticed that there was an old binding for port 8443 configured for Default Web Site.
