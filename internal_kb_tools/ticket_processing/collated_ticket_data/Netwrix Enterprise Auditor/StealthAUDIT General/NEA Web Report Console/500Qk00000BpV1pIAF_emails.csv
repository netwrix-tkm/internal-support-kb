Hello Jess, 

Sorry for the long reply. Could you please run the following command in cmd as an admin on the server where Netwrix Enterprise Auditor is installed:

Setspn â€“S HTTP/[FQDN] [domain][servername]$ 

Example from my enviroment:
Setspn â€“S HTTP/FILE.IKUD.LOCAL IKUDFILE$

And restart the following service after:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server

Please, try to log in to Published Reports - are you still being asked for credentials for Windows Authentication?

Thank you!

Hello Jess, 

Thanks for your time at today's meeting! We configured Windows Authentication for Published Reports and AIC but because of the 11.6 version issue - it is necessary to provide credentials for each login. I will check the workaround with my Team and we will configure it on Friday. Please, use the link below to schedule the meeting:

Hi Ilia,

Apologies for my delay in response back to you.
It has been an interesting week and I have been away from my computer for nearly 2 days ðŸ˜… This was due to a vendor summit meeting + a mentorship program so very nice, interesting week.

I tried to run the command and got an error:

Hi Ilia,

No problem at all! Hopefully you are feeling better now ðŸ˜Š
This is the error I get when pasting and running the script via elevated PS window:

[cid:image001.png@01DACD5D.049C84B0]

Of course I have had to blur out the server name (in the above case it is the FQDN listed).

I also tried just the server name without it being the FQDN and same error.
Additionally ran it line by line as well and same issue â˜¹

Hello Jess,

Thanks for the screenshot you provided! As I can see ""get-adcomputer"" is not recognized. Is it possible to try to run the script on the domain controller?

$targetname = ""file"" #Name of the computer you need to add the HTTP record to
$TRecord  = ""HTTP/""+(get-adcomputer $targetname ).DNSHostName + "" "" +  $env:USERDOMAIN+""""+$targetname+""""$"""""

How are things going? Could you please execute this PowerShell script on Domain Controller as an admin (It constructs an SPN (Service Principal Name) record in the format ""HTTP/<computer_name> <domain><targetname>$"" to register this and to provide Netwrix Published reports/AIC ability do not ask AD user credentials for Windows authentication for each login?  

$targetname = ""FILE"" #Name of the computer you need to add the HTTP record to
$TRecord  = ""HTTP/""+(get-adcomputer $targetname ).DNSHostName + "" "" +  $env:USERDOMAIN+""""+$targetname+""""$"""""
