Hi Ryan,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. Updating the SSL certificate for the AIC and Published Reports web console requires the certificate thumbprint of the new SSL cert and updating the certificate info within an admin command prompt. I have provided some helpful commands as well as documentation on this process below:

1) Command to display all SSL certificate info. You will want to copy and paste this info into a notepad - netsh http show sslcert

2) Command to delete the certificate and appID for each web console - netsh http del sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8082 to delete current cert

3) Command to add the SSL certificate info including assigning the SSL certificate to the application ID. You will want to modify the port number for the correct web application - netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8082 appid= certhash=
