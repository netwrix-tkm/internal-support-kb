--------
Customer confirmed that the scan came back ok after the last run, but they want to run one more scan on the 14th to double check.

IIS still had port 81 opened even though we are using port 481 HTTPS.
Disabled port 81 in IIS and awaiting security scan to confirm issue is resolved.","Awaiting customer security scan","Issue:
Security scans are detecting port 81 http is open when product has been configured for HTTPS

Cause:
Moving to HTTPS leaves port 81 open in IIS and needs to be disabled manually.

Resolution:
Disabled port 81 in IIS.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Ian Ranstrom","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","NEA Web Report Console","11.5","","8.9","Closed - Resolved","Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America","Mounica Devi Meka","2025-05-06T15:31:32.000Z","2025-05-15T14:16:28.000Z"
