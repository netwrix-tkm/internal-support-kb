Hi,

The desktop application works fine its just the web reporting interface that's down since the upgrade from 11.5 to 12.0

This means the only way we have to access reports is via the app on the server which is not ideal when multiple people need to access the reports at the same time.

I'm not sure how the rest of the questions relate to the issue we are having. However I have completed the questions from your response

Hi,

The desktop application works fine its just the web reporting interface that's down since the upgrade from 11.5 to 12.0

This means the only way we have to access reports is via the app on the server which is not ideal when multiple people need to access the reports at the same time.

I'm not sure how the rest of the questions relate to the issue we are having. However I have completed the questions from your response

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved. The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Symptom
The Web Service stopped working after the upgrade.

Cause
Local System was used instead of a dedicated user with DB access.

Resolution
After changing to a proper user the problem was resolved.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thanks Ilya, This was the fix. Was running as Local System this is what the installer creates the service as so might need to be part of the upgrade guide to check.

 

thanks for the prompt support.
