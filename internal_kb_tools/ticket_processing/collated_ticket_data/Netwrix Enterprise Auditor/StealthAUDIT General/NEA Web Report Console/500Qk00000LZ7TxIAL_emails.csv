Hello Mawloda,

I’m following up on my previous email with the scheduling availability link, as I haven’t seen a meeting scheduled yet.

If you need me to resend the link or if you have any questions, please feel free to reply to this email.

Looking forward to connecting with you!

Ticket Number: 00434944
Ticket Subject: Assistance with Creating AD Report in Netwrix
Ticket Details: Hi Support,

I’m reaching out because I’d like to create an Active Directory (AD) report that shows the Department and Company fields for all users in the Main Users OU. Ideally, I’d like the report to display the following information for each user:
•First Name
•Last Name
•Department
•Company
Could you please guide me on how to set this up in Netwrix? I’d love to learn how to generate this kind of report myself for future use.

Thank you so much,
Mawloda

Thank you!

Dusty Grayson
Sr. Support Engineer
