I believe Farah may already be tracking these efforts","","We recently put the CDSA through a thorough regression test and have seen some issues with it escalated or otherwise brought to PM's attention, so I wanted to provide a list of known, outstanding issues the NEA team are working through so folks are aware when presenting the CDSA to customers:

Slide	Issue Description	Azure DevOps Ticket #	SF Escalation Ticket #
6-Sensitive Data	""# resources contain sensitive data"" count is slightly off	355591
N/A
6-Sensitive Data	Counts for each platform in the ""RESOURCES WITH SENSITIVE DATA BY PLATFORM"" chart are inaccurate	359682
N/A
12-Shadow Access Rights	Under ""Exploitable Permissions"" the counts for Container, Full Control, and Reset Password are inaccurate. 	355462
N/A
12-Shadow Access Rights	In the Exploitable Permissions section ""contains"", ""domain compromise"" and ""member of"" will be removed as those are steps in the shadow access attack path rather than exploitable permissions	356345
N/A
5-Open Access	The percentage of resources that are openly accessible to users(in parentheses) is inaccurate	355609
N/A
Multiple	Resource counts (using the $Resources variable in the job script) are not properly including Oracle or SQLServer resources	355459
N/A
5-Open Access	Calculation for % of Resources with Open Access uses Site Collections for SharePoint but ""OPEN ACESS BY PLATFORM"" chart uses Sites, so they don't match. Both will be updated to use Site Collections	357474

The last ticket in the list is actively being worked on in the current sprint and the others are in the backlog to be pulled on and addressed once bandwidth allows.
