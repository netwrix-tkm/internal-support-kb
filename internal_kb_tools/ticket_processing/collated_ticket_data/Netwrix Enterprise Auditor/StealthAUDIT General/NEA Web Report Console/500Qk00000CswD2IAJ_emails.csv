I found this error in your logs. It means that there is an application actively listening on 8082 port already:

2024-07-11 23:39:04,918 ERROR - Inner Exception
2024-07-11 23:39:04,918 ERROR - System.Net.HttpListenerException (0x80004005): Failed to listen on prefix 'https://+:8082/' because it conflicts with an existing registration on the machine.

1. You would need to delete the prefix that uses 8082 port. Run this command in CMD on your NEA host below to retrieve all reserved URLs:

netsh http show urlacl
2. Then find what is using 8082 port. It may be http://+:8082, but may be different in your case. Once found please run this command below, changing the url to Reserved URL value of 8082:


netsh http delete urlacl url=<value of ""Reserved URL"" in the output of netsh http show urlacl>
You will get ""URL reservation successfully deleted"" output.

3. Run netsh http show sslcert and make sure the certificate is bound to 8082 port. You should see this in the output:



4. If you cannot find the bind to 8082 port then please follow this article:

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support.

Please check what account is running the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server service.
It might fall to ""Network Service"".

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server service should run either as a LOCAL SYSTEM or a service account with enough permissions to access the NEA SQL Server database.
