Mike,

Hi Lamare,

Did you see this part of the email that I sent to you back on March 3rd?
Do you need me to send another meeting invite?

2) To confirm users that should be able to access the NEA (or StealthAUDIT) Published Reports, open NEA (SA) and navigate to Settings > Access. Users must be configured at least with the role = ""Report Viewer"". Users configured with the Role = ""Administrator"" will be able to log into NEA Published Reports and view the reports.

Can you please test another user that you have configured there to see if they can access the NEA Published Reports?
(Note that when I use the ""DOMAINUSER"" User Name, I easily logged in with 3 of my configured accounts that I tested.)

I have inquired about the ""Account has no user principal name"" error.  Are you getting this error with multiple accounts or the account that you used today in our meeting?

1) In reviewing our Zoom Meeting recording from 03-March-2025, the same account that is used for the SA AIC (Access Information Center) service should be used for the SA Web Service Service (Log On As value).

I do not see that we changed this configuration during our meeting.

2) SA AIC - this probably works for you on your NEA server when you try to access it correct?
The SA Web Server service in Services.msc should be configured to use the same Windows Authentication account.

3) And then you should be able to access SA Published Reports using your own account (CORPVALA424971) as long as you are configured under SA > ""Settings"" > ""Access"" as I am pretty sure you were when we checked during our last meeting.

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved.
The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!
+++++
A) We followed the following KB today:
+++++

Unable to View Published Reports in Web Console
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000000Qs9KAE.html

B) After the customer logged into the NEA Published Reports successfully, they opened the "".Active Directory Inventory"" > ""Active Directory Summary"" report to obtain the same information that we obtained on the last call (03-March-2025) by opening SA (or NEA) and navigating to: NEA > Jobs > "".Active Directory Inventory"" > ""1-AD_Scan"" > Results > ""Active Direcotry Summary""

C) Reminder for when you may not have access to NEA Published Reports for any number of reasons, here is the way in SA/NEA to access the ""Active Direcotry Summary"" that the Netwrix Account and Renewals Managers need for NEA re-licensing purposes.

NEA > Jobs > "".Active Directory Inventory"" > ""1-AD_Scan"" > Results > ""Active Direcotry Summary""

+++++
+++++

1) In reviewing our Zoom Meeting recording from 03-March-2025, the same account that is used for the SA AIC (Access Information Center) service should be used for the SA Web Server Service (""Log On As"" value).

I do not see that we changed this configuration during our meeting.

2) SA AIC - I assume that this works for you on your NEA server when you try to access it.  The SA Web Server service in 'Services.msc' should be configured to use the same Windows Authentication account.

3) And then you should be able to access SA Published Reports using your own account (CORPVALA424971) if you are configured under SA > ""Settings"" > ""Access"" as I am confident you were when we checked during our last meeting.
