However, there seems to be a limitation as to how many rows are getting generated. I like to have a complete report on my file shares and like to know how this can be possible.  the job seems to be working, i just can see the data in its entirety.","","","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)   11.5.0.160

Looked at the Custom Report (FileSystem_Aging) that is looking at a table with 4.2+ million rows of data filtering on objects that are older than 84 months.

Adjusted the Export, Max Row limit, and Grid Filter options.

NOTE: Limits that are larger than the default may slow down the run time.
The reports cannot exceed 1 million rows as they will not be able to load.

Alternatively, we should be able to Run the Select portion of the Query with more restrictive WHERE clauses within SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Will utilize the Export from there to CSV.","Guidance","Dusty Grayson","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","NEA Web Report Console","11.5","160","28.7","Closed - Resolved","Horizon Media","Angelo DiPietro","2025-01-28T20:10:16.000Z","2025-02-26T13:30:26.000Z"
