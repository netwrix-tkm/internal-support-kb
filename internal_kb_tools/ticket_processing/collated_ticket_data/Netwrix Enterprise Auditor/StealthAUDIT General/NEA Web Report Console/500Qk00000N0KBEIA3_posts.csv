“Request for Downloading published reports Failed: Internal Server Error”
In the Web Service “Service.log” we see the error “The user name or password is incorrect.”
The username and or password is not incorrect as we are using it for a lot of other tasks. 
There is no RBA setup to the console or the reports. There are no certificates that have been assigned to the Published Reports Web Server. 
Access to the AIC is working fine. 
NEA Build number is 11.6.0.137

1) In my experience thus far (UPDATED on 2025_0336 @17:06 PM EST:

a) If I run the NEA Web Server using the Local System and I have NO Roles configured under NEA > Settings > Access, I can login using a Windows user and I CAN reach the NEA Published Reports page.

b) IF there are any roles configured in NEA under Settings > Access THEN a Windows NT user who does NOT at least have the NEA Role = Report Viewer, they can login but they will get the blue ""No Content"" message which says:

""No reports have been made available to you currently. Please contact your Administrator of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to provision access to published reports.""

Note:
a) I have removed ALL users from NEA > Settings > Access (no one has any roles).
b) NEA > Settings > Connection is using the NetwrixEA profile - SQL Server Auth only.
c) NEA > Settings > Storage > the NetwrixEA DB user that I created with SQL Server Auth only.
