@Michael Burrofato @Adam Pawson-Powell @Carlos Mejia @WaitingOnEngineer

Carlos sent me the log files outside this ticket and noticed a couple of errors with an invalid profile name or a missing global options.xml file. Also, they got the service working on 3/27, but they started getting invalid object name error on 4/3, so I am guessing they have changed the default storage profile in the meantime. 

I would make sure the storage profile is configured properly in the NEA.
Restart the webserver service, which should use the default storage profile and create the necessary tables. 

If it is still an issue, please provide the updated logs from ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSADatabaseLogsWeb"" folder.

@Carlos Mejia @Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer Comment from PM:

""Restarting the service had no impact on the problem. We saw the service go through a ""restart"" during the session but when reviewing the logs, no restarting of the service was recorded. Reboot failed to fix the problem so we went with reinstalling NEA as the next step. Web console is now running without issue post reinstall. This can be closed out.""


Closing this out on our end.
