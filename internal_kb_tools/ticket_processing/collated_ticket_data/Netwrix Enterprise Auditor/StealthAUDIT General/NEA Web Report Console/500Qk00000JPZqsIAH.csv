Username PCDAAIDMR01 created to reset and maintain user access.

Please advise if need recreate username or we just can reset password to solve the issue.","1. Create a local user.
2. Add user to Local Administrators group.
3. Try logging to Web console of NTM and NEA Reports module.","We were unable to access the server due to internal connectivity issues and cyberark problems. took around 35 minutes of TS and still werent able to get access.

Today (10/01/2025) discussed about access issue on StealthAUDIT server. A member of IDM team joined the call and shared an opinion about testing internally first.

(13/01/2025) In today's meeting, it was explained to the customer they need to provision an AD user account to get access to reporting module. Adding a local user account to administrators inside the LUSRMGR.MSC is not going to work. They will raise a change request internally","I will follow up with customer on 16/01/2025","Symptom
When you were trying to use local user accountÂ PCDAAIDMR01 to login to StealthAUDIT Reporting Module and StealthDefend, you were getting incorrect username/password error.

Resolution
By design, local accounts cannot login to mentioned web portals. An Active Directory user is authorized to login if a required role is assigned to it. You will be creating an AD account and then verify the functionality.","Incorrect configuration: target server software","Saqib Sharif","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","NEA Web Report Console","11.0","11.0.1221.1018","34.7","Closed - Resolved","Great Eastern Life Assurance (Malaysia) Berhad","MOHD HASBUL HAFIZ MAT HASSAN","2024-12-12T10:06:39.000Z","2025-01-16T03:06:03.000Z"
