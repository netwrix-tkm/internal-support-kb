1) One thing that we did not fix was the URL in the ""Publish Reports"" desktop icon in your environment.  You want it to point to the correct Published Reports link as found in your NEA > Settings > Reporting > Website URL configuration.  Please see the following Netwrix Help Center document and scroll down to the section = ""Update Website URLs"":
Securing the Web Console

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm#_Update_Website_URLs
2) This morning we added one of your AD account with a Report Viewer Role in SA/NEA > Settings> Access.  The second time we clicked the ""Save"" button and now your new Report Viewer user can view reports when they log into SA/NEA Published Reports.

Let me know if you have any other questions.
