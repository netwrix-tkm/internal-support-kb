After re-binding the certificate to 8082 I've checked the listening port list. Unfortunately, your 8082 port was not showing up, giving me the idea that it might be blocked by something in your environment.
I've suggested using a random high port instead, 45565, to which you've agreed.
After re-binding certificate to that port, there are no more issues with SSL and you can use https connection for the Web Console.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix server","Ilya Kotov","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","NEA Web Report Console","11.6","","5.9","Closed - Resolved","Fidelity Bank Nigeria","Antonie Olivier","2025-04-16T15:27:48.000Z","2025-04-22T14:12:29.000Z"
