Your fast support is highly appreciated","","","","I found this error in your logs. It means that there is an application actively listening on 8082 port already:

2024-07-11 23:39:04,918 ERROR - Inner Exception
2024-07-11 23:39:04,918 ERROR - System.Net.HttpListenerException (0x80004005): Failed to listen on prefix 'https://+:8082/' because it conflicts with an existing registration on the machine.

1. You would need to delete the prefix that uses 8082 port. Run this command in CMD on your NEA host below to retrieve all reserved URLs:

netsh http show urlacl

2. Then find what is using 8082 port. It may be http://+:8082, but may be different in your case. Once found please run this command below, changing the url to Reserved URL value of 8082:

netsh http delete urlacl url=<value of ""Reserved URL"" in the output of netsh http show urlacl>

You will get ""URL reservation successfully deleted"" output.

3. Run netsh http show sslcert command and ensure the certificate is bound to 8082 port.

4. If you cannot find the bind to 8082 port then please follow this article:
