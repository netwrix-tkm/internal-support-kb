 I have a vendor(Saviynt) that's looking to connect our Stealthaudit and they are asking about hostname and port that we can use to generate the access token.  I'm not exactly sure what they are asking for.","","","","Symptom:
Unable to pull data from the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) API

Cause:
The 3rd party tool was trying to use the Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) Port which does not support API calls

Resolution:
Confirmed that the rest API with the created Access was working, and limited it to the needed details via the following"" 

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Global Settings > Access > Web Service REST API for Applications Accessing Data Remotely >
Assign Application Access through the Web Service
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Access/RESTAPI/AssignAppAccess.htm

logged into SSMS to run the following to list our all the ShearPoint (SPAA) views

 SELECT
    SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name,
    name AS view_name
FROM
    sys.views
WHERE
    name LIKE '%SPAA%';
With the needed table/view names noted we tested the API call and noted we could pull the needed data via the following.
Clear-Host
$body = @{
  client_id=""****REDACTED***""
  client_secret=""****REDACTED***""
  grant_type=""client_credentials""
}
 
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -uri https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/token -Body $body -ContentType ""application/json""
$content = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
 
$access_token = $content.access_token;
#$access_token
$refresh_token = $content.refresh_token;
#$refresh_token

$headers = @{  
Authorization=""Bearer $access_token""
}
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -uri https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/data/SA_SPAA_DirectPermissionsView/rows -Headers $headers

Had the Cloud Utility correct to the needed port (8082).

Noted the ""RightsDescription"": ""RWD"",
Would be Read, Write, Delete.

Would look a the same objects within the Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) URL to confirm.
