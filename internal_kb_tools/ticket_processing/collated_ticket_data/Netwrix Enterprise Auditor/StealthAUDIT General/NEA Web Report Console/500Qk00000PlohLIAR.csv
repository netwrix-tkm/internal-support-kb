"500Qk00000PlohLIAR","00446679","Support Ticket","All Reports not updating after migration to new servers","All the reports in dev are not updating after migration.  
Last update time 4/19/2025
Migration date was:  4/25/2025","Step 1: Perform a migration of the reporting system to new servers.
Step 2: Verify the last update time of the reports in the development environment (expected to be 4/19/2025).
Step 3: Observe that no reports have updated since the migration date of 4/25/2025.","Reports in the development environment stopped updating after the migration to new servers on 4/25/2025. The last successful update occurred on 4/19/2025, prior to the migration.
- The issue appears to be directly related to the migration process, as no updates have been recorded since the migration date.
- The root cause of the problem has not yet been identified, and further investigation is required to determine why the reporting system is failing to update.
- A meeting has been proposed to review the configuration file for the reporting site, which may provide insights into the issue.","I will schedule a meeting with Bradley Dickinson to review the configuration file for the reporting site, as proposed in the email sent on 2025-05-30. This step is critical to identify potential issues in the configuration that may be causing the reports to stop updating.

2. The technical support team will investigate the root cause of the reporting system's failure to update after the migration, as further analysis is required to resolve the issue.","Issue: After migrating the reporting system to new servers on 4/25/2025, reports in the development environment stopped updating. The last successful update occurred on 4/19/2025, prior to the migration.

Cause: The issue was caused by a misconfiguration in the webserver. Specifically, the Report site was connecting to the wrong server due to a DNS issue. Additionally, the webserver's certificate binding needed to be corrected.

Resolution: The issue was resolved by performing the following steps:
1. Edited the webserver configuration to bind the correct certificate.
2. Restarted the webserver service.
3. Updated the DNS IP address to ensure the Report site connected to the correct server.

These actions restored the reporting system's functionality, allowing reports to update as expected.
