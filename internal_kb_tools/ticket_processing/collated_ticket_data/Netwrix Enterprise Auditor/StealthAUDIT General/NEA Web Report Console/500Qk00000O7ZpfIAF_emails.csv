Hi Ilya,
We have followed the steps on the article multiple times and as per the screenshot you can also see the binding is correct.

We’ve tried with a self-signed cert and also with their valid CA cert but still the same issue.

I made sure the binding is now correct and that they are using the correct thumbprint for binding.

I think a quick session with the customer would be ideal.

I’m on leave next week and will also be OOO until the 29th April.

If possible, if you can reach out to the customer next week when you are back I will really appreciate that. When I’m close to my PC next week I will also try and join the session.

The customer is Fidelity Bank and the contact is Hilary Ohakwe
Hilary.Ohakwe@fidelitybank.ng<mailto:Hilary.Ohakwe@fidelitybank.ng>

If that is okay with you I will send an introductory email to both you and the customer.

Kind Regards,
Antonie

Hi Ilya,
We have followed the steps on the article multiple times and as per the screenshot you can also see the binding is correct.

We’ve tried with a self-signed cert and also with their valid CA cert but still the same issue.

I made sure the binding is now correct and that they are using the correct thumbprint for binding.

I think a quick session with the customer would be ideal.

I’m on leave next week and will also be OOO until the 29th April.

If possible, if you can reach out to the customer next week when you are back I will really appreciate that. When I’m close to my PC next week I will also try and join the session.

The customer is Fidelity Bank and the contact is Hilary Ohakwe
Hilary.Ohakwe@fidelitybank.ng<mailto:Hilary.Ohakwe@fidelitybank.ng>

If that is okay with you I will send an introductory email to both you and the customer.

Kind Regards,
Antonie

Antonie,

Yes, I've seen the screenshots. It seems the issue with published reports specifically.

You might need to rebind the certificate to the port, please use the article above to do so. In case it's not working or if you need assistance - please let me know and we'll have a meeting.

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting I've checked your SSL settings and tested the connection.
After re-binding the certificate to 8082 I've checked the listening port list. Unfortunately, your 8082 port was not showing up, giving me the idea that it might be blocked by something in your environment.
I've suggested using a random high port instead, 45565, to which you've agreed.
After re-binding certificate to that port, there are no more issues with SSL and you can use https connection for the Web Console.

I'm going to close this ticket now, and if you'd like to leave some feedback - please complete a survey that will be sent to you afterwards. Any comments are appreciated!

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
