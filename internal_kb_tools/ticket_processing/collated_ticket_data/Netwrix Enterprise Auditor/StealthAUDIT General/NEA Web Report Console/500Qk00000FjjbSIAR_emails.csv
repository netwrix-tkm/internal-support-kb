Hi Cameron,

Has there been any change to the client ID or client secret? I am unable to connect to the StealthAudit server, which was working previously.

Hi All,



I have completed the table below.

For some context – Kerry does not utilize all 8 SharePoint permissions on a standard/newly created SharePoint site.

Instead it uses 3 that correlate with StealthAudit.



When a SharePoint site is created in Kerry, its get’s 3 levels of permission (see attached image)

  *   Site Owners – Full Control
  *   Site Members – Limited Control (Edit)
  *   Site Visitors – no control (Read)



StealthAudit has 3 permission options (see attached image)

  *   Full Control
  *   Modify
  *   Read only



Therefore as demonstrated in the table below, these 3 permissions with SharePoint vs StealthAudit correlate exactly.



Regards,

Lorcan

Hi Team,



To compare permissions between StealthAudit and SharePoint, we need to understand how StealthAudit permissions align with SharePoint permissions. In the StealthAudit report, changes are made manually in SharePoint based on the 'Desired Access.' We need clarity on what actions, such as read, write, delete, manage, or admin, should correspond to SharePoint permissions, as the permission structures differ.



Please map SharePoint permissions according to the StealthAudit permissions.

We should then be able to point the API to this view.

Looked at the other views as well.
SA_AIC_ResourceOwnersView
SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponseDetailsView
SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponsesView

SPAC did not have any data being that Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM) is not configured to collect these details.

Will need a case to set up the Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM) formally Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM) to collect details from SharePoint Online.

Hi Pinky,



2. We can use anything that matches between StealthAudit and Saviynt. Username/Account name might be better as this is unique, first name and last name may not be unique.



3. In the past I provided the output from the reviews and this identifies the reviewer (manager) and the users (employee), their current access and the desired access after the review so that Saviynt can change the correct permissions. If you need me to provide this again, please let me know. The review is complete based off the SharePoint site the user has access to and this data is stored in the StealthAudit tool.



Let me know if we need a call of these items.



Regards,

Lorcan

Hi Cameron,



Could you please help us retrieve the details mentioned in the email chain below?



1.Responses from the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables are not coming.



(We need to determine which of the following tables—SA_SPAA_DirectPermissionsView, SA_SPAA_ExceptionsView, SA_SPAA_PermissionsView, and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView—can be used to retrieve site permissions information. Your help in identifying the correct table(s) would be greatly appreciated)



2.@Lorcan<mailto:2.@Lorcan> O'Sullivan If StealthAudit does not provide email IDs, can we map user accounts using the format:

firstname.lastname (Saviynt) = MemberSamAccountName (StealthAudit)?



3.Is there a table that tracks changes (e.g., removal or modification of permissions), specifying who made the changes and on which profile in StealthAudit?

Pinky Chauhan

Hi Dusty,



Thankyou for your reply.



We are currently unable to retrieve results from the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables, and we are receiving the attached error. Could you please investigate? Additionally, the SA_SPAA_WebAppPoliciesView table is returning zero results.





Here is my response to the questions I previously raised:



1.Which table contains user details, such as user name, email ID, status, etc.?



In the SA_SPAA_LocalGroupMembersView table, we are able to retrieve user details, but it does not contain the user's email ID, which is needed for mapping to Saviynt users. We do have the MemberSamAccountName field, which holds values like firstname.lastname.



@Lorcan O'Sullivan<mailto:lorcan.osullivan@kerry.ie> If StealthAudit does not provide email IDs, can we map user accounts using the format:

firstname.lastname (Saviynt) = MemberSamAccountName (StealthAudit)?



2.Which table holds information about the owner who submitted the request in StealthAudit, and the details of the requestee?



Is there a table that tracks changes (e.g., removal or modification of permissions), specifying who made the changes and on which profile in StealthAudit?



3.Which table provides information on users' current access and permissions?



We will validate this once we are able to retrieve results from the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables.



4.What is the common identifier column between the user table and the access table?



We will validate this once we have the results from all the 9 tables.









Regards,

Pinky Chauhan

Pinky,

Thank You for the update.

Q1.Which table contains user details, such as User Name,Email ID,status etc?
A1 To best address this I would run the Query that list out the Views we selected on the last meeting.
SELECT
    SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name,
    name AS view_name
FROM
    sys.views
WHERE
    name LIKE '%SPAA%';

Then with the view names in hand we can run a query like the following:
SELECT TOP (50) * FROM SA_NEEDED_TABLE_NAME

This will give us a set of data to see if it meets the inquiry.

Q2.Which table holds information about the owner who submitted the request in StealthAudit and the details of the requestee?
A2.This seems like a Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) related question and the REST API is not supported for this URL (Port :481).
      Or I am not understanding the reference to the "" request""?  Please confirm.

Q3.Which table provides information on users' current access and permissions?
A3.We should be able to refer to A1.

Q4.What is the common identifier column between the user table and the access table?
A4. I'm not sure I fully understand this question, seems like this might also be AIC related. Please confirm.

Please let me know .

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,



Thankyou for adding me .



We were able to connect to the StealthAudit server, but to accomplish our use case for the StealthAudit and Saviynt integration, could you please assist us with the following information.



1.Which table contains user details, such as User Name,Email ID,status etc?

2.Which table holds information about the owner who submitted the request in StealthAudit and the details of the requestee?

3.Which table provides information on users' current access and permissions?

4.What is the common identifier column between the user table and the access table?



Additionally, I attempted to access the tables mentioned in the attached document, but they are not accessible.





Regards,

Pinky Chauhan

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the rest API via the following""
Clear-Host
$body = @{
  client_id=""****REDACTED***""
  client_secret=""****REDACTED***""
  grant_type=""client_credentials""
}

$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -uri https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/token<https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/token> -Body $body -ContentType ""application/json""
$content = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json

$access_token = $content.access_token;
#$access_token
$refresh_token = $content.refresh_token;
#$refresh_token

$headers = @{
Authorization=""Bearer $access_token""
}
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -uri https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/data/SA_SPAA_DirectPermissionsView/rows<https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/data/SA_SPAA_DirectPermissionsView/rows> -Headers $headers
$content = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json

$content

Will need to confirm with networking that the correct port is open to the needed Cloud Utility.
From the Cloud Utility network if we could get the result of the following might need to use FQDN for the -ComputerName
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName tsuk2dac01 -Port 8082

Please let me know if any additional assistance is needed for this case.

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA)    11.6.0.92<http://11.6.0.92>
NEA Access Information (AIC)         11.6.0.23<http://11.6.0.23>

Confirmed that the needed Client ID and secret for the API were in place.
When running the PowerShell test  we were able to see data in Json formatting.

When we edited the Access to limit to the SharePoint views now we are not able to re-query the API we get a 403 error.
This was because the query was looking for a view that was removed.

We then logged into SSMS to run the following to list our all the ShearPoint (SPAA) views

 SELECT
    SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name,
    name AS view_name
FROM
    sys.views
WHERE
    name LIKE '%SPAA%';

Noted a solution for this which worked with the affected customer and replicated in labs:
In addition to the documented steps, the following is required:

Using an account that has Domain admin permission to write to the domain controller the following command can be run:

username is the service account that runs the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web service.

Hello Team,



No problem, I’m here to provide any information that you need. Savyaint is trying to get the get the API from our Stealthbits for a SharePoint integration. I’ve provided the API through Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6 and it seems that they are having an issue getting the API. Here is a screenshot of what they are having an issue with.



[cid:image001.png@01DB26D8.00A8DE60]





I just want to know if I could get some assistance to see if it our side that’s having the issue or its something on their end that’s not working.



Best,



Cameron

Hi Cameron,

 

Has there been any change to the client ID or client secret? I am unable to connect to the StealthAudit server, which was working previously.

Hi All,

 

I have completed the table below.

For some context – Kerry does not utilize all 8 SharePoint permissions on a standard/newly created SharePoint site.

Instead it uses 3 that correlate with StealthAudit.

 

When a SharePoint site is created in Kerry, its get’s 3 levels of permission (see attached image)

Site Owners – Full ControlSite Members – Limited Control (Edit)Site Visitors – no control (Read)

 

StealthAudit has 3 permission options (see attached image)

Full ControlModifyRead only

 

Therefore as demonstrated in the table below, these 3 permissions with SharePoint vs StealthAudit correlate exactly.

 

Regards,

Lorcan

Hi Team,

 

To compare permissions between StealthAudit and SharePoint, we need to understand how StealthAudit permissions align with SharePoint permissions. In the StealthAudit report, changes are made manually in SharePoint based on the 'Desired Access.' We need clarity on what actions, such as read, write, delete, manage, or admin, should correspond to SharePoint permissions, as the permission structures differ.

 

Please map SharePoint permissions according to the StealthAudit permissions.

We should then be able to point the API to this view.

Looked at the other views as well.
SA_AIC_ResourceOwnersView
SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponseDetailsView
SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponsesView

SPAC did not have any data being that Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM) is not configured to collect these details.

Will need a case to set up the Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM) formally Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM) to collect details from SharePoint Online.

Hi Pinky,

 

2. We can use anything that matches between StealthAudit and Saviynt. Username/Account name might be better as this is unique, first name and last name may not be unique.

 

3. In the past I provided the output from the reviews and this identifies the reviewer (manager) and the users (employee), their current access and the desired access after the review so that Saviynt can change the correct permissions. If you need me to provide this again, please let me know. The review is complete based off the SharePoint site the user has access to and this data is stored in the StealthAudit tool.

 

Let me know if we need a call of these items.

 

Regards,

Lorcan

Hi Cameron,

 

Could you please help us retrieve the details mentioned in the email chain below?

 

1.Responses from the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables are not coming.

 

(We need to determine which of the following tables—SA_SPAA_DirectPermissionsView, SA_SPAA_ExceptionsView, SA_SPAA_PermissionsView, and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView—can be used to retrieve site permissions information. Your help in identifying the correct table(s) would be greatly appreciated)

 

2.@Lorcan O'Sullivan If StealthAudit does not provide email IDs, can we map user accounts using the format:

firstname.lastname (Saviynt) = MemberSamAccountName (StealthAudit)?

 

3.Is there a table that tracks changes (e.g., removal or modification of permissions), specifying who made the changes and on which profile in StealthAudit?

Pinky Chauhan

Hi Dusty,

 

Thankyou for your reply.

 

We are currently unable to retrieve results from the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables, and we are receiving the attached error. Could you please investigate? Additionally, the SA_SPAA_WebAppPoliciesView table is returning zero results.

 

 

Here is my response to the questions I previously raised:

 

1.Which table contains user details, such as user name, email ID, status, etc.?

 

In the SA_SPAA_LocalGroupMembersView table, we are able to retrieve user details, but it does not contain the user's email ID, which is needed for mapping to Saviynt users. We do have the MemberSamAccountName field, which holds values like firstname.lastname.

 

@Lorcan O'Sullivan If StealthAudit does not provide email IDs, can we map user accounts using the format:

firstname.lastname (Saviynt) = MemberSamAccountName (StealthAudit)?

 

2.Which table holds information about the owner who submitted the request in StealthAudit, and the details of the requestee?

 

Is there a table that tracks changes (e.g., removal or modification of permissions), specifying who made the changes and on which profile in StealthAudit?

 

3.Which table provides information on users' current access and permissions?

 

We will validate this once we are able to retrieve results from the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables.

 

4.What is the common identifier column between the user table and the access table?

 

We will validate this once we have the results from all the 9 tables.

 

 

 

 

Regards,

Pinky Chauhan

Pinky,

Thank You for the update.

Q1.Which table contains user details, such as User Name,Email ID,status etc?
A1 To best address this I would run the Query that list out the Views we selected on the last meeting.
SELECT
    SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name,
    name AS view_name
FROM
    sys.views
WHERE
    name LIKE '%SPAA%';

Then with the view names in hand we can run a query like the following:
SELECT TOP (50) * FROM SA_NEEDED_TABLE_NAME

This will give us a set of data to see if it meets the inquiry.

Q2.Which table holds information about the owner who submitted the request in StealthAudit and the details of the requestee?
A2.This seems like a Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) related question and the REST API is not supported for this URL (Port :481).
      Or I am not understanding the reference to the "" request""?  Please confirm.

Q3.Which table provides information on users' current access and permissions?
A3.We should be able to refer to A1.

Q4.What is the common identifier column between the user table and the access table?
A4. I'm not sure I fully understand this question, seems like this might also be AIC related. Please confirm.

Please let me know .

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,

 

Thankyou for adding me .

 

We were able to connect to the StealthAudit server, but to accomplish our use case for the StealthAudit and Saviynt integration, could you please assist us with the following information.

 

1.Which table contains user details, such as User Name,Email ID,status etc?

2.Which table holds information about the owner who submitted the request in StealthAudit and the details of the requestee?

3.Which table provides information on users' current access and permissions?

4.What is the common identifier column between the user table and the access table?

 

Additionally, I attempted to access the tables mentioned in the attached document, but they are not accessible.

 

 

Regards,

Pinky Chauhan

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the rest API via the following""
Clear-Host
$body = @{
  client_id=""****REDACTED***""
  client_secret=""****REDACTED***""
  grant_type=""client_credentials""
}
 
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -uri https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/token -Body $body -ContentType ""application/json""
$content = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
 
$access_token = $content.access_token;
#$access_token
$refresh_token = $content.refresh_token;
#$refresh_token

$headers = @{ 
Authorization=""Bearer $access_token""
}
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -uri https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/data/SA_SPAA_DirectPermissionsView/rows -Headers $headers
$content = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json

$content

Will need to confirm with networking that the correct port is open to the needed Cloud Utility.
From the Cloud Utility network if we could get the result of the following might need to use FQDN for the -ComputerName
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName tsuk2dac01 -Port 8082

Please let me know if any additional assistance is needed for this case.

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA)    11.6.0.92     
NEA Access Information (AIC)         11.6.0.23

Confirmed that the needed Client ID and secret for the API were in place.
When running the PowerShell test  we were able to see data in Json formatting.

When we edited the Access to limit to the SharePoint views now we are not able to re-query the API we get a 403 error.
This was because the query was looking for a view that was removed.

We then logged into SSMS to run the following to list our all the ShearPoint (SPAA) views

 SELECT
    SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name,
    name AS view_name
FROM
    sys.views
WHERE
    name LIKE '%SPAA%';

Referenced Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Data Collectors > SharePointAccess Data Collector > SPAA Drop Tables & Views Workflow
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/SPAA/DropTables.htm

Noted a solution for this which worked with the affected customer and replicated in labs:
In addition to the documented steps, the following is required:

Using an account that has Domain admin permission to write to the domain controller the following command can be run:
 
username is the service account that runs the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web service.
 
Setspn –S HTTP/NETBIOS_NAME_OF_NEA_SERVER domainusername
Setspn –S HTTP/FQDN_OF_NEA_SERVER domainusername

Hello Team,

 

No problem, I’m here to provide any information that you need. Savyaint is trying to get the get the API from our Stealthbits for a SharePoint integration. I’ve provided the API through Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6 and it seems that they are having an issue getting the API. Here is a screenshot of what they are having an issue with.

 

[Inline image name : image001.png]

 

 

I just want to know if I could get some assistance to see if it our side that’s having the issue or its something on their end that’s not working.

 

Best,

 

Cameron

Hi Cameron,

Could you please help validate the access expiration details as I can't validate these.

I can connect on the port but I'm unable to generate the access token.

Could you also check from your side if you're able to generate the access token using the same client ID and client secret.

Pinky Chauhan

Pinky,

What was the Access Role’s Access Expiration?

Access Expiration – The expiration for the client secret. Select an option for the desired access expiration:

Hi Cameron,

Has there been any change to the client ID or client secret? I am unable to connect to the StealthAudit server, which was working previously.

Hi All,



I have completed the table below.

For some context – Kerry does not utilize all 8 SharePoint permissions on a standard/newly created SharePoint site.

Instead it uses 3 that correlate with StealthAudit.



When a SharePoint site is created in Kerry, its get’s 3 levels of permission (see attached image)

  *   Site Owners – Full Control
  *   Site Members – Limited Control (Edit)
  *   Site Visitors – no control (Read)



StealthAudit has 3 permission options (see attached image)

  *   Full Control
  *   Modify
  *   Read only



Therefore as demonstrated in the table below, these 3 permissions with SharePoint vs StealthAudit correlate exactly.



Regards,

Lorcan

Hi Team,



To compare permissions between StealthAudit and SharePoint, we need to understand how StealthAudit permissions align with SharePoint permissions. In the StealthAudit report, changes are made manually in SharePoint based on the 'Desired Access.' We need clarity on what actions, such as read, write, delete, manage, or admin, should correspond to SharePoint permissions, as the permission structures differ.



Please map SharePoint permissions according to the StealthAudit permissions.

Hi Team,



Please find MOM of today's call.



Attendees:

•     cameron.bowlds@kerry.com

•     lorcan.osullivan@kerry.ie

•     Dusty Grayson

•     pinky.chauhan@kerry.com



Point of discussion:



1.Is there a table that tracks changes (e.g., removal or modification of permissions), specifying who made the changes and on which profile in StealthAudit?



Dusty was trying to build the query to get the relevant information.



2.Responses from the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables are not coming.



Using SQL query results are coming.



3.Which table contains user details, such as User Name,Email ID,status etc?



SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView can be refer.





ACTION ITEMS:



1.Cameron will provide the export of the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables for Pinky to apply filters in Postman, as results are only returned after filtering

2.Pinky will validate the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables results.

3.Cameron will raise ticket for the Stealth bits Activity monitor to be updated on the server to capture Sharepoint online data in SAM .







Regards,

Pinky Chauhan

We should then be able to point the API to this view.

Looked at the other views as well.
SA_AIC_ResourceOwnersView

SPAC did not have any data being that Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM) is not configured to collect these details.

Will need a case to set up the Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM) formally Stealthbits Activity Monitor (SAM) to collect details from SharePoint Online.

Hi Pinky,



2. We can use anything that matches between StealthAudit and Saviynt. Username/Account name might be better as this is unique, first name and last name may not be unique.



3. In the past I provided the output from the reviews and this identifies the reviewer (manager) and the users (employee), their current access and the desired access after the review so that Saviynt can change the correct permissions. If you need me to provide this again, please let me know. The review is complete based off the SharePoint site the user has access to and this data is stored in the StealthAudit tool.



Let me know if we need a call of these items.



Regards,

Lorcan

Hi Cameron,



Could you please help us retrieve the details mentioned in the email chain below?



1.Responses from the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables are not coming.



(We need to determine which of the following tables—SA_SPAA_DirectPermissionsView, SA_SPAA_ExceptionsView, SA_SPAA_PermissionsView, and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView—can be used to retrieve site permissions information. Your help in identifying the correct table(s) would be greatly appreciated)



2.@Lorcan<mailto:2.@Lorcan> O'Sullivan If StealthAudit does not provide email IDs, can we map user accounts using the format:

firstname.lastname (Saviynt) = MemberSamAccountName (StealthAudit)?



3.Is there a table that tracks changes (e.g., removal or modification of permissions), specifying who made the changes and on which profile in StealthAudit?









Regards,

Pinky Chauhan

Hi Dusty,



Thankyou for your reply.



We are currently unable to retrieve results from the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables, and we are receiving the attached error. Could you please investigate? Additionally, the SA_SPAA_WebAppPoliciesView table is returning zero results.





Here is my response to the questions I previously raised:



1.Which table contains user details, such as user name, email ID, status, etc.?



In the SA_SPAA_LocalGroupMembersView table, we are able to retrieve user details, but it does not contain the user's email ID, which is needed for mapping to Saviynt users. We do have the MemberSamAccountName field, which holds values like firstname.lastname.



@Lorcan O'Sullivan<mailto:lorcan.osullivan@kerry.ie> If StealthAudit does not provide email IDs, can we map user accounts using the format:

firstname.lastname (Saviynt) = MemberSamAccountName (StealthAudit)?



2.Which table holds information about the owner who submitted the request in StealthAudit, and the details of the requestee?



Is there a table that tracks changes (e.g., removal or modification of permissions), specifying who made the changes and on which profile in StealthAudit?



3.Which table provides information on users' current access and permissions?



We will validate this once we are able to retrieve results from the SA_SPAA_PermissionsView and SA_SPAA_EffectiveAccessView tables.



4.What is the common identifier column between the user table and the access table?



We will validate this once we have the results from all the 9 tables.









Regards,

Pinky Chauhan

Pinky,

Thank You for the update.

Q1.Which table contains user details, such as User Name,Email ID,status etc?
A1 To best address this I would run the Query that list out the Views we selected on the last meeting.
SELECT
    SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name,
    name AS view_name
FROM
    sys.views
WHERE
    name LIKE '%SPAA%';

Then with the view names in hand we can run a query like the following:
SELECT TOP (50) * FROM SA_NEEDED_TABLE_NAME

This will give us a set of data to see if it meets the inquiry.

Q2.Which table holds information about the owner who submitted the request in StealthAudit and the details of the requestee?
A2.This seems like a Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) related question and the REST API is not supported for this URL (Port :481).
      Or I am not understanding the reference to the "" request""?  Please confirm.

Q3.Which table provides information on users' current access and permissions?
A3.We should be able to refer to A1.

Q4.What is the common identifier column between the user table and the access table?
A4. I'm not sure I fully understand this question, seems like this might also be AIC related. Please confirm.

Please let me know .

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,



Thankyou for adding me .



We were able to connect to the StealthAudit server, but to accomplish our use case for the StealthAudit and Saviynt integration, could you please assist us with the following information.



1.Which table contains user details, such as User Name,Email ID,status etc?

2.Which table holds information about the owner who submitted the request in StealthAudit and the details of the requestee?

3.Which table provides information on users' current access and permissions?

4.What is the common identifier column between the user table and the access table?



Additionally, I attempted to access the tables mentioned in the attached document, but they are not accessible.

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the rest API via the following""
Clear-Host
$body = @{
  client_id=""****REDACTED***""
  client_secret=""****REDACTED***""
  grant_type=""client_credentials""
}

$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Method POST -uri https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/token<https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/token> -Body $body -ContentType ""application/json""
$content = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json

$access_token = $content.access_token;
#$access_token
$refresh_token = $content.refresh_token;
#$refresh_token

$headers = @{
Authorization=""Bearer $access_token""
}
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Method GET -uri https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/data/SA_SPAA_DirectPermissionsView/rows<https://TSUK2DAC01.ict.kerryad.com:8082/api/v1/data/SA_SPAA_DirectPermissionsView/rows> -Headers $headers
$content = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json

$content

Will need to confirm with networking that the correct port is open to the needed Cloud Utility.
From the Cloud Utility network if we could get the result of the following might need to use FQDN for the -ComputerName
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName tsuk2dac01 -Port 8082

Please let me know if any additional assistance is needed for this case.

Team,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA)    11.6.0.92<http://11.6.0.92>
NEA Access Information (AIC)         11.6.0.23<http://11.6.0.23>

Confirmed that the needed Client ID and secret for the API were in place.
When running the PowerShell test  we were able to see data in Json formatting.

When we edited the Access to limit to the SharePoint views now we are not able to re-query the API we get a 403 error.
This was because the query was looking for a view that was removed.

We then logged into SSMS to run the following to list our all the ShearPoint (SPAA) views

 SELECT
    SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id) AS schema_name,
    name AS view_name
FROM
    sys.views
WHERE
    name LIKE '%SPAA%';

Noted a solution for this which worked with the affected customer and replicated in labs:

Hello Team,



No problem, I’m here to provide any information that you need. Savyaint is trying to get the get the API from our Stealthbits for a SharePoint integration. I’ve provided the API through Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6 and it seems that they are having an issue getting the API. Here is a screenshot of what they are having an issue with.



[cid:35f11cef-b400-4e6c-b7ea-af5617e456e7@Image_2_]





I just want to know if I could get some assistance to see if it our side that’s having the issue or its something on their end that’s not working.



Best,



Cameron
