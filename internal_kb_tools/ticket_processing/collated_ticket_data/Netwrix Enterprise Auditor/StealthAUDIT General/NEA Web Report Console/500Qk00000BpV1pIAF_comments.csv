Reliably Repro'd in Customer Envi

Troubleshooting completed/Notes: 
During the meeting I tried the Workaround we have:
1. Setspn –S HTTP/NETBIOS_NAME_OF_NEA_SERVER domainusername
Setspn –S HTTP/FQDN_OF_NEA_SERVER domainusername

We tried FQDN, server name, service name for ""FQDN_OF_NEA_SERVER"" but every time we have the same error: 
""Unknown parametr HTTP/ops...-nea01.au.thalesgroup.local. Please, check your usage""

2. Also, we tried to use the following script on the NEA console server:
 
$targetname = ""ops...-nea01"" #Name of the computer you need to add the HTTP record to

$TRecord  = ""HTTP/""+(get-adcomputer $targetname ).DNSHostName + "" "" +  $env:USERDOMAIN+""""+$targetname+""""$"""""

We are thinking a quick call with you and Andy might be best to get fully back up to speed.","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-08-13T15:43:42.000Z","2024-08-13T15:43:42.000Z","false","false"
