I’m reaching out because I’d like to create an Active Directory (AD) report that shows the Department and Company fields for all users in the Main Users OU. Ideally, I’d like the report to display the following information for each user:
•First Name
•Last Name
•Department
•Company
Could you please guide me on how to set this up in Netwrix? I’d love to learn how to generate this kind of report myself for future use.

Thank you so much, 
Mawloda","Attempt to help build the needed report","We run on 11.6 and this does not impact the business immediately but its good to have this information for updates, and changes.
