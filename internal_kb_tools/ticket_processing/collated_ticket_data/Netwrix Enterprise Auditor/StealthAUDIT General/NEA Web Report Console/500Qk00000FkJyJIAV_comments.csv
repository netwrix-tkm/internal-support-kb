@Salesforce We just did a thorough testing of the CDSA and did not come across this issue. We'll queue this up on the backlog to be investigated

@Salesforce 
The following are screenshots and locations of source data
that were found in the attached CDSA. The summary page at the beginning of the
CDSA shows the total number of users and sites that were found in the
environment and those numbers are used in the calculation of the percentages
shown in the following slides.
Weak Passwords

Domain Users =

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [SA_ADInventory_UsersView] WHERE
[IsDeleted] = ‘False’

Weak Passwords =

SELECT * FROM SA_AD_WeakPasswords_Summary

Were ADI and the weak passwords jobs both run against the
same host list? Or is it possible the same host with multiple host names (i.e.
dc1 and dc1.domain.com) was scanned? According to the data it looks like more
users (or likely domains or even hosts) were scanned with weak passwords than
ADI. It is possible to get duplicated results for weak passwords if you scan
the same host with multiple names or by host name and IP.

SharePoint Open Access


Sites = SELECT * FROM [SA_SPAA_SiteCollectionsTraversalView]
WHERE [ResourceDescription] = ‘Site’


Open Access Sites =

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT [Site URL]) FROM  [SA_SP_OpenAccess_SiteCollectionSummary]

This summarizes open access by Site Collection, one level up
from sites, and should not be able to be higher than the total sites in the
TraversalView. Validate data in the SP_OpenAccess job in the
SP_OpenAccess_SiteCollectionSummary table. Compare the Site Collection and Site
URLs in this table with the SiteCollectionName and ResourceName columns
returned from the query of the SA_SPAA_SiteCollectionsTraversalView above.
Somehow more collections are being returned in the open access table than exist
in the TraversalView.

@Salesforce - the team has reviewed this and identified a bug with how we're calculating open access for sharepoint within the CDSA calculations. We have raised a work item to address this and will pull that onto a sprint as soon as bandwidth allows. This is unlikely to be pulled onto a sprint until late november at the earliest
