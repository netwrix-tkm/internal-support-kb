Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. There's currently an issue that our development team is actively investigating involving the published reports console not establishing and communicating over port 8082. You can verify this by checking the list of listening ports and searching for port 8082. Alternatively, if it's possible for the customer you can temporarily change the port to 8084 within the web configuration of the published reports. 

Thank you,

Hello Scottie,


Thanks, you were right that that port 8082 was not showing as listening.   Unfortunately, simply changing the port in the config file and restarting the service didn’t seem to fix it.  I also tried generating a self signed certificate and setting up SSL, then restarting the web server.  Still no luck, it’s still not showing listening.

I am going to need a technical person to come to a working session with the customer to help with this, it looks like.  I’m out of ideas on what could be causing this.

Our next working session is Friday (Jun28) at 2pm eastern time.  Is there any way you or someone else can join us then to try and get published reports working?

Hello Scottie,


Thanks, you were right that that port 8082 was not showing as listening.   Unfortunately, simply changing the port in the config file and restarting the service didn’t seem to fix it.  I also tried generating a self signed certificate and setting up SSL, then restarting the web server.  Still no luck, it’s still not showing listening.

I am going to need a technical person to come to a working session with the customer to help with this, it looks like.  I’m out of ideas on what could be causing this.

Our next working session is Friday (Jun28) at 2pm eastern time.  Is there any way you or someone else can join us then to try and get published reports working?

It's more so an issue that pertains to versions of NEA installed or upgraded after 11.6.19. We can still try one of the other workarounds to see if it will resolve the issue but we are also waiting for a possible rollback from development or an announcement.

You do understand that this is not an upgrade, but a brand new, install, correct?

Hi robert,

Thank you for the updated information. Unfortunately, those were all the possibilities that we've tried individually. There were issues that were involved in prior patching that caused this and waiting on developments update is the only thing we can do at this point regarding the issue. I have provided a meeting link below but at this stage of the process waiting for development updates is the only option. 

If you would like to schedule a meeting you may use the link below:

I’d rather not do an uninstall if we can help it, as we just installed.  I don’t think that’s a confidence-building scenario for a new customer, so let’s save that for the last resort.  Can we schedule someone to join our working session and make sure I haven’t missed anything on Friday?

There is one other alternative workaround but it's been a hit or miss that we've noticed with the installation of published reports. We have removed the webserver.config.exe file from the file path and performed a reinstallation of the application to allow for a new config file to be generated but it hasn't been fully successful. Development is currently testing and working on a fix for this issue but there's no official timeline. They've suggested a rollback but I understand that this is not an ideal situation.

Hello Scottie,

 

 

Thanks, you were right that that port 8082 was not showing as listening.   Unfortunately, simply changing the port in the config file and restarting the service didn’t seem to fix it.  I also tried generating a self signed certificate and setting up SSL, then restarting the web server.  Still no luck, it’s still not showing listening.  

 

I am going to need a technical person to come to a working session with the customer to help with this, it looks like.  I’m out of ideas on what could be causing this.

 

Our next working session is Friday (Jun28) at 2pm eastern time.  Is there any way you or someone else can join us then to try and get published reports working?

 

 

Best regards,

Hi robert,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. There's currently an issue that our development team is actively investigating involving the published reports console not establishing and communicating over port 8082. You can verify this by checking the list of listening ports and searching for port 8082. Alternatively, if it's possible for the customer you can temporarily change the port to 8084 within the web configuration of the published reports. 

Thank you,

Wow – that’s a terrible look for a new customer.   Also, I can’t even download an 11.6.x build earlier than that to revert to if we wanted to (or likely the SDD add-on that matches an earlier version).  I really am going to need someone from Netwrix to give this sort of news to the customer.  Maybe we will get lucky and a workaround will succeed.

It didn’t look like you were available at 2pm eastern (11am pacific) on Friday.  Is there any way you can arrange someone else to join my working session with the customer then?  The limited times you have I think are all going to be too late for the customer, and the one time you have on Thursday I already have a conflict with.  I don’t have independent access to the customer environment, so they have to be included in the call.

Wow – that’s a terrible look for a new customer.   Also, I can’t even download an 11.6.x build earlier than that to revert to if we wanted to (or likely the SDD add-on that matches an earlier version).  I really am going to need someone from Netwrix to give this sort of news to the customer.  Maybe we will get lucky and a workaround will succeed.

It didn’t look like you were available at 2pm eastern (11am pacific) on Friday.  Is there any way you can arrange someone else to join my working session with the customer then?  The limited times you have I think are all going to be too late for the customer, and the one time you have on Thursday I already have a conflict with.  I don’t have independent access to the customer environment, so they have to be included in the call.

-Robert

Hi robert,

It's more so an issue that pertains to versions of NEA installed or upgraded after 11.6.19. We can still try one of the other workarounds to see if it will resolve the issue but we are also waiting for a possible rollback from development or an announcement.

Thank you,

Hi robert,

I’d rather not do an uninstall if we can help it, as we just installed.  I don’t think that’s a confidence-building scenario for a new customer, so let’s save that for the last resort.  Can we schedule someone to join our working session and make sure I haven’t missed anything on Friday?

There is one other alternative workaround but it's been a hit or miss that we've noticed with the installation of published reports. We have removed the webserver.config.exe file from the file path and performed a reinstallation of the application to allow for a new config file to be generated but it hasn't been fully successful. Development is currently testing and working on a fix for this issue but there's no official timeline. They've suggested a rollback but I understand that this is not an ideal situation.

Hello Scottie,


Thanks, you were right that that port 8082 was not showing as listening.   Unfortunately, simply changing the port in the config file and restarting the service didn’t seem to fix it.  I also tried generating a self signed certificate and setting up SSL, then restarting the web server.  Still no luck, it’s still not showing listening.

I am going to need a technical person to come to a working session with the customer to help with this, it looks like.  I’m out of ideas on what could be causing this.

Our next working session is Friday (Jun28) at 2pm eastern time.  Is there any way you or someone else can join us then to try and get published reports working?

Hi robert,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. There's currently an issue that our development team is actively investigating involving the published reports console not establishing and communicating over port 8082. You can verify this by checking the list of listening ports and searching for port 8082. Alternatively, if it's possible for the customer you can temporarily change the port to 8084 within the web configuration of the published reports.

Thank you,

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) 11.6.0.79

The issue with the URL was that the service account was not a local admin and was getting Access Denied post starting the Service.
Once this was corrected we were able to load the URL without issue.


Reference the following for moving to HTTPS
Clear-Host
#Check Current cert details 
netsh http show sslcert
Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:LocalMachineMy |Select-Object -Property * |Sort-Object NotAfter |Sort-Object NotAfter -Descending |
Format-Table Thumbprint,Subject,FriendlyName, NotAfter -AutoSize

##netsh update SSL Cert

netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8082
$guid = ""bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8"" # This will be the same for all installations because it is a GUID from the built-in webserver application
$certHash = ""INSERT THUMBNAIL VALUE FROM STEP 2 BETWEEN QUOTES""
$ip = ""0.0.0.0"" # this means all IP addresses
$port = ""8082"" # the default HTTPS port
""http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}"" | netsh

## AIC 11.6+
netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:481
$guid = ""bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8"" # This will be the same for all installations because it is a GUID from the built-in webserver application
$certHash = ""INSERT THUMBNAIL VALUE FROM STEP 2 BETWEEN QUOTES""
$ip = ""0.0.0.0"" # this means all IP addresses
$port = ""481"" # the default HTTPS port
""http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}"" | netsh

The current status is that we scheduled a working session today with Dusty, and thank you for your efforts to make that happen.

 

I’m guessing this is some sort of automation that is emailing with this question.
