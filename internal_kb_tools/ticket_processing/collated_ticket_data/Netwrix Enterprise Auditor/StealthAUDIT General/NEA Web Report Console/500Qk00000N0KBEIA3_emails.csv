Please let us know how the KBs helped with the issues at hand.

I’m also re-aligning your ticket with an EMEA engineer to assist, and they will reach out with availability as soon as possible. 

I did not see that you and the customer were overseas.

Again, thank You for your time.

I am saying to only adjust the user for that service, this is because I assume that everything else is working.

This is only based upon the evidence that has been provided in this ticket.
If that account is already configured to run the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server then restart the service and/or re-check the password.

3) Here are how my 3 NEA services are configured in my environment:




Thank you,

Mark,

Please let us know how the KBs helped with the issues at hand.

I’m also re-aligning your ticket with an EMEA engineer to assist, and they will reach out with availability as soon as possible. 

I did not see that you and the customer were overseas.

Again, thank You for your time.

Its not RBA as we had the issue prior to adding any users to the NEA Console for RBA!! This is just  warning.

Sure lets setup  RBA on the call and run all the DB Scripts and create the Roles and then assign users with roles and cross fingers it works!

Personally I am not sure this is going to work myself but hopefully it does 😊

These were items that Tier 2 support requested at the end of last week and I should have obtained on the call today:

1) Please attach a screenshot of NEA > ""Settings"" > ""Reporting"" (I do not recall why I did not take the screenshot today on our call).
2) A copy of the web config file (WebServer.exe.config) found approximately here:

E:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITWeb

3) Have you tried re-creating the Report folder to see if this impacts the permissions issue?

4) We wanted to see a copy of the Windows Application Event Log since we think this might be a .NET error.

Thank you,
Mike Candon

Its not RBA as we had the issue prior to adding any users to the NEA Console for RBA!! This is just  warning. 

 

Sure lets setup  RBA on the call and run all the DB Scripts and create the Roles and then assign users with roles and cross fingers it works! 

 

Personally I am not sure this is going to work myself but hopefully it does 😊

Hi Mark,

I am not sure if we should walk through the steps for Securing Published Reports for starters.

I have a number of other artifacts to gather.

NEA v11.6 - Securing Published Reports Only
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Access/RoleBased/SecureReports.htm

Here is a meeting invite:

Hi Mike 

 

I thought I had sent this to help you but it looks like I might not have so I am sending it again. Attached is an email from the partner when I asked him to take screen shots of the trouble shooting we did and not just provide screenshots but add comments. 

 

Hoping this helps you even more

Hi Nicholas,

We have manged to identify that for the reporting site the issue is indeed permissions and have tested with domain users and are able to access the site:

[cid:image001.png@01DBA964.DBEEDDD0]


[cid:image002.jpg@01DBA964.DBEEDDD0]


With regards to the permission analyzer job we are still not successful with scanning even though we have a connection profile configured with elevated permissions (same cred we used to run weak password job). Please see error below:

Hi Mike

I thought I had sent this to help you but it looks like I might not have so I am sending it again. Attached is an email from the partner when I asked him to take screen shots of the trouble shooting we did and not just provide screenshots but add comments.

Hoping this helps you even more

Hi Nicholas,

 

We have manged to identify that for the reporting site the issue is indeed permissions and have tested with domain users and are able to access the site:

 



 

 



 

 

With regards to the permission analyzer job we are still not successful with scanning even though we have a connection profile configured with elevated permissions (same cred we used to run weak password job). Please see error below:

 



 

 

Please let us know when we can have a session to resolve.

Z

Any luck on this front or the other front for permissions?

I am still figuring out our best course of action on my side, but curious if you have had any success checking out permissions between the 2 accounts.

Thanks,
