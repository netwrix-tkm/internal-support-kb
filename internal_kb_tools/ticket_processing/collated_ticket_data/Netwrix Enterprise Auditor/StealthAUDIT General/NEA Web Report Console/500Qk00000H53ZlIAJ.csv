"500Qk00000H53ZlIAJ","00424021","Support Ticket","Certificate Renewal","Good Afternoon,
I have renewed our netwrix cert thru our cert mgr, but I am not sure how to or where to bind it.  There are no certs showing currently bound in IIS, but our internal web portal certs are showing as valid.  I have read several online articles, but do not see where and how to bind it.  Can you please send instructions on how I can bind my new cert?  This is rather critical because our cert expires in 2 days.  

Thanks in advance for your assistance and sorry for the short notice.

Much Appreciation,
Beth","","","","+++++
