According to Carlos, restarting the service had no impact on the problem. We saw the service go through a ""restart"" during the session but when reviewing the logs, no restarting of the service was recorded. Reboot failed to fix the problem so we went with reinstalling NEA as the next step. Web console is now running without issue post reinstall. 

I will proceed with closing this ticket out. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if any other issues pop up during the POC.

Thank you,
