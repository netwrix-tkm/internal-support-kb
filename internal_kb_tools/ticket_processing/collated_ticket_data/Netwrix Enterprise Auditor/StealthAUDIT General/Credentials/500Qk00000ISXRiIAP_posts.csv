Good morning. My name is Jesse Duran. I'm with Honeywell, I'm not able to log into the network support site. Um, I've entered my email and password and it just sits there. So if you can give me a call at 804-389-1471, I'd appreciate it. Your earliest convenience.","","","","00570000002p2NxAAI","2024-11-18T13:14:14.000Z"

jessie.doran@honeywell.com

I got on a call with customer, they explained that they are trying to upload new artifacts to the ticket 00422947 but unable to do so because they can not log in to customer portal using this email address:
jessie.doran@honeywell.com

As such, Jessie left a voicemail, stating that they are unable to login to Customer Portal - as a result this new ticket was created 00427379. 

Jessie needs assistance with getting access to their jessie.doran@honeywell.com account on the Netwrix Customer Portal","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2024-11-18T13:36:48.000Z"

Since Scott Stefani is specified as the end contact in 00422947 - as a workaround I asked Jessie to contact Scott to see if they can upload needed logs for a ticket mentioned above using Scott Stefani Netwrix customer account.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2024-11-18T13:53:59.000Z"
