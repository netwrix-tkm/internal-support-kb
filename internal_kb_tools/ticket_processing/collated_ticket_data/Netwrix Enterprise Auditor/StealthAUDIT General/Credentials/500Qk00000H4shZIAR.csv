"500Qk00000H4shZIAR","00424018","Support Ticket","the app has never been setup for Hash based authentication.","Looking at the application in CyberArk, the app has never been setup for Hash based authentication. It is setup via “OS User” as seen in the attached image. 

Also, if the app was setup this way in CyberArk, per CyberArk’s documentation, we would need to create a new hash for the app in CyberArk every time there was an update to the app. Since this is the first time we’ve had to do anything to the app in CyberArk since the initial setup, I do not believe this is the issue. If need be, I will be more than happy to get a meeting scheduled and further discuss this issue.

Following an upgrade of Enterprise Auditor credentials could not be retrieved from CyberArk

Cause
Two values were cleared or corrupted during the upgrade:
1. The AppID value ""StealthAUDIT"" had to be entered into %sainstalldir%StealthAUDITGlobalOptions.xml
2. The Folder value was cleared from the Credential Profile.


Resolution
Following the Enterprise Auditor Documentation at
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Connection/CyberArkIntegration.htm

We updated the correct tag in GlobalOptions.xml with the AppID defined in CyberArk
We entered the folder ""Root"" into the credential profile

We initiated a run of the Active Directory Inventory we successfully pulled credentials from CyberArk and began scanning.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Scottie Taylor","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Credentials","11.6","","0.8","Closed - Resolved","American Fidelity Assurance Company","Calvin Minnick","2024-10-15T20:14:56.000Z","2024-10-16T14:37:29.000Z"
