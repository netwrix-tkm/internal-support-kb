"00aQk000008qCN4IAM","500Qk00000F5ym5IAB","We were able to identify the issue as a possible permission-based issue with the admin account used to access the NEA application. We attempted to reset the storage profile node by removing the profile information within the SPProfiles.xml file and only leaving the information below:

<SPPROFILES>
    <SCHEMAVERSION>1.0.0</SCHEMAVERSION>
    <PROFILES> </PROFILES>
</SPPROFILES>

I was able to test this method in my lab and verified that the account that I'm currently using has a dbo schema under the NEA database as well as the master database. Please let me know if moving the account to the master db resolves this issue for you. If you still experience issues I have provided a meeting link below.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-08-30T20:07:12.000Z","2024-08-30T20:07:12.000Z","false","false"
