I have validated the password and manually reset it within the Connection Profiles.  Previously, there was an additional domain having this issue, but that was a copy/paste issue and has been resolved.

I have separated the schedules for my jobs to try to help troubleshoot this issue.  Each job runs on a different night (currently setup to stop after 8 hours).

Most recently, the account (ondemandsvcAuditor) locked this morning at 9:35am.  All my jobs run at 1:30 or 2am overnight.

The GROUP_Windows ran last night at 2am. It uses ALL DOMAIN CONTROLLERS for its host list.  Again, this is only impacting 1 of 7 domains I have.  I'm not sure where to look to investigate this further.  It may be related to issues I'm seeing in ticket 431038.  I have a call scheduled on Monday for that ticket.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-10T15:55:00.000Z"

NEA jobs run between 1am and 3am and take less than 1 hour to complete. Lockout occured at 9:30am so the times don't line up.

NEA users are sometimes getting locked out and the issue seems to be related to the ADI job running. We tested the account and noticed that the logs are not passing the domain along with the user name.","","","","005Qk000002AJWTIA4","2025-01-31T20:08:46.000Z"
