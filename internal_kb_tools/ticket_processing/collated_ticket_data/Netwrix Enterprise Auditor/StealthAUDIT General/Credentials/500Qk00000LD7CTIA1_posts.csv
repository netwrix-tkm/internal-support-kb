I'm getting this error right before the initial configurations, when Enterprise Auditor checks SQL authentication.
I already had this issue at a client and as I remember its RBAC related error, and was solved changing one specific registry if I'm not mistaken.
My user is a domain admin, and has full permission at sql server also

Can you please help me with that?

Thanks a lot!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-29T12:32:17.000Z"

According to this error message - ""Default storage profile is missing"", issue might be caused by lack of permissions on the NEA sql db. 
If windows account is used for SQL connection, then the user account that tries to open NEA console must also have SQL permissions.
