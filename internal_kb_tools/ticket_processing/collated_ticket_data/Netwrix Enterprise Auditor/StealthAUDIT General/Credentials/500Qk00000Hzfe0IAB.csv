"500Qk00000Hzfe0IAB","00426335","Support Ticket","Beyond Trust integration","Customer is inquiring whether Netwrix Enterprise Auditor has integration with BeyondTrust Privileged Access Management solution similar to the integration with CyberArk described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Connection/CyberArkIntegration.htm","Not applicable.","NEA supports integration with CyberArk PAM by using CyberArk as a password storage. 

Integration configuration is described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Connection/CyberArkIntegration.htm

Customer would like to know if Netwrix Enterprise Auditor supports similar integration with BeyondTrust PAM solution. 
According to information in NEA helpcenter currently there is no built-in integration with BeyondTrust available.

As an alternative, support suggested customer to consider using Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) as it is more secure than standard service account due to automated and delegated account management. 

More info on gMSA in this Microsoft Article:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview

To enable usage of Group Managed Service Accounts it must be selected in the User Credentials window when creating a Connection Profile as described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Connection/gMSA.htm

See the ""Create Connection Profile article"" for information on how to configure connection profile credentials:

or gMSA can also be used in the schedule service account connection profile as described in ""Create a Schedule Service"" article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Schedule.htm#_Create_a_Schedule_1","Support will prepare a feature request.
Support asked customer to provide answers to these questions to ensure proper Feature Request:
1 Please, elaborate on what is the use case for using BeyondTrust with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.  
2 Please, describe how you would like to see the implementation of BeyondTrust integration with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. Preferably, provide as much details as you can.","Question:
Does Netwrix Enterprise Auditor support integration with BeyondTrust Privileged Access Management solution similar to the integration with CyberArk. 

Answer:
Currently Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (formerly StealthAudit) does not have built-it integration with BeyondTrust Privileged Access Management solution.
Integration with CyberArk was introduced as a feature dedicated for that purpose only and cannot be adjusted to support BeyondTrust integration. 

As an alternative, support recommend trying out Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) as they are supported in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and can be configured to be used in Connection Profile settings. 
Group Managed Service Accounts provide better security over Service Accounts by automating and delegating service accounts` management.
