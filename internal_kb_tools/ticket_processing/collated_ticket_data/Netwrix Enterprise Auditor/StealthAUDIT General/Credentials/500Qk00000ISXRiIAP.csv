"500Qk00000ISXRiIAP","00427379","Support Ticket","Customer Portal Access","Customer needs to share the logging information regarding ticket 00422947. 
Customer can not share the logs because they are unable to login to Customer Portal.","","End customer is Jessie Doran. 
jessie.doran@honeywell.com
Customer needs assistance with getting access to their jessie.doran@honeywell.com account on the Netwrix Customer Portal 

I got on a call with customer, they explained that they are trying to upload new artifacts to the ticket 00422947 but unable to do so because they can not log in to customer portal using this email address:
jessie.doran@honeywell.com

As such, Jessie left a voicemail, stating that they are unable to login to Customer Portal - as a result this new ticket was created 00427379.","Case is for the US time zone. 
As such, I am moving ticket to the Team Lead queue.

Since Scott Stefani is specified as the end contact in 00422947 - as a workaround I asked Jessie to contact Scott to see if they can upload needed logs for a ticket mentioned above using Scott Stefani Netwrix customer account.","Customer did not have access to customer portal. 

Verified account is active in portal and reset the password via https://dev3.netwrix.com/adm

Customer confirmed ability to access portal","Data validation / interpretation","Brandon West","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Credentials","","","1.2","Closed - Resolved","Honeywell International","Jesse Doran","2024-11-18T13:14:14.000Z","2024-11-19T16:53:18.000Z"
