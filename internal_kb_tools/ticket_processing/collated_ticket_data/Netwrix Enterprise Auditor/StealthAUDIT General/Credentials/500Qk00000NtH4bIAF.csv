"500Qk00000NtH4bIAF","00441533","Support Ticket","Session timeout","We like to know if there is a session timeout setting for the desktop application running from Stealth Audit server, where we can make configuration change for the application. This is not the timeout session for web console access.","","We never try to use NTLM, only what Windows processes.
There are certain steps that will fail if we cannot authenticate through Kerberos.
However there is nothing that relies on NTLM.

1) A few years ago we checked the product since Windows was going to get rid of the option to have NTLM enabled/disable it by default if that would affect the product and we found that it wasn't the case that we default to NTLM.

2) We do use Kerberos unless the environment specifies to use NTLM and you enter IP addresses in the product (this isn't always supported depending on part of the product being configured).

In our environment, NTLM and Kerberos are both enabled, so we need to understand by default is the product use NTLM or it tries Kerberos first and then fail back to NTLM if Kerberos is not supported.
