"500Qk00000MoBZxIAN","00438449","Support Ticket","Failed logins","We're seeing failed logins from the server hosting Netwrix Enterprise Auditor in our SIEM and that's the only thing this server is running. Seems like they started yesterday when I was on the server doing some things in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor but I can't figure out what might be causing it. Was wondering if there is anything we can check in the logs in NEA that might explain what is happening. 

The logins are showing as my ID and any jobs in NEA should be running with a service account and not my account. I did try changing a setting on a reporting feature yesterday and I have changed it back but the logins are still occurring.","","The customer is receiving a failed login alert for his account in his SIEM, and the alert is from the NEA server.","","Updated the password in Activity Monitor for his user account.","Guidance","Frantz Baptiste","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Credentials","11.6","","3.3","Closed - Resolved","International Motors, LLC","William Dammeier","2025-03-11T16:57:44.000Z","2025-03-14T23:24:32.000Z"
