I'm getting this error right before the initial configurations, when Enterprise Auditor checks SQL authentication.
I already had this issue at a client and as I remember its RBAC related error, and was solved changing one specific registry if I'm not mistaken.
My user is a domain admin, and has full permission at sql server also

Can you please help me with that?

Thanks a lot!","Install NEA 11.6.0.127 and configure SQL server authentication. 
When trying to start NEA console this error appears:
Default storage profile is missing","Customer installed NEA 11.6.0.127. but is unable to open console due to this error:
Default storage profile is missing

In previous history issue was known to be resolved after re-installing NEA from scratch. 

Similar cases:

According to this error message - ""Default storage profile is missing"", issue might be caused by lack of permissions on the NEA sql db.
