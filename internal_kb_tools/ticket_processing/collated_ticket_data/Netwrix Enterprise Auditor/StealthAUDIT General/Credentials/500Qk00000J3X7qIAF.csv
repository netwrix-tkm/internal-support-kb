It is stated
""The account that Enterprise Auditor is run with must have permissions to retrieve the gMSA account password""


Is this referencing the accounts running netwrix enterprise auditor web server? (aka <a href='https://services.msc' target='_blank'>services.msc</a>)

OR

is this referencing members of the groups we've given admin access to (Settings>Access>member, member type, access type, role) 

because we're getting permissions denied with the GMSA account we created and are unsure which account may or may not need additional permissions. 

please define what ""The account that Enterprise Auditor is run with"" means and what setting would be the source of truth for this.","","","","Symptom:
Customer wants to utilize gMSA for NEA console and data collection, needed clarification on ""The account that Enterprise Auditor is run with must have permissions to retrieve the gMSA account password""
Cause:
Limitations on how NEA functions when using gMSA(s)

Resolution:
R&D noted that the account running the scheduled task or the console during interactive job execution. If scheduled tasks are running as System, then the computer object in AD needs the gMSA account password retrieval capability, if running as a service account, then that service account. 
 
Interactive users running the NEA console would also need gMSA account password retrieval capability. This is to manually kick off the job(s) from the right click menu option.

Contacts last replay:
You can cancel this request, we’re going to stop the effort of converting to gmsa.

We wanted to convert to gmsa to make it simpler/less manual effort (manually rotating creds/updating it in the console/services)

however the way Netwrix implemented gmsa requires us to deviate from standard processes (assign perms to server to retrieve gmsa creds)

to 
gmsa perms assigned to server + service account + multiple checkout accounts we use to RDP to the server …","Guidance","Dusty Grayson","Question","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Credentials","11.6","","1.0","Closed - Resolved","Bremer Bank","Matthew Mayavski","2024-12-03T21:06:08.000Z","2024-12-04T20:18:43.000Z"
