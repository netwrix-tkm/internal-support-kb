Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:

	Discussed where the password lives for each of the Netwrix products you have installed
	Discussed potentially using CyberArk for NEA/StealthAUDIT
	Submitted feature requests to have cyberark integrations added to Activity Monitor, StealthINTERCEPT, and StealthDEFEND.


Let me know if you or your team has any follow up questions or if we're good to close this one out.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri
