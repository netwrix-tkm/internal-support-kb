It is stated
""The account that Enterprise Auditor is run with must have permissions to retrieve the gMSA account password""


Is this referencing the accounts running netwrix enterprise auditor web server? (aka <a href='https://services.msc' target='_blank'>services.msc</a>)

OR

is this referencing members of the groups we've given admin access to (Settings>Access>member, member type, access type, role) 

because we're getting permissions denied with the GMSA account we created and are unsure which account may or may not need additional permissions. 

please define what ""The account that Enterprise Auditor is run with"" means and what setting would be the source of truth for this.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-03T21:06:09.000Z"
