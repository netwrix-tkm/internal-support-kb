It is unfortunate that you have encountered this issue.

1) Did you already successfully reset the password for the ""svcStealthAudit"" account and confirm that you can remote desktop into the server indicated in the screenshot attached to this case before running the NEA job? 

2) From what I can see in the screenshot, you are attempting to remote desktop (RDC) into the computer on the ""FICOCLOUDDEV.COM"" domain and the message indicates that ""the user account is disabled and cannot be used"".  I believe that you need to contact your internal IT support and/or network/domain administrator and ask them to enable the ""svcStealthAudit"" account on that domain.  Until this issue is resolved, NEA will continue to error with the message that ""The supplied credential is invalid"".

Thank you,
Mike Candon

Hi Team,


  1.  Did you already successfully reset the password for the ""svcStealthAudit"" account and confirm that you can remote desktop into the server indicated in the screenshot attached to this case before running the NEA job?

  *   Yes I can do remote login with same password but while the job I used to get creditionals invalid.

2) From what I can see in the screenshot, you are attempting to remote desktop (RDC) into the computer on the ""FICOCLOUDDEV.COM"" domain and the message indicates that ""the user account is disabled and cannot be used"".  I believe that you need to contact your internal IT support and/or network/domain administrator and ask them to enable the ""svcStealthAudit"" account on that domain.  Until this issue is resolved, NEA will continue to error with the message that ""The supplied credential is invalid"".
  *   They have unlocked the account, as the creditionals are getting invalid that’s why it was locked

Hi Team,

 


	Did you already successfully reset the password for the ""svcStealthAudit"" account and confirm that you can remote desktop into the server indicated in the screenshot attached to this case before running the NEA job? 



	Yes I can do remote login with same password but while the job I used to get creditionals invalid.
	
	2) From what I can see in the screenshot, you are attempting to remote desktop (RDC) into the computer on the ""FICOCLOUDDEV.COM"" domain and the message indicates that ""the user account is disabled and cannot be used"".  I believe that you need to contact your internal IT support and/or network/domain administrator and ask them to enable the ""svcStealthAudit"" account on that domain.  Until this issue is resolved, NEA will continue to error with the message that ""The supplied credential is invalid"".
	They have unlocked the account, as the creditionals are getting invalid that’s why it was locked
	
	 


 


Thanks & Regards

Hi Chandan,

It is unfortunate that you have encountered this issue.

1) Did you already successfully reset the password for the ""svcStealthAudit"" account and confirm that you can remote desktop into the server indicated in the screenshot attached to this case before running the NEA job? 

2) From what I can see in the screenshot, you are attempting to remote desktop (RDC) into the computer on the ""FICOCLOUDDEV.COM"" domain and the message indicates that ""the user account is disabled and cannot be used"".  I believe that you need to contact your internal IT support and/or network/domain administrator and ask them to enable the ""svcStealthAudit"" account on that domain.  Until this issue is resolved, NEA will continue to error with the message that ""The supplied credential is invalid"".

Thank you,

Hello Team,

Just checking to see if this issue was resolved?

This statement sounded like it has been.
""They have unlocked the account, as the creditionals are getting invalid that’s why it was locked""

If I am mistaken feel free to reach back out and we will see if we can get things rolling.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hi Team,


  1.  Did you already successfully reset the password for the ""svcStealthAudit"" account and confirm that you can remote desktop into the server indicated in the screenshot attached to this case before running the NEA job?

•         Yes I can do remote login with same password but while the job I used to get creditionals invalid.

2) From what I can see in the screenshot, you are attempting to remote desktop (RDC) into the computer on the ""FICOCLOUDDEV.COM"" domain and the message indicates that ""the user account is disabled and cannot be used"".  I believe that you need to contact your internal IT support and/or network/domain administrator and ask them to enable the ""svcStealthAudit"" account on that domain.  Until this issue is resolved, NEA will continue to error with the message that ""The supplied credential is invalid"".

•         They have unlocked the account, as the creditionals are getting invalid that’s why it was locked



Thanks & Regards

Hi Chandan,

It is unfortunate that you have encountered this issue.

1) Did you already successfully reset the password for the ""svcStealthAudit"" account and confirm that you can remote desktop into the server indicated in the screenshot attached to this case before running the NEA job?

2) From what I can see in the screenshot, you are attempting to remote desktop (RDC) into the computer on the ""FICOCLOUDDEV.COM"" domain and the message indicates that ""the user account is disabled and cannot be used"".  I believe that you need to contact your internal IT support and/or network/domain administrator and ask them to enable the ""svcStealthAudit"" account on that domain.  Until this issue is resolved, NEA will continue to error with the message that ""The supplied credential is invalid"".

Thank you,

Hello Chandra,

Thank you for sharing these details. This issue looks to be with the Stealth Audit Software, This is a software that I am currently not trained to support. I am going to go ahead and get this case transferred to an engineer who can assist you.
