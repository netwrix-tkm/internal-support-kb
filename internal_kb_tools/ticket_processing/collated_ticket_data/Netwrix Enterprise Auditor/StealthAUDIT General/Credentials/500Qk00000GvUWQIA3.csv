2. Where is the password being updated on the system? (i.e. services, task, xml file, etc)","","","","Discussed where the passwords for NEA, NAM, AIC, NTM, and NTP are. We currently have a cyberark integration for NEA that the customer may leverage since that is their current password vault provider. We also submitted feature requests to have a cyberark integration added to NAM, NTM, and NTP.

Also provided the customer with a copy of the Password Change guide I built for them with the various places in their environment a password needs changed (attached to SF Account under Related)","Guidance","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Credentials","11.5","","33.3","Closed - Resolved","ConocoPhillips Company","Frank McNickle","2024-10-11T15:32:38.000Z","2024-11-13T22:57:24.000Z"
