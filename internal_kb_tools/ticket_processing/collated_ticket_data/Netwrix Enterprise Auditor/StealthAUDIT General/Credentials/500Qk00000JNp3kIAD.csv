"500Qk00000JNp3kIAD","00429591","Support Ticket","Account Removal","Hi all,

Since we have decided not to renew our licenses for the Netwrix software, I was asked to have our Netwrix data/accounts purged, with an email confirmation of removal sent to our team. I believe Keith Kraemer and I are the last two that have accounts in the Netwrix portal, but it is possible I did not have previous members of our team removed from our account. Confirmation of the account/data removal can be sent to <a href='https://Justin.Burlando@anbbank.com' target='_blank'>Justin.Burlando@anbbank.com</a> and <a href='https://Keith.Kraemer@anbbank.com' target='_blank'>Keith.Kraemer@anbbank.com</a>.

Thank you,
Justin Burlando","","--------
