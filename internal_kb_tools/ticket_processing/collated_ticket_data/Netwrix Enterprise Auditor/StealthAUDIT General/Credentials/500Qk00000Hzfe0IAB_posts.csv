As an alternative, support suggested customer to consider using Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) as it is more secure than standard service account due to automated and delegated account management. 

More info on gMSA in this Microsoft Article:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview

To enable usage of Group Managed Service Accounts it must be selected in the User Credentials window when creating a Connection Profile as described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Connection/gMSA.htm

See the ""Create Connection Profile article"" for information on how to configure connection profile credentials:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Connection/Profile/Create.htm

or gMSA can also be used in the schedule service account connection profile as described in ""Create a Schedule Service"" article:
