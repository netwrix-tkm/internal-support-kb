Hello Jessie,

Thank you for the update, I'm sorry this no behaving as intended.  I'm reaching out to our web team to understand what is unique about your account.

In the meantime, I think you had mentioned transferring files via your onedrive?  While this isn't our normal transfer process I can ensure they get placed only in our managed storage. Please share the OneDrive folder or files to Brandon.West@netwrix.com.

I tried to register again last week, below is the conformation email that I verified.  I had done this a long time ago when I started here about 2 years ago as well.  I am not sure why I am not showing up as registered, this is the 2nd or 3rd time I have tried to do this.

Hi Jesse,

I have confirmed that the reason you are not able to log into Netwrix Customer Portal is because you have not registered as a user.  Neither Jessie.Doran@honeywell.com or  Jesse.Doran@honeywell.com are registered.

How to register is described here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/NetwrixCustomerPortalAccess/page/Customer_Portal_Access.html

After which you will be able to see an manager any tickets you create. We can also enable a feature so that you and Scott can see and manager each other's tickets.

Please use this link if it would be helpful to work on your registration and upload together, I have time available this afternoon: https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=8Y8xa1jmIeK_ENtGiUkWd4owH2SvIp_zVjRyGMJm9D4-Z&MeetingID=iafK0uiZlRQ0IcNwOiu3LIdtiY8YkKDOhns3u8j2UDA-Z

Hello Jessie, 

Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support.
My name is Artem, we spoke earlier today about an issue you are experiencing with customer portal.

As we discussed, you are unable to login to Netwrix Customer portal using your account`s credentials jessie.doran@honeywell.com.
Please, allow us some time to look into this issue from our side. 

In the meantime, may I ask you to contact Scott Stefani from Honeywell and use his customer account to upload needed logging information to 00422947 ticket? 

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA
