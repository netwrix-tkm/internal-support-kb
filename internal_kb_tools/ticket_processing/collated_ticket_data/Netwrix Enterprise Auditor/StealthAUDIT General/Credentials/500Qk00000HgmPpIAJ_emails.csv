Hello James,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, I discovered some issues with the Bulk Import scan. I reset the host data and rescanned the Bulk Import.
You are currently scanning the File System scan (FSAA). When the scan is completed, rerun the Bulk Import and send me a screenshot of the error or warning from the message for both (Bulk Import and System Scan).
 
You can use the link below to schedule the follow-up meeting.
