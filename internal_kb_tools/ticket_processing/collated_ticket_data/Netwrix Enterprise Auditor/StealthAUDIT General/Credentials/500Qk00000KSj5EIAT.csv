"500Qk00000KSj5EIAT","00431727","Support Ticket","Connection profile account locking out from NEA","I have 1 domain account that is used in 2 different connection profiles that keeps locking itself out (not the same Windows account used elsewhere in NEA for SQL and Tasks).  I have validated the password and manually reset it within the Connection Profiles.  Previously, there was an additional domain having this issue, but that was a copy/paste issue and has been resolved.

I have separated the schedules for my jobs to try to help troubleshoot this issue.  Each job runs on a different night (currently setup to stop after 8 hours).

Most recently, the account (ondemandsvcAuditor) locked this morning at 9:35am.  All my jobs run at 1:30 or 2am overnight.

The GROUP_Windows ran last night at 2am. It uses ALL DOMAIN CONTROLLERS for its host list.  Again, this is only impacting 1 of 7 domains I have.  I'm not sure where to look to investigate this further.  It may be related to issues I'm seeing in ticket 431038.  I have a call scheduled on Monday for that ticket.","","Service account is getting locked out and customer thought it was due to jobs in NEA.
NEA jobs run between 1am and 3am and take less than 1 hour to complete. Lockout occured at 9:30am so the times don't line up.

Customer setup NTP to audit logins and authentications to try and track what may be triggering the account lockout.

--------
NEA users are sometimes getting locked out and the issue seems to be related to the ADI job running. We tested the account and noticed that the logs are not passing the domain along with the user name.","Awaiting event logs from customer.","Symptom
Service accunt being used by NEA was being locked out periodically.

Cause
Unknown cause as the issue was external to netwrix products. The account was being locked out during a time when no netwrix products were running with the acccount.

Resolution
Assisted customer in setting up NTP monitoring of failed logins of the accoun to track the source of the issue, customer resolved it on their own after this.","Guidance","Ian Ranstrom","Error","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Credentials","11.6","","32.0","Closed - Resolved","Nexidia","Angie Sawyer","2025-01-10T15:54:58.000Z","2025-02-11T16:14:07.000Z"
