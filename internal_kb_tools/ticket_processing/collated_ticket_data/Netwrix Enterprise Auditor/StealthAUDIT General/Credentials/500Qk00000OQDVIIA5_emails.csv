I figured it out.  I followed that documentation.  The problem is that it does not at all mention that if, in Access Information Center, if you set the Configuration credentials under Active Directory, they must be changed prior to changing the service account password or while still logged in.  I deleted this setting from the AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.Config and was then able to login and reset it to the new password.
