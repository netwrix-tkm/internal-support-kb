Seems like they started yesterday when I was on the server doing some things in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor but I can't figure out what might be causing it. Was wondering if there is anything we can check in the logs in NEA that might explain what is happening. 

The logins are showing as my ID and any jobs in NEA should be running with a service account and not my account. I did try changing a setting on a reporting feature yesterday and I have changed it back but the logins are still occurring.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-11T16:57:45.000Z"
