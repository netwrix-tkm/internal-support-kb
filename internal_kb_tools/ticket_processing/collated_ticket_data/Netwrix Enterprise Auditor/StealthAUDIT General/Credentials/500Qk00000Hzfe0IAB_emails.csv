Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. 
My name is Artem, and I will be assisting you with this ticket. 

Currently Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (formerly StealthAudit) does not have built-it integration with BeyondTrust Privileged Access Management solution.
Integration with CyberArk was introduced as a feature dedicated for that purpose only and cannot be adjusted to support BeyondTrust integration. 

As an alternative, I would recommend trying out Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA) as they are supported in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and can be configured to be used in Connection Profile settings. 
Group Managed Service Accounts provide better security over Service Accounts by automating and delegating service accounts` management. 
Refer to this Microsoft Article for more information about gMSA:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview

To enable usage of Group Managed Service Accounts it must be selected in the User Credentials window when creating a Connection Profile as described in this article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Connection/gMSA.htm
See the ""Create Connection Profile article"" for information on how to configure connection profile credentials:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Connection/Profile/Create.htm
or gMSA can also be used in the schedule service account connection profile as described in ""Create a Schedule Service"" article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Schedule.htm#_Create_a_Schedule_1

Regarding BeyondTrust, I can post a feature request for such integration to our Product Management team. 
To make sure we submit feature request accordingly, please, provide additional information:


	Please, elaborate on what is the use case for using BeyondTrust with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.  
	Please, describe how you would like to see the implementation of BeyondTrust integration with Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. Preferably, provide as much details as you can. 


I am looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA
