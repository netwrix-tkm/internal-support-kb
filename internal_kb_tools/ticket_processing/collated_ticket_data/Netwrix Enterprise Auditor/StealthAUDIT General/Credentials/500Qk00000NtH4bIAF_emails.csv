There is no timeout on the StealthAUDIT application.

Hi Mike,

It is not the web console timeout, which I already verified and works as expected.

I am wondering if there is timeout session with the server application GUI. In addition, I also like to ask:


  1.  Is the web console only for viewing report?
  2.  Is there a web GUI/console to configure application settings, like the application GUI on the installed server?

Thanks.

Hi,

Is this setting to control the timeout for web console only? I launched the application from the server and open the console for more than 2 hours. I don’t see timeout at all. Unlike the web console, after 15 minutes, it shows timeout and I have to close the browser and relaunch the browser.

Hi Rick,

Here is my test:

1) Browser = Microsoft Edge Version 135.0.3179.66 (Official build) (64-bit)
2) Installed NEA version v11.6.0.138 - NEA Published Reports for this version of NEA
3) Set SessionTimeout in ""WebServer.exe.Config"" to 1 minute and restarted the NEA Web Server service. (You must restart the NEA Web Server service.)
4) Logged into NEA Published Reports.
5) Do not move around or click anything in the NEA Published Reports for 1 full minute.
6) After 1 full minute try to refresh the ""Home"" page in ""NEA Published Reports"" that you logged into in Step 4.
7) Actual (and Expected) Behavior: I am logged out and the ""NEA Published Reports"" Sign in page is what I see in my browser.

8)  I conducted a second test where I set the: [Set SessionTimeout in ""WebServer.exe.Config"" to 5 minutes and restarted the NEA Web Server service.]
9) Login, do nothing and wait over 1 minute and then refresh the NEA Published Reports home page.
10) Expected and Actual Behavior: I was not logged out.

Hi,

Is this setting to control the timeout for web console only? I launched the application from the server and open the console for more than 2 hours. I don’t see timeout at all. Unlike the web console, after 15 minutes, it shows timeout and I have to close the browser and relaunch the browser.

Hi Mike,

It is not the web console timeout, which I already verified and works as expected.

I am wondering if there is timeout session with the server application GUI. In addition, I also like to ask:


  1.  Is the web console only for viewing report?
  2.  Is there a web GUI/console to configure application settings, like the application GUI on the installed server?

Thanks.

Hi Jared,

There is no timeout on the StealthAUDIT application.
I confirmed this with Paul Pitas.
Is this specifically what you are referring to?

We acknowledge that you are not referring to:

Hi Mike,

What is the authentication method used for GUI? Is it Kerberos or NTLM or something else? We login with Windows AD account, so I assume it is either Kerberos or NTLM.

Is there are setting to verify that, or from log to verify the authentication method?

These are some of the questions asked by our IT risk team.

Hi Rick,

There is no configurable timeout setting for the NEA Enterprise Auditor GUI as you have displayed in your last screenshot.

Thank you,

Hi Rick,

Here is my test:

1) Browser = Microsoft Edge Version 135.0.3179.66 (Official build) (64-bit)
2) Installed NEA version v11.6.0.138 - NEA Published Reports for this version of NEA
3) Set SessionTimeout in ""WebServer.exe.Config"" to 1 minute and restarted the NEA Web Server service. (You must restart the NEA Web Server service.)
4) Logged into NEA Published Reports.
5) Do not move around or click anything in the NEA Published Reports for 1 full minute.
6) After 1 full minute try to refresh the ""Home"" page in ""NEA Published Reports"" that you logged into in Step 4.
7) Actual (and Expected) Behavior: I am logged out and the ""NEA Published Reports"" Sign in page is what I see in my browser.

8)  I conducted a second test where I set the: [Set SessionTimeout in ""WebServer.exe.Config"" to 5 minutes and restarted the NEA Web Server service.]
9) Login, do nothing and wait over 1 minute and then refresh the NEA Published Reports home page.
10) Expected and Actual Behavior: I was not logged out.


Thank you,

Hi,

 

Is this setting to control the timeout for web console only? I launched the application from the server and open the console for more than 2 hours. I don’t see timeout at all. Unlike the web console, after 15 minutes, it shows timeout and I have to close the browser and relaunch the browser.

 

<add key=""SessionTimeout"" value=""15"" />

Hi Rick,

Here are the answers to your questions:

1) Is the web console only for viewing report?

ANSWER: Yes, the NAA (or NEA) Published Reports console is only for viewing reports.

 

2) Is there a web GUI/console OPTION to configure application settings, like the application GUI on the installed server?

ANSWER: Yes, There is a configurable ""SessionTimeout"" in the ""WebServer.exe.Config"" for the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Web Server service.

 

""E:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITWebWebServer.exe.Config""

<add key=""SessionTimeout"" value=""15"" />

Hi Mike,

 

It is not the web console timeout, which I already verified and works as expected. 

 

I am wondering if there is timeout session with the server application GUI. In addition, I also like to ask:

 


	Is the web console only for viewing report?
	Is there a web GUI/console to configure application settings, like the application GUI on the installed server?


 

Thanks.

Hi Jared,

There is no timeout on the StealthAUDIT application.
I confirmed this with Paul Pitas.
Is this specifically what you are referring to?

We acknowledge that you are not referring to:

NEA v11.6 - Timeout Parameter for the Web Console

Hi,

I have one more question. Within the application, is there a setting to manage active session timeout? For example, I am actively working on the session but after certain amount of time (like max to 12 hours), the session will be terminated even I am still actively working in the session.

Thanks.

Hi,

I have one more question. Within the application, is there a setting to manage active session timeout? For example, I am actively working on the session but after certain amount of time (like max to 12 hours), the session will be terminated even I am still actively working in the session.

Thanks.

Hi Mike,

I think this feature may be required by another team at RBC who uses this production to support other applications.

At this point, per my discussion with our security team, if the application uses Kerberos authentication, then this active session timeout is not required. If the application uses NTLM authentication, then active session timeout is needed.

My question below is whether you can confirm if Stealth Audit software uses Kerberos authentication or not. If yes, is there a registration key or configure setting to prove that? If Kerberos is not turned on by default, can we turn it on? If Kerberos is not supported, then we have to go back to the active session timeout feature, and  we also like to know which version will support Kerberos since NTLM is outdated with vulnerabilities, even Microsoft plans to stop supporting this in the near future.

Thanks.

I have one more question. Within the application, is there a setting to manage active session timeout? For example, I am actively working on the session but after certain amount of time (like max to 12 hours), the session will be terminated even I am still actively working in the session.

Thanks.

Rick He

Hi Mike,

 

I think this feature may be required by another team at RBC who uses this production to support other applications. 

 

At this point, per my discussion with our security team, if the application uses Kerberos authentication, then this active session timeout is not required. If the application uses NTLM authentication, then active session timeout is needed. 

 

My question below is whether you can confirm if Stealth Audit software uses Kerberos authentication or not. If yes, is there a registration key or configure setting to prove that? If Kerberos is not turned on by default, can we turn it on? If Kerberos is not supported, then we have to go back to the active session timeout feature, and  we also like to know which version will support Kerberos since NTLM is outdated with vulnerabilities, even Microsoft plans to stop supporting this in the near future.

 

Thanks.

Hi Rick,

Can your Exchange Team also submit a ""risk acceptance"" exception until this feature is integrated into the NAA application?

Hi Rick,

We (Netwrix) have submitted a feature request for this functionality to meet your RBC request:

1) Your RBC request by your security team is to log users out of any application they are logged into for over 12 hrs (including NAA).

2) Your other RBC StealthAUDIT team (FS) submitted a ""risk acceptance"" exception until this feature is integrated into the NAA application.


Thank you,

I mean the active session timeout. The one in web-based application is inactive session timeout.

Hi Rick He,

There is no session timeout in the NAA application that is similar to the session timeout that you have in a web-based application.

For the product by default no, and from our last round of testing this, as long the customer isn't using the product for anything that requires NTLM such as targeting an IP address or using creds across an untrusted domain since both of those will both fall back to NTLM.

Hi Rick,

To the following question:
""Does NEA 11.6 use Kerberos authentication?""

ANSWER:
+++++
For the product by default no, and from our last round of testing this, as long the customer isn't using the product for anything that requires NTLM such as targeting an IP address or using creds across an untrusted domain since both of those will both fall back to NTLM.
+++++
