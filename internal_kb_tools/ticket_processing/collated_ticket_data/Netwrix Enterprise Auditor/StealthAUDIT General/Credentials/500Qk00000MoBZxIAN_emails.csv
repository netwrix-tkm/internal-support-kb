Hello,

I don't believe any changes were made to a connection profile. The only change I recall making was to reporting on one of the reports/jobs. That was to email it to me to try and see if that would work but I have reverted it.

Typically, I RDP into the server using my account and open the application which I assume will also be from my account. If I login to any of the other pieces of the application I will use my username.

Others have access to the server, but they would be using their account and not mine.

NEA successfully launches.

It is only my account that seems to have lots of recurring login failures. Like a couple every few seconds or so. So there are a lot of scripted logins that seem to be failing but I'm not sure why.

It happened even when I'm not logged into the server. So something in the application I'm guessing is causing it but I'm not sure where to look or how to find what it is. I rebooted the server and as soon as the server came online they started again.

It is only my account that seems to have lots of recurring login failures. Like a couple every few seconds or so. So there are a lot of scripted logins that seem to be failing but Iâ€™m not sure why. 

 

It happened even when Iâ€™m not logged into the server. So something in the application Iâ€™m guessing is causing it but Iâ€™m not sure where to look or how to find what it is. I rebooted the server and as soon as the server came online they started again.

Hello William,
 
Thank you for the update.

If you successfully launch the NEA application, the log will reveal nothing.

Do you remember to mistype your password when logging into the NEA server?
 
If the password was mistyped, that could send that information to the SIEM
 
Have you noticed any login failures other than yours?
 
 
Thanks

Hello, 

 

I donâ€™t believe any changes were made to a connection profile. The only change I recall making was to reporting on one of the reports/jobs. That was to email it to me to try and see if that would work but I have reverted it. 

 

Typically, I RDP into the server using my account and open the application which I assume will also be from my account. If I login to any of the other pieces of the application I will use my username. 

 

Others have access to the server, but they would be using their account and not mine. 

 

NEA successfully launches. 

 

The results of the command provided are as follows:

Hi William,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, in our investigation, we discovered one host in Activity Monitor with your user ID, and the password was not updated.
We updated the password, and you will monitor your SIEM for a failed login.
Please reply to this email to let me know if the issue is resolved.

Thanks,

It is only my account that seems to have lots of recurring login failures. Like a couple every few seconds or so. So there are a lot of scripted logins that seem to be failing but I'm not sure why.

It happened even when I'm not logged into the server. So something in the application I'm guessing is causing it but I'm not sure where to look or how to find what it is. I rebooted the server and as soon as the server came online they started again.
