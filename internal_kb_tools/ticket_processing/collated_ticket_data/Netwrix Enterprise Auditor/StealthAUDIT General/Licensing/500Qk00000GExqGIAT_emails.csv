Hi Mike,

 

They have signed their renewal quote and can use their regular license. Unless I’m missing something, you can likely close this case.

 

Thanks for your help.

Hi Ryan,

Here is the more verbose PowerShell script from Dusty (and I think Josh):

+++++
2024_0927: PowerShell script - ""Get-ADOrganizationalUnit"" counts and names - Josh and Dusty
+++++

#####
#####

# Get all Organizational Units
$OUs = Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter *

# Initialize an array to store the results
$results = @()

foreach ($OU in $OUs) {
    # Get the distinguished name of the OU
    $OUName = $OU.DistinguishedName

    # Count active users in the OU
    $activeUsers = Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $true} -SearchBase $OUName -SearchScope Subtree | Measure-Object | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Count

    # Count disabled users in the OU
    $disabledUsers = Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $false} -SearchBase $OUName -SearchScope Subtree | Measure-Object | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Count

    # Add the results to the array
    $results += [PSCustomObject]@{
        OUName        = $OUName
        ActiveUsers   = $activeUsers
        DisabledUsers = $disabledUsers
    }
}

# Output the results
$results | Format-Table -AutoSize

Hi Ryan,

The 2 smaller but useful PowerShell scripts are at the beginning of this email.
Then I included a summary of the meeting which I should have sent to you last week on 25-Sep-2024.
I will send the other more verbose PowerShell script from Dusty and Josh in a second email.

+++++
1) 2024_0927: PowerShell script from Dusty for ""get-aduser"" with output to TXT file
+++++

get-aduser -filter * -Properties * | where {$_.enabled -eq ""True""} | Sort-Object DistinguishedName | FT Name, DistinguishedName, Enabled -AutoSize | Tee-Object ""c:tempEnabled_AD_Users_per_OU_2024_0927.txt""

+++++
2) 2024_0927: Also a PowerShell Script from Dusty to ""get-aduser"" counts of Active, Inactive and Total AD Users
+++++

# +++++
# PowerShell ISE - need a server with AD Tools installed
# +++++

Clear-Host
##Import-Module ActiveDirectory
$enabled = (get-aduser -filter *|where {$_.enabled -eq ""True""}).count
Write-host ""Enabled users total =  $enabled"" -f green
$disabled = (get-aduser -filter *|where {$_.enabled -ne ""False""}).count
Write-host ""Disabled users total =  $disabled"" -f yellow
$TotalADCount = (get-aduser -Filter *).count
Write-host ""All users total = $TotalADCount"" -f red


#####
#####

+++++
2024_0927: Rough summary of the meeting today with Kevin Fraser and Ryan Tyson:
+++++

+++++
2024_0927: This ticket is mostly about obtaining/confirming AD-User  counts for the purpose of licensing with Sales and the customer renewing their licenses.
+++++
CASE SUBJECT: Live session required to review Sealthbits application compliance objects to review the count
+++++
Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago participants:
+++++
Kevin Fraser
Ryan Tyson
+++++
Dusty
Josh
 
+++++
When we count the AD objects - Exchange Help Mail boxes count as well.
+++++
Account Manager = Paul Staz
650 user count - licensed for this perhaps at this time???
+++++
Enabled users total = 926
Disabled user total = 207
TOTAL = 1133
+++++
Users = 1133
Groups = 1996
Computers = 1425
+++++
Best for NEA to look at the Report under 
Jobs  >> .Active Directory Inventory >> 1-AD_Scan > Active Directory Summary
+++++
I think some of the issue is that they are NEA users 
with Admin rights to the NEA server but are not Sysadmins. 
+++++

+++++
FROM Dusty:
+++++
If I recall:
1) NEA/AIC Licenses are based on Active user count.
2) SI Licenses are based on servers
3) SAM/NAM will use the NEA License
4) I'm pretty sure NEA is licensed by active user accounts, but that AD inventory includes all accounts. 
Licensing does count mailboxes and other non-user user accounts, but doesn't include disabled accounts
Would need to confirm with Sales.
+++++

Josh prior to the meeting: Perhaps Ryan is referring to the ""AD inventory summary count"" 
+++++

Thank you,
Mike Candon
