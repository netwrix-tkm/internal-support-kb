Hi Vimal,

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Hi Vimal,



 



After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.



 



To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.



 



Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.








 






Kind regards,



Shehzaad Khan

Hi Vimal,



 



After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.



 



To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.



 



Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Hi Vimal,

 

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

 

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Hi Vimal,

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Kind regards,

Hi Vimal,



 



After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.



 



To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.



 



Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.








 






Kind regards,



Shehzaad Khan

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Hi Vimal,

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Hi Vimal,



 



After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.



 



To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.



 



Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Hi Vimal,

 

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

 

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

 



Kind regards,

Hi Vimal,

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:

  *   Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
  *   Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
  *   Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
  *   Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On

The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.


Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan

Hi Vimal,



After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.



To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.



Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
*       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.


Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Hi Vimal,



Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:

·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

·       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On

The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.



The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.



The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.



Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.



Kind regards,

Shehzaad Khan

Hi Vimal,



After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.



To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.



Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.



In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
*       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan
Enterprise Account Manager

Vimal,

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
*       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan
Enterprise Account Manager

Vimal,

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Hi Vimal,

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Hi Pavel,

Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:


  *   Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
  *   Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
  *   Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don't end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.

@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Vimal

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
*       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan
Enterprise Account Manager

Vimal,

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Importance: High

Hi Pavel,

Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:


*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don't end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.

@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Regards
Vimal

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
*       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan
Enterprise Account Manager

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan

Hi Vimal,

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Importance: High



Hi Pavel,



Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:



·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows



Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don’t end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.



@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Hi Vimal,



Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

•       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On

The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.



The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.



The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.



Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.



Kind regards,

Shehzaad Khan

Vimal,

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,



After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.



To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.



Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.



Kind regards,

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don't end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.

@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Regards
Vimal

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
*       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan
Enterprise Account Manager

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Importance: High

Hi Pavel,

Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:


*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don't end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.

@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Regards
Vimal

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
*       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan
Enterprise Account Manager

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Hi Vimal,

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Kind regards,

Importance: High



Hi Pavel,



Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:



•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows



Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don’t end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.



@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Hi Vimal,



Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

•       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On

The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.



The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.



The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.



Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.



Kind regards,

Shehzaad Khan

Enterprise Account Manager

Hi Shehzaad,



I have not had any response from Pavel regarding my query. I need this resolving urgently. Can you get this escalated and get the license issue resolved by today? Otherwise, I will have to escalate this higher up the chain.

Hi Ilya,



I have CC’d in Pavel from the renewals team to help assist with this as there seems to be some confusion with the renewal of product.



@Pavel Tarabanov<mailto:Pavel.Tarabanov@netwrix.com>, can you please provide an update?

Vimal,

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,



After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.



To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.



Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.



Kind regards,

Shehzaad Khan

Hi Vimal,



Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.



In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Importance: High

Hi Pavel,

Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:


*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don't end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.

@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Regards
Vimal

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
*       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan
Enterprise Account Manager

Vimal,

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Importance: High



Hi Pavel,



Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:



•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows



Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don’t end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.



@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Vimal

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

•       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On

The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.



The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.



The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.



Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.



Kind regards,

Shehzaad Khan

Hi Shehzaad,



I have not had any response from Pavel regarding my query. I need this resolving urgently. Can you get this escalated and get the license issue resolved by today? Otherwise, I will have to escalate this higher up the chain.

Vimal,

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,



After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.



To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.



Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Hi Vimal,



Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.



In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Importance: High

 

Hi Pavel,

 

Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:

 

·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux 

·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

 

Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don’t end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.

 

@Shehzaad Khan, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

 

Regards
Vimal

Hi Vimal,

 

I am actually on annual leave for the rest of this week, can we scheduled a meeting for Monday next week? Alternatively, if you are happy to have this meeting without me, I will let Pavel come back with some times for a call tomorrow or Friday.

Hi Vimal,

 

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:

·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux 

·       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

·       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On

The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

 

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

 

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

 

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

 

Kind regards,

Shehzaad Khan

Hi Vimal,

 

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

 

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Importance: High

Hi Pavel,

Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:


*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don't end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.

@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Regards
Vimal

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
*       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan
Enterprise Account Manager

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:


•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don’t end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.

@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Regards
Vimal

I am happy to have a call with Pavel. It would be better to sort this out sooner rather than later.

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
•       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
•       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan
Enterprise Account Manager

Vimal,

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Apologize for the delay, I am still waiting for a response from support on this.

In the meantime, I have issued a trial license key for you to use in the meantime to assure there is no downtime within your environment. Please can you use this license key whilst we sort out the internal issues with your production license key.

Hi Shehzaad

Further to our discussion last week, is there any update on updating software and going through system review? Also need the new license file until we finalise on pricing for additional licenses.

Importance: High

Hi Pavel,

Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:


*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don't end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.

@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Regards
Vimal

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
*       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan
Enterprise Account Manager

Hi Shehzaad,

I have not had any response from Pavel regarding my query. I need this resolving urgently. Can you get this escalated and get the license issue resolved by today? Otherwise, I will have to escalate this higher up the chain.

Hi Ilya,

I have CC'd in Pavel from the renewals team to help assist with this as there seems to be some confusion with the renewal of product.

@Pavel Tarabanov<mailto:Pavel.Tarabanov@netwrix.com>, can you please provide an update?

Kind regards,

Vimal,

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Kind regards,

Hi Shehzaad

Further to our discussion last week, is there any update on updating software and going through system review? Also need the new license file until we finalise on pricing for additional licenses.

Importance: High

Hi Pavel,

Further to our conversation last Friday, have you managed to arrange a call with Pre-Sales team and Shehzaad to discuss licensing requirement for below products:


*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux

*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows

Currently we have been provided temporary license until 17th July. I am getting little worried and don't end up in a position where we are not able to access Stealth Audit after this date and fail to provide audits for our monthly reports. Could this please be treated with some urgency and seriousness.

@Shehzaad Khan<mailto:shehzaad.khan@netwrix.com>, can we get to the bottom of this? Too many emails and cross communication going on. Call me if you need to discuss.

Regards
Vimal

Hi Vimal,

Sorry for the confusion here but just to give you some update on what Pavel has stated, you currently have the following modules with us:
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Unix and Linux
*       Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for Windows
*       Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On
The renewal that occurred in January was for the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On which is currently active until 04/01/2025.

The Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD, Windows and Unix and Linux have a different mainteince contract date to the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On and these base modules have expired as their contract date was 13/06/2024.

The reason your license key is inactive is because it requires a valid base license contract. Even though the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Add-On is active with a current maintenance contract, it still needs an active base contract to function properly.

Please let me or Pavel know if you have any questions regarding the above. Happy to jump on a call to discuss this further.

Kind regards,
Shehzaad Khan
Enterprise Account Manager

Vimal,

Then we will have to wait for your Account Manager, unfortunately.

I'm sorry that it takes so long.

Shehzaad,

Smurfit Kappa Nederland BV already have a license, can we please provide them with the file?

Hi Vimal,

After an internal investigation, I have found that the license key for your Netwrix Enterprise Auditor base subscription has expired on 13/06/2024.

To help resolve this issue, I have involved my colleagues Iliya and Pavel from our renewals team. They will be able to assist you in renewing your license key.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Kind regards,
