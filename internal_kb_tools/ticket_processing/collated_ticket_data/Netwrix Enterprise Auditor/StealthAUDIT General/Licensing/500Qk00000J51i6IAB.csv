We have a customer who was presented with 3 products :

1) Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
2) Netwrix Threat Manager

The main question regarding the licensing model is how it is charged ? ( is it per active AD user ?)
Second question : Does the above 2 products work together ? ( with migration etc)
Third question : I suppose that this customer can buy for example Threat Manager without Enterprise Auditor , correct?
Forth question : Does Threat Manager works with agent?

Thank you.



Kind regards,
Panagiotis Tsampas","","","","Account management is in contact with the customer.
