2024_0927: Rough summary of your meeting today with Kevin Fraser and Ryan Tyson:
+++++

+++++
2024_0927: This ticket is mostly about obtaining/confirming AD-User  counts for the purpose of licensing with Sales and the customer renewing their licenses.
+++++
CASE SUBJECT: Live session required to review Sealthbits application compliance objects to review the count
+++++
Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago participants:
+++++
Kevin Fraser
Ryan Tyson
+++++
Dusty
Josh
 

+++++
When we count the AD objects - Exchange Help Mail boxes count as well.
+++++
Account Manager = Paul Staz
650 user count - licensed for this perhaps at this time???
+++++
Enabled users total = 926
Disabled user total = 207
TOTAL = 1133
+++++
Users = 1133
Groups = 1996
Computers = 1425
+++++
Best for NEA to look at the Report under 
Jobs  >> .Active Directory Inventory >> 1-AD_Scan > Active Directory Summary
+++++
I think some of the issue is that they are NEA users 
with Admin rights to the NEA server but are not Sysadmins. 
+++++

+++++
FROM Dusty:
+++++
If I recall:
1) NEA/AIC Licenses are based on Active user count.
2) SI Licenses are based on servers
3) SAM/NAM will use the NEA Lic.
4) I'm pretty sure NEA is licensed by active user accounts, but that AD inventory includes all accounts. 
Licensing does count mailboxes and other non-user user accounts, but doesn't include disabled accounts
Would need to confirm with Sales.

Josh prior to the meeting: Perhaps Ryan is referring to the ""AD inventory summary count""
