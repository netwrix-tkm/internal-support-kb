Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

I've checked the notes and the Feature Request mentioned is to be considered in the next version upgrade. That aside, no updates on that front, unfortunately. I've looked but haven't seen much of such scenarios. Maybe if you could explain what exactly is the setup and why migration of data is necessary, I could attempt to find a solution?

Thanks Ilya..

The details are exactly the same as the previous ticket. Basically we moving away from the netapp filer to a windows file server. (windows server with shares on it)

We have been copying the data off the nettap file server to the windows file server and will be going live next month. The idea is how do we re-link auditor to the new file server. The new file server will have the same name as the old one.

In this case, since the Feature Request is still not realized, it would be easier for you to add and re-scan the new server separately. Is that not desirable for some reason?

Thanks Ilya..

 

The details are exactly the same as the previous ticket. Basically we moving away from the netapp filer to a windows file server. (windows server with shares on it)

 

We have been copying the data off the nettap file server to the windows file server and will be going live next month. The idea is how do we re-link auditor to the new file server. The new file server will have the same name as the old one.

Hello Warren,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

I've checked the notes and the Feature Request mentioned is to be considered in the next version upgrade. That aside, no updates on that front, unfortunately. I've looked but haven't seen much of such scenarios. Maybe if you could explain what exactly is the setup and why migration of data is necessary, I could attempt to find a solution?

From my findings, it's unlikely that you will be able to fully migrate the data, since the intake source is different. While, technically, possible, we are unaware of possible issues that this may cause, so we advice to perform the clean setup. To avoid duplicate data I suggest removing old data, then doing a new setup for new file server type.

Is there anything else I could help you with?

If that is the only solution then I guess I would have to. 

 


	I didnâ€™t want to duplicate data in the database
	How could I preserve my resource owners as to not re-setup all the resources and owners

Thanks Ilya..

 

The details are exactly the same as the previous ticket. Basically we moving away from the netapp filer to a windows file server. (windows server with shares on it)

 

We have been copying the data off the nettap file server to the windows file server and will be going live next month. The idea is how do we re-link auditor to the new file server. The new file server will have the same name as the old one.

 

Regards

Warren

Hello Warren,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

I've checked the notes and the Feature Request mentioned is to be considered in the next version upgrade. That aside, no updates on that front, unfortunately. I've looked but haven't seen much of such scenarios. Maybe if you could explain what exactly is the setup and why migration of data is necessary, I could attempt to find a solution?

Thank you. I would prefer to be on the safe side. Is there any way I can keep my activity details data that I can query from the database... Perhaps a new database or something.. also what can I do to maintain my resources  owners intact. Without having to re-add them

Same story with the ownership, it's structured data relating to the specific, existing objects in the DB. Since you're changing the objects, you will have to set ownership anew. I wish I could help with this scenario, but, unfortunately, there's just no 100% tested and safe way of exporting data between the collectors.

Thanks Ilya..

 

The details are exactly the same as the previous ticket. Basically we moving away from the netapp filer to a windows file server. (windows server with shares on it)

 

We have been copying the data off the nettap file server to the windows file server and will be going live next month. The idea is how do we re-link auditor to the new file server. The new file server will have the same name as the old one.

 

Regards

Warren

Hello Warren,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

I've checked the notes and the Feature Request mentioned is to be considered in the next version upgrade. That aside, no updates on that front, unfortunately. I've looked but haven't seen much of such scenarios. Maybe if you could explain what exactly is the setup and why migration of data is necessary, I could attempt to find a solution?


Best wishes,

Warren,

Same story with the ownership, it's structured data relating to the specific, existing objects in the DB. Since you're changing the objects, you will have to set ownership anew. I wish I could help with this scenario, but, unfortunately, there's just no 100% tested and safe way of exporting data between the collectors.

Thank you. I would prefer to be on the safe side. Is there any way I can keep my activity details data that I can query from the database... Perhaps a new database or something.. also what can I do to maintain my resources  owners intact. Without having to re-add them

Warren,

From my findings, it's unlikely that you will be able to fully migrate the data, since the intake source is different. While, technically, possible, we are unaware of possible issues that this may cause, so we advice to perform the clean setup. To avoid duplicate data I suggest removing old data, then doing a new setup for new file server type.

Is there anything else I could help you with?

Thanks,

Theres one more thing you can help me with. I will be making a copy of the SQL database before removing the old host and adding the new host.

Can your development team provide me with a SQL script to view activity detail by share or able to tell me which tables I can look at to view activity data for the host.

I am thinking of creating a Powerbi dashboard to connect to the old database in case I need to provide the business with any activity detail reports.

Hello Warren,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

I've checked the notes and the Feature Request mentioned is to be considered in the next version upgrade. That aside, no updates on that front, unfortunately. I've looked but haven't seen much of such scenarios. Maybe if you could explain what exactly is the setup and why migration of data is necessary, I could attempt to find a solution?

Thanks,

 

Theres one more thing you can help me with. I will be making a copy of the SQL database before removing the old host and adding the new host.

 

Can your development team provide me with a SQL script to view activity detail by share or able to tell me which tables I can look at to view activity data for the host.

 

I am thinking of creating a Powerbi dashboard to connect to the old database in case I need to provide the business with any activity detail reports.

 

Regards

Warren

Warren,

Same story with the ownership, it's structured data relating to the specific, existing objects in the DB. Since you're changing the objects, you will have to set ownership anew. I wish I could help with this scenario, but, unfortunately, there's just no 100% tested and safe way of exporting data between the collectors.

Thank you. I would prefer to be on the safe side. Is there any way I can keep my activity details data that I can query from the database... Perhaps a new database or something.. also what can I do to maintain my resources  owners intact. Without having to re-add them

Warren,

From my findings, it's unlikely that you will be able to fully migrate the data, since the intake source is different. While, technically, possible, we are unaware of possible issues that this may cause, so we advice to perform the clean setup. To avoid duplicate data I suggest removing old data, then doing a new setup for new file server type.

Is there anything else I could help you with?

If that is the only solution then I guess I would have to. 

 


	I didnâ€™t want to duplicate data in the database
	How could I preserve my resource owners as to not re-setup all the resources and owners

Warren,

In this case, since the Feature Request is still not realized, it would be easier for you to add and re-scan the new server separately. Is that not desirable for some reason?

Thanks Ilya..

 

The details are exactly the same as the previous ticket. Basically we moving away from the netapp filer to a windows file server. (windows server with shares on it)

 

We have been copying the data off the nettap file server to the windows file server and will be going live next month. The idea is how do we re-link auditor to the new file server. The new file server will have the same name as the old one.

 

Regards

Warren

Hello Warren,

As per their response:

Here's a comprehensive list of all tables and views used by File Server collector (which is also responsible for cokkecting NetApp data): https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/StandardTables.htm

Please use it to migrate the data you might need for future reference/analysis. A good starting point would be SA_FSAC_DailyResourceActivityView.

If that is the only solution then I guess I would have to. 

 


	I didnâ€™t want to duplicate data in the database
	How could I preserve my resource owners as to not re-setup all the resources and owners

Warren,

In this case, since the Feature Request is still not realized, it would be easier for you to add and re-scan the new server separately. Is that not desirable for some reason?

Thanks Ilya..

 

The details are exactly the same as the previous ticket. Basically we moving away from the netapp filer to a windows file server. (windows server with shares on it)

 

We have been copying the data off the nettap file server to the windows file server and will be going live next month. The idea is how do we re-link auditor to the new file server. The new file server will have the same name as the old one.

 

Regards

Warren

Hello Warren,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

I've checked the notes and the Feature Request mentioned is to be considered in the next version upgrade. That aside, no updates on that front, unfortunately. I've looked but haven't seen much of such scenarios. Maybe if you could explain what exactly is the setup and why migration of data is necessary, I could attempt to find a solution?

Warren,

As per their response:

Here's a comprehensive list of all tables and views used by File Server collector (which is also responsible for cokkecting NetApp data): https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/StandardTables.htm

Please use it to migrate the data you might need for future reference/analysis. A good starting point would be SA_FSAC_DailyResourceActivityView.

Thanks,

 

Theres one more thing you can help me with. I will be making a copy of the SQL database before removing the old host and adding the new host.

 

Can your development team provide me with a SQL script to view activity detail by share or able to tell me which tables I can look at to view activity data for the host.

 

I am thinking of creating a Powerbi dashboard to connect to the old database in case I need to provide the business with any activity detail reports.

Warren,

Same story with the ownership, it's structured data relating to the specific, existing objects in the DB. Since you're changing the objects, you will have to set ownership anew. I wish I could help with this scenario, but, unfortunately, there's just no 100% tested and safe way of exporting data between the collectors.

Thank you. I would prefer to be on the safe side. Is there any way I can keep my activity details data that I can query from the database... Perhaps a new database or something.. also what can I do to maintain my resources  owners intact. Without having to re-add them

Warren,

From my findings, it's unlikely that you will be able to fully migrate the data, since the intake source is different. While, technically, possible, we are unaware of possible issues that this may cause, so we advice to perform the clean setup. To avoid duplicate data I suggest removing old data, then doing a new setup for new file server type.

Is there anything else I could help you with?

Warren,

Same story with the ownership, it's structured data relating to the specific, existing objects in the DB. Since you're changing the objects, you will have to set ownership anew. I wish I could help with this scenario, but, unfortunately, there's just no 100% tested and safe way of exporting data between the collectors.

Thank you. I would prefer to be on the safe side. Is there any way I can keep my activity details data that I can query from the database... Perhaps a new database or something.. also what can I do to maintain my resources  owners intact. Without having to re-add them

Warren,

From my findings, it's unlikely that you will be able to fully migrate the data, since the intake source is different. While, technically, possible, we are unaware of possible issues that this may cause, so we advice to perform the clean setup. To avoid duplicate data I suggest removing old data, then doing a new setup for new file server type.

Is there anything else I could help you with?

Warren,

In this case, since the Feature Request is still not realized, it would be easier for you to add and re-scan the new server separately. Is that not desirable for some reason?

Thanks Ilya..

 

The details are exactly the same as the previous ticket. Basically we moving away from the netapp filer to a windows file server. (windows server with shares on it)

 

We have been copying the data off the nettap file server to the windows file server and will be going live next month. The idea is how do we re-link auditor to the new file server. The new file server will have the same name as the old one.

 

Regards

Warren

Hello Warren,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

I've checked the notes and the Feature Request mentioned is to be considered in the next version upgrade. That aside, no updates on that front, unfortunately. I've looked but haven't seen much of such scenarios. Maybe if you could explain what exactly is the setup and why migration of data is necessary, I could attempt to find a solution?

Warren,

As per their response:

Here's a comprehensive list of all tables and views used by File Server collector (which is also responsible for cokkecting NetApp data): https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/StandardTables.htm<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/StandardTables.htm>

Please use it to migrate the data you might need for future reference/analysis. A good starting point would be SA_FSAC_DailyResourceActivityView.

Thanks,

Theres one more thing you can help me with. I will be making a copy of the SQL database before removing the old host and adding the new host.

Can your development team provide me with a SQL script to view activity detail by share or able to tell me which tables I can look at to view activity data for the host.

I am thinking of creating a Powerbi dashboard to connect to the old database in case I need to provide the business with any activity detail reports.

Regards
Warren

Warren,

In this case, since the Feature Request is still not realized, it would be easier for you to add and re-scan the new server separately. Is that not desirable for some reason?

Thanks Ilya..



The details are exactly the same as the previous ticket. Basically we moving away from the netapp filer to a windows file server. (windows server with shares on it)



We have been copying the data off the nettap file server to the windows file server and will be going live next month. The idea is how do we re-link auditor to the new file server. The new file server will have the same name as the old one.

Warren

Hello Warren,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

I've checked the notes and the Feature Request mentioned is to be considered in the next version upgrade. That aside, no updates on that front, unfortunately. I've looked but haven't seen much of such scenarios. Maybe if you could explain what exactly is the setup and why migration of data is necessary, I could attempt to find a solution?

Warren,

As per their response:

Here's a comprehensive list of all tables and views used by File Server collector (which is also responsible for cokkecting NetApp data): https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/StandardTables.htm

Please use it to migrate the data you might need for future reference/analysis. A good starting point would be SA_FSAC_DailyResourceActivityView.

Thanks,

 

Theres one more thing you can help me with. I will be making a copy of the SQL database before removing the old host and adding the new host.

 

Can your development team provide me with a SQL script to view activity detail by share or able to tell me which tables I can look at to view activity data for the host.

 

I am thinking of creating a Powerbi dashboard to connect to the old database in case I need to provide the business with any activity detail reports.

 

Regards

Warren

Warren,

Same story with the ownership, it's structured data relating to the specific, existing objects in the DB. Since you're changing the objects, you will have to set ownership anew. I wish I could help with this scenario, but, unfortunately, there's just no 100% tested and safe way of exporting data between the collectors.

Thank you. I would prefer to be on the safe side. Is there any way I can keep my activity details data that I can query from the database... Perhaps a new database or something.. also what can I do to maintain my resources  owners intact. Without having to re-add them

Warren,

From my findings, it's unlikely that you will be able to fully migrate the data, since the intake source is different. While, technically, possible, we are unaware of possible issues that this may cause, so we advice to perform the clean setup. To avoid duplicate data I suggest removing old data, then doing a new setup for new file server type.

Is there anything else I could help you with?

If that is the only solution then I guess I would have to. 

 


	I didnâ€™t want to duplicate data in the database
	How could I preserve my resource owners as to not re-setup all the resources and owners

As per their response:

Here's a comprehensive list of all tables and views used by File Server collector (which is also responsible for cokkecting NetApp data): https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/StandardTables.htm

Please use it to migrate the data you might need for future reference/analysis. A good starting point would be SA_FSAC_DailyResourceActivityView.

Thanks,

 

Theres one more thing you can help me with. I will be making a copy of the SQL database before removing the old host and adding the new host.

 

Can your development team provide me with a SQL script to view activity detail by share or able to tell me which tables I can look at to view activity data for the host.

 

I am thinking of creating a Powerbi dashboard to connect to the old database in case I need to provide the business with any activity detail reports.

 

Regards

Warren

Warren,

Same story with the ownership, it's structured data relating to the specific, existing objects in the DB. Since you're changing the objects, you will have to set ownership anew. I wish I could help with this scenario, but, unfortunately, there's just no 100% tested and safe way of exporting data between the collectors.

Thank you. I would prefer to be on the safe side. Is there any way I can keep my activity details data that I can query from the database... Perhaps a new database or something.. also what can I do to maintain my resources  owners intact. Without having to re-add them

Warren,

From my findings, it's unlikely that you will be able to fully migrate the data, since the intake source is different. While, technically, possible, we are unaware of possible issues that this may cause, so we advice to perform the clean setup. To avoid duplicate data I suggest removing old data, then doing a new setup for new file server type.

Is there anything else I could help you with?

If that is the only solution then I guess I would have to. 

 


	I didnâ€™t want to duplicate data in the database
	How could I preserve my resource owners as to not re-setup all the resources and owners

Warren,

In this case, since the Feature Request is still not realized, it would be easier for you to add and re-scan the new server separately. Is that not desirable for some reason?

Thanks Ilya..

 

The details are exactly the same as the previous ticket. Basically we moving away from the netapp filer to a windows file server. (windows server with shares on it)

 

We have been copying the data off the nettap file server to the windows file server and will be going live next month. The idea is how do we re-link auditor to the new file server. The new file server will have the same name as the old one.

 

Regards

Warren

Hello Warren,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

I've checked the notes and the Feature Request mentioned is to be considered in the next version upgrade. That aside, no updates on that front, unfortunately. I've looked but haven't seen much of such scenarios. Maybe if you could explain what exactly is the setup and why migration of data is necessary, I could attempt to find a solution?

Please use it to migrate the data you might need for future reference/analysis. A good starting point would be SA_FSAC_DailyResourceActivityView.

Thanks,

Theres one more thing you can help me with. I will be making a copy of the SQL database before removing the old host and adding the new host.

Can your development team provide me with a SQL script to view activity detail by share or able to tell me which tables I can look at to view activity data for the host.

I am thinking of creating a Powerbi dashboard to connect to the old database in case I need to provide the business with any activity detail reports.

Regards
Warren

Warren,

Same story with the ownership, it's structured data relating to the specific, existing objects in the DB. Since you're changing the objects, you will have to set ownership anew. I wish I could help with this scenario, but, unfortunately, there's just no 100% tested and safe way of exporting data between the collectors.

Thank you. I would prefer to be on the safe side. Is there any way I can keep my activity details data that I can query from the database... Perhaps a new database or something.. also what can I do to maintain my resources  owners intact. Without having to re-add them

Warren,

From my findings, it's unlikely that you will be able to fully migrate the data, since the intake source is different. While, technically, possible, we are unaware of possible issues that this may cause, so we advice to perform the clean setup. To avoid duplicate data I suggest removing old data, then doing a new setup for new file server type.

Is there anything else I could help you with?

If that is the only solution then I guess I would have to.



  1.  I didnâ€™t want to duplicate data in the database
  2.  How could I preserve my resource owners as to not re-setup all the resources and owners



Regards

Warren

Warren,

In this case, since the Feature Request is still not realized, it would be easier for you to add and re-scan the new server separately. Is that not desirable for some reason?

Thanks Ilya..



The details are exactly the same as the previous ticket. Basically we moving away from the netapp filer to a windows file server. (windows server with shares on it)



We have been copying the data off the nettap file server to the windows file server and will be going live next month. The idea is how do we re-link auditor to the new file server. The new file server will have the same name as the old one.



Regards

Warren

Hello Warren,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

I've checked the notes and the Feature Request mentioned is to be considered in the next version upgrade. That aside, no updates on that front, unfortunately. I've looked but haven't seen much of such scenarios. Maybe if you could explain what exactly is the setup and why migration of data is necessary, I could attempt to find a solution?
