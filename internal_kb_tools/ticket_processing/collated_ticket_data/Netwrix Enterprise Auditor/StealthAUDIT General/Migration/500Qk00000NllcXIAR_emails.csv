This is Artem, with a separate ticket for tracking progress of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application database migration.
The following is a recap of our today`s meeting and details related to Enterprise Auditor database migration:

After confirming successful restoration of NEA database on a new SQL server we attempted to change the storage profile in the Enterprise Auditor console.
However, we faced the following error:
""remote server refused connection""

To check if this issue is caused due to SQL server port been blocked we did the following:

1. We checked the SQL server settings with DBA team and confirmed that server is configured to accept connections on port 1433.
2. We also performed Test-NetConnection command from Enterprise Auditor against new SQL server on port 1433 - test net connection was a success.

We then created a .udl file and attempted connection to SQL server directly outside of Enterprise Auditor and faced the same error as well as an error related to SSL/TLS connection issue.
However, .udl test was successful when we tried connecting to the old SQL Server from Enterprise Auditor server.

We also tried disabling TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 types for Enterprise Auditor server to see if this resolves the issue - result was the same error in the .udl test.

As of now the .udl test is not successful. We agreed that you will engage DBA and networking team to resolve the .udl test issues.
Once you can confirm that .udl connection test is successful from Enterprise Auditor to new SQL server - then you can proceed with updating Enterprise Auditor storage profile and configure it to connect to a new SQL server.

Please, let me know once you have results or if you have any additional questions.
Looking forward to your reply. Thank you, Vinay!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Artem,
Good Day!

SQL team has resolved the issue by installing required OLE DB provider 19 and DB connectivity is working fine.

I request to schedule a call to do the validation together once again before we plan for DB migration.

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.
The following is a recap of this meeting:

We installed OleDB 18 Provider on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server.
After this connection to new SQL server via .udl file was successful for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account using Windows Authentication. 

We then tested the same connection via Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console - connection was successful but we could not get the list of available databases due to missing VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission on the 'master' db.
For testing purposes the VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission was provided for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account.

After this we opened Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console using ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account and tested connection to new SQL server again - it was successful and there was no issue with getting list of available databases.

This confirms that Netwrix Enterprise Auditor as well as ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account are ready for migration to a new SQL server.

Please, let me know once you have exact time window to apply this change. For now I have added a placeholder meeting for Wednesday, 23rd of April, at 12:00 noon GMT +4 (01:30 PM IST).

Happy holidays Vinay! I am looking forward to hearing back from you.

I just wanted to send a follow up to you about our ticket for Enterprise Auditor database migration.

Last time me you and a member of your DBA team discussed migration and verified that new SQL server is ready for migrating StealthAudit database.
As such, do you have the exact time when are you planning to migrate database? Is this change planned for tomorrow, 23rd of April?

Looking forward to your reply.

Hi Vinay,

I just wanted to send a follow up to you about our ticket for Enterprise Auditor database migration.

Last time me you and a member of your DBA team discussed migration and verified that new SQL server is ready for migrating StealthAudit database.
As such, do you have the exact time when are you planning to migrate database? Is this change planned for tomorrow, 23rd of April?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Vinay,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.
The following is a recap of this meeting:

We installed OleDB 18 Provider on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server.
After this connection to new SQL server via .udl file was successful for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account using Windows Authentication.

We then tested the same connection via Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console - connection was successful but we could not get the list of available databases due to missing VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission on the 'master' db.
For testing purposes the VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission was provided for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account.

After this we opened Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console using ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account and tested connection to new SQL server again - it was successful and there was no issue with getting list of available databases.

This confirms that Netwrix Enterprise Auditor as well as ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account are ready for migration to a new SQL server.

Please, let me know once you have exact time window to apply this change. For now I have added a placeholder meeting for Wednesday, 23rd of April, at 12:00 noon GMT +4 (01:30 PM IST).

Happy holidays Vinay! I am looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Vinay,

I just wanted to send a follow up to you about our ticket for Enterprise Auditor database migration.

Last time me you and a member of your DBA team discussed migration and verified that new SQL server is ready for migrating StealthAudit database.
As such, do you have the exact time when are you planning to migrate database? Is this change planned for tomorrow, 23rd of April?

Looking forward to your reply.

Hello Vinay,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.
The following is a recap of this meeting:

We installed OleDB 18 Provider on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server.
After this connection to new SQL server via .udl file was successful for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account using Windows Authentication.

We then tested the same connection via Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console - connection was successful but we could not get the list of available databases due to missing VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission on the 'master' db.
For testing purposes the VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission was provided for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account.

After this we opened Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console using ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account and tested connection to new SQL server again - it was successful and there was no issue with getting list of available databases.

This confirms that Netwrix Enterprise Auditor as well as ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account are ready for migration to a new SQL server.

Please, let me know once you have exact time window to apply this change. For now I have added a placeholder meeting for Wednesday, 23rd of April, at 12:00 noon GMT +4 (01:30 PM IST).

Happy holidays Vinay! I am looking forward to hearing back from you.

Hello Artem,
Good Day!

SQL team has resolved the issue by installing required OLE DB provider 19 and DB connectivity is working fine.

I request to schedule a call to do the validation together once again before we plan for DB migration.

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
The following is a recap of what was done:

After updating the Storage profile for the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) we confirmed successful connection to Published Reports.
However, Access Information Center web page could not be secured. As such, we have updated certificate binding for port 481 (AIC service port on your server) using latest certificate.

As a result we were able to open secure connection to AIC, but we were presented with another issue - AIC was still trying to connect to old SQL db.
According to information from this helpcenter article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Database.htm
AIC SQL db connection can be changed either during installation, or after logging into AIC.

Since we were unable to login into AIC (because original StealthAudit DB is in read-only mode) - we uninstalled and installed AIC version 11.6.0.37.
During installation we provided connection information for a new SQL DB.
We also noticed that DB connection using UPN format times out. As such, we switched to NetBIOS name format (domainuser) for the service log on settings and connection was successful as confirmed by DBA. 
After installing new AIC we changed AIC exe config file and provided ""https"" value in the site binding parameter instead of ""http"". Current AIC exe config should have a binding for ""https"" on port 481.

As of now AIC is running an indexing script against StealthAudit db on a new SQL server. We agreed to leave it running for 30-60 minutes, then check results.
Please, let me know once you have results

Thank you!

Artem Naskal

Hi Vinay,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
The following is a recap of what was done:

After updating the Storage profile for the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) we confirmed successful connection to Published Reports.
However, Access Information Center web page could not be secured. As such, we have updated certificate binding for port 481 (AIC service port on your server) using latest certificate.

As a result we were able to open secure connection to AIC, but we were presented with another issue - AIC was still trying to connect to old SQL db.
According to information from this helpcenter article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Database.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Database.htm__;!!B1IJoQ!JtLRctibpXHiG0fIezu2iww9joNx5U_0Lp1bnpRZ-tsKuTPYaSq3C7oaOOqpimpdPHepQTLsV64muUY1OncLhw4$>
AIC SQL db connection can be changed either during installation, or after logging into AIC.

Since we were unable to login into AIC (because original StealthAudit DB is in read-only mode) - we uninstalled and installed AIC version 11.6.0.37.
During installation we provided connection information for a new SQL DB.
We also noticed that DB connection using UPN format times out. As such, we switched to NetBIOS name format (domainuser) for the service log on settings and connection was successful as confirmed by DBA.
After installing new AIC we changed AIC exe config file and provided ""https"" value in the site binding parameter instead of ""http"". Current AIC exe config should have a binding for ""https"" on port 481.

As of now AIC is running an indexing script against StealthAudit db on a new SQL server. We agreed to leave it running for 30-60 minutes, then check results.
Please, let me know once you have results

Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Vinay,

I just wanted to send a follow up to you about our ticket for Enterprise Auditor database migration.

Last time me you and a member of your DBA team discussed migration and verified that new SQL server is ready for migrating StealthAudit database.
As such, do you have the exact time when are you planning to migrate database? Is this change planned for tomorrow, 23rd of April?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Vinay,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.
The following is a recap of this meeting:

We installed OleDB 18 Provider on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server.
After this connection to new SQL server via .udl file was successful for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account using Windows Authentication.

We then tested the same connection via Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console - connection was successful but we could not get the list of available databases due to missing VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission on the 'master' db.
For testing purposes the VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission was provided for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account.

After this we opened Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console using ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account and tested connection to new SQL server again - it was successful and there was no issue with getting list of available databases.

This confirms that Netwrix Enterprise Auditor as well as ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account are ready for migration to a new SQL server.

Please, let me know once you have exact time window to apply this change. For now I have added a placeholder meeting for Wednesday, 23rd of April, at 12:00 noon GMT +4 (01:30 PM IST).

Happy holidays Vinay! I am looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Vinay,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
The following is a recap of what was done:

After updating the Storage profile for the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) we confirmed successful connection to Published Reports.
However, Access Information Center web page could not be secured. As such, we have updated certificate binding for port 481 (AIC service port on your server) using latest certificate.

As a result we were able to open secure connection to AIC, but we were presented with another issue - AIC was still trying to connect to old SQL db.
According to information from this helpcenter article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Database.htm
AIC SQL db connection can be changed either during installation, or after logging into AIC.

Since we were unable to login into AIC (because original StealthAudit DB is in read-only mode) - we uninstalled and installed AIC version 11.6.0.37.
During installation we provided connection information for a new SQL DB.
We also noticed that DB connection using UPN format times out. As such, we switched to NetBIOS name format (domainuser) for the service log on settings and connection was successful as confirmed by DBA. 
After installing new AIC we changed AIC exe config file and provided ""https"" value in the site binding parameter instead of ""http"". Current AIC exe config should have a binding for ""https"" on port 481.

As of now AIC is running an indexing script against StealthAudit db on a new SQL server. We agreed to leave it running for 30-60 minutes, then check results.
Please, let me know once you have results

Thank you!

Hi Vinay, 

I just wanted to send a follow up to you about our ticket for Enterprise Auditor database migration.

Last time me you and a member of your DBA team discussed migration and verified that new SQL server is ready for migrating StealthAudit database.
As such, do you have the exact time when are you planning to migrate database? Is this change planned for tomorrow, 23rd of April?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Vinay,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.
The following is a recap of this meeting:

We installed OleDB 18 Provider on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server.
After this connection to new SQL server via .udl file was successful for  ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account using Windows Authentication. 

We then tested the same connection via Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console - connection was successful but we could not get the list of available databases due to missing VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission on the 'master' db.
For testing purposes the VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission was provided for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account.

After this we opened Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console using ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account and tested connection to new SQL server again - it was successful and there was no issue with getting list of available databases.

This confirms that Netwrix Enterprise Auditor as well as ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account are ready for migration to a new SQL server.

Please, let me know once you have exact time window to apply this change. For now I have added a placeholder meeting for Wednesday, 23rd of April, at 12:00 noon GMT +4 (01:30 PM IST).

Happy holidays Vinay! I am looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Artem,

Good Day!

 

SQL team has resolved the issue by installing required OLE DB provider 19 and DB connectivity is working fine. 

 

I request to schedule a call to do the validation together once again before we plan for DB migration.

Hi Vinay,

I just wanted to send a follow up to you about our ticket for Enterprise Auditor database migration.

Last time me you and a member of your DBA team discussed migration and verified that new SQL server is ready for migrating StealthAudit database.
As such, do you have the exact time when are you planning to migrate database? Is this change planned for tomorrow, 23rd of April?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Vinay,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.
The following is a recap of this meeting:

We installed OleDB 18 Provider on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server.
After this connection to new SQL server via .udl file was successful for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account using Windows Authentication.

We then tested the same connection via Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console - connection was successful but we could not get the list of available databases due to missing VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission on the 'master' db.
For testing purposes the VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission was provided for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account.

After this we opened Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console using ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account and tested connection to new SQL server again - it was successful and there was no issue with getting list of available databases.

This confirms that Netwrix Enterprise Auditor as well as ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account are ready for migration to a new SQL server.

Please, let me know once you have exact time window to apply this change. For now I have added a placeholder meeting for Wednesday, 23rd of April, at 12:00 noon GMT +4 (01:30 PM IST).

Happy holidays Vinay! I am looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Artem,
Good Day!

SQL team has resolved the issue by installing required OLE DB provider 19 and DB connectivity is working fine.

I request to schedule a call to do the validation together once again before we plan for DB migration.

Hi Vinay,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
The following is a recap of what was done:

After updating the Storage profile for the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) we confirmed successful connection to Published Reports.
However, Access Information Center web page could not be secured. As such, we have updated certificate binding for port 481 (AIC service port on your server) using latest certificate.

As a result we were able to open secure connection to AIC, but we were presented with another issue - AIC was still trying to connect to old SQL db.
According to information from this helpcenter article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Database.htm
AIC SQL db connection can be changed either during installation, or after logging into AIC.

Since we were unable to login into AIC (because original StealthAudit DB is in read-only mode) - we uninstalled and installed AIC version 11.6.0.37.
During installation we provided connection information for a new SQL DB.
We also noticed that DB connection using UPN format times out. As such, we switched to NetBIOS name format (domainuser) for the service log on settings and connection was successful as confirmed by DBA. 
After installing new AIC we changed AIC exe config file and provided ""https"" value in the site binding parameter instead of ""http"". Current AIC exe config should have a binding for ""https"" on port 481.

As of now AIC is running an indexing script against StealthAudit db on a new SQL server. We agreed to leave it running for 30-60 minutes, then check results.
Please, let me know once you have results

Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Vinay, 

I just wanted to send a follow up to you about our ticket for Enterprise Auditor database migration.

Last time me you and a member of your DBA team discussed migration and verified that new SQL server is ready for migrating StealthAudit database.
As such, do you have the exact time when are you planning to migrate database? Is this change planned for tomorrow, 23rd of April?

Looking forward to your reply.

Once again thank you for finding time for this meeting.
The following is a recap of what was done:

After increasing timeout on a new SQL server the Access Information Center service was able to finalize indexing script and successfully connected to new SQL db.
Then we also did an upgrade to 11.6.0.141 build for the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) core installation - upgrade was performed in-place without removing sandbox folder jobs.

We verified upgrade by accessing Published Reports page and by checking Jobs configuration.
As we agreed - lets keep ticket open until next Monday. I will follow up with you by then.

Thank you!

Hi Vinay,

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
The following is a recap of what was done:

After updating the Storage profile for the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) we confirmed successful connection to Published Reports.
However, Access Information Center web page could not be secured. As such, we have updated certificate binding for port 481 (AIC service port on your server) using latest certificate.

As a result we were able to open secure connection to AIC, but we were presented with another issue - AIC was still trying to connect to old SQL db.
According to information from this helpcenter article:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Database.htm
AIC SQL db connection can be changed either during installation, or after logging into AIC.

Since we were unable to login into AIC (because original StealthAudit DB is in read-only mode) - we uninstalled and installed AIC version 11.6.0.37.
During installation we provided connection information for a new SQL DB.
We also noticed that DB connection using UPN format times out. As such, we switched to NetBIOS name format (domainuser) for the service log on settings and connection was successful as confirmed by DBA. 
After installing new AIC we changed AIC exe config file and provided ""https"" value in the site binding parameter instead of ""http"". Current AIC exe config should have a binding for ""https"" on port 481.

As of now AIC is running an indexing script against StealthAudit db on a new SQL server. We agreed to leave it running for 30-60 minutes, then check results.
Please, let me know once you have results

Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Vinay, 

I just wanted to send a follow up to you about our ticket for Enterprise Auditor database migration.

Last time me you and a member of your DBA team discussed migration and verified that new SQL server is ready for migrating StealthAudit database.
As such, do you have the exact time when are you planning to migrate database? Is this change planned for tomorrow, 23rd of April?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Vinay,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.
The following is a recap of this meeting:

We installed OleDB 18 Provider on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server.
After this connection to new SQL server via .udl file was successful for  ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account using Windows Authentication. 

We then tested the same connection via Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console - connection was successful but we could not get the list of available databases due to missing VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission on the 'master' db.
For testing purposes the VIEW ANY DEFINITION permission was provided for ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account.

After this we opened Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console using ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account and tested connection to new SQL server again - it was successful and there was no issue with getting list of available databases.

This confirms that Netwrix Enterprise Auditor as well as ad_wwgrm.stb_ai account are ready for migration to a new SQL server.

Please, let me know once you have exact time window to apply this change. For now I have added a placeholder meeting for Wednesday, 23rd of April, at 12:00 noon GMT +4 (01:30 PM IST).

Happy holidays Vinay! I am looking forward to hearing back from you.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Artem,

Our SQL team has involved MSFT and as per them, we need to implement a change which required downtime of the SQL DB. I am coordinating with them & will update you further.

Please keep this ticket in pending state.

Thanks,
Vinay
