"500Qk00000GRWHDIA5","00422464","Support Ticket","Final File Check before Migration","We have successfully migrated all of the files in our NEA Migration folder over to the new server. We wanted to schedule a time to confirm we have everything needed to begin the migration. This is a more time sensitive issue as we are being pressed by Chubb infrastructure to decommission our old server.","","we talked through the StealthAUDIT migration process.

before our next meeting the client plans to have:
--the SQL databases transferred over
--disabled the scheduled tasks in StealthAUDIT
--ran the provided scrip on the SQL server to change the host name of the application server in the SQL database
--downloaded the NEA 11.5 and the AIC installers on the new server (My Products (netwrix.com))

---------------
successfully installed StealthAUDIT 11.5 on the new server and copied over the old configuration.

You do still need to configure the CyberArk Intergration so you can change the Schedule account.

We still need a follow-up meeting to confirm everything is working after you get the CyberArk integration configured. We also need to install the Access Information Center on the new server. Please use this link to schedule:","client is waiting for new license
the holdup is on their end
they have an intermediate license currently

once they get the new license, they will open an upgrade ticket","continuation of the ticket: 00399999
