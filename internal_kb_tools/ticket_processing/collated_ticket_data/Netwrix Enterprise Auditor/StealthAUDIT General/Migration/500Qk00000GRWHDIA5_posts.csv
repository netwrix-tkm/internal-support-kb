---------------
successfully installed StealthAUDIT 11.5 on the new server and copied over the old configuration.

You do still need to configure the CyberArk Intergration so you can change the Schedule account.

We still need a follow-up meeting to confirm everything is working after you get the CyberArk integration configured. We also need to install the Access Information Center on the new server. Please use this link to schedule:","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-12-11T13:36:36.000Z"
