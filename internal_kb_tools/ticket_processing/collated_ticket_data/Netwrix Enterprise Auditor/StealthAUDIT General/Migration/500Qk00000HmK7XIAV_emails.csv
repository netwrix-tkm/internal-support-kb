Hello Hanif,

Here is the link to schedule the NEA migration, this and the StealthINTERCEPT migrations should be done first, so please make sure they are done before the others.

Hi Hanif,

The jobs need to be run to generate new reports, you only see the Active Directory Inventory because we ran that job after the upgrade.
