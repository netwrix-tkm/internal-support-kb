Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we install the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor on the new server.
We migrate the data from the old server to the new server. Now, we are waiting for your DBA to run the SQL script to change the server name in the database before we can launch the Enterprise Auditor application.
We installed the proxy and the Sensitive Data Add-on in the new proxy server.
 
In the next meeting, we will launch the application, update the host list with the new proxy server, install the AIC, and you will recreate the schedule for jobs that were scheduled to run.
 
You can use the link below to schedule the meeting.
