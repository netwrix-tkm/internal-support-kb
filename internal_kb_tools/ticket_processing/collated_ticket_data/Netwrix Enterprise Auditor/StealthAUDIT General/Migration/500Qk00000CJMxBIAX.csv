As per the policy, we have to change the password for Stealth Audit account in our infra. Once changed, the new password needs to be keyed in on all the configurations on SA console. Request you to please provide us the details for where and all the password to be changed, or we will schedule the change and provide you the timing so that your support can be availed. DO let us know Friday availability in IST so that we can schedule the password change.

Thanks and Regards,
