client is migrating servers
currently using 2012 for SQL for NEA
need to move to 2019
client needs to decommission 2012 server soon

started process months ago

migration folder was created in earlier ticket

discussed the migration with the client
they need a long runway because of change control

they will schedule the actual migration with us on this ticket in about 2 weeks

at the time of the meeting, the client should already have
-the SQL data transferred over
-ran the provided scrip on the SQL server to change the host name of the application server in the SQL database
-downloaded the NEA 11.5 and the AIC installers on the new server

no AD Activity
no file system

only AD inventory and Windows auditing

not currently using Published reporting site nor the AIC

would like to setup the AIC on new server","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-10-02T18:45:17.000Z","2024-10-02T18:45:17.000Z","false","false"
