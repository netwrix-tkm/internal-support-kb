Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.  I have provided helpful documents below to verify the latest required provisions for the new server as well as the application. 

Requirements

Additionally, we will perform a pre-flight process in preparation for the official migration and 11.6 upgrade. The following will be preformed:

	Screenshots of your global settings as well as custom job query settings.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
 Performed the pre-flight process in preparation of the official migration/upgrade process. The pre-flight includes the following:

	Screenshots of all global settings and custom job settings. 
	Backups of the Jobs folder. 
	Backups of all listed files and folders below.



Additionally, backups of the database should be restored the day of the upgrade as well as the SQL script that needs to be run to migrate the host data since the SQL hostname is changing. I have attached a helpful document that can assist with migrating this data to this email. 

You will need to download the latest version of the installer from your netwrix.com customer account as well as verify that the installer has been unblocked. I have provided a list of those installers below:

	Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Management Platform
	Sensitive Data Discovery
	Access Information Center


Our next steps are:

You will:

Verify there are no running scheduled jobs.

Perform the backup and restore process when moving the SQL database. 

Run the SQL script to migrate the host data to the new SQL server. 

You will need to download the latest version of the installer from your netwrix.com customer account as well as verify that the installer has been unblocked.
