Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix/Stelthbits Install/Service path(s)
(Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Service -PipelineVariable Service |Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like 'Stealth*'}).Pathname
(Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Service -PipelineVariable Service |Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -like 'Netwrix*'}).Pathname 

Thank You for your time.

We did have to reset the Default ADMIN profile to get into the AIC to check configurations with the following query in the
SA_AIC_Authentication_FULL_JOIN_SA_AIC_ActiveDirectoryPrincipals.sql file that was sent during the call:


    SELECT TOP (1000) [TrusteeSID]
      ,[TrusteeType]
         ,NTAccount
         ,DisplayName
      ,[Role]
      ,[IsEnabled]
      ,[AccessType]
      ,[AccessList]
  FROM [dbo].[SA_AIC_Authentication] 
  FULL OUTER JOIN  [dbo].[SA_AIC_ActiveDirectoryPrincipals] ON ObjectSID = TrusteeSID

  --SELECT * FROM [dbo].[SA_AIC_Authentication] 

  --SELECT * FROM [dbo].[SA_AIC_ActiveDirectoryPrincipals]

  /*-- if needed enable AIC built-in Admin in SQL

---  in the *StealthAUDIT ComplianceWeb.config clear the value in <add key=""AuthBuiltinAdminPassword"" value="""" />  

UPDATE SA_AIC_Authentication
SET IsEnabled = 1
WHERE TrusteeSID = 'X-1-1-0'

*/

Once that was completed we were able to uninstall the older applications and install the builds noted above.
The service account was also updated to an Admin within the AIC console.

Re-built the Reports Folder and confirmed the 8082 and 81 URLs were both functional.

Enabled the host LongPathsEnabled within the Registry ***NOTE*** Reboot is required to full take affect
^^^ Recommend enabling this on all Windows File Servers as well ^^^

Set the Host PageFile to only use the E: Drive to mitigate issues with the SDD scans.
***RECOMMEND*** Increasing the vCPUs from 4 to 8

Here is our new Scheduling Link for the 11.5 to 11.6 upgrade if all the jobs run successfully over the weekend

Justin,

Per our call today we upgraded the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

FROM:
StealthAUDIT (SA)                            10.0.0.168

Sensitive Data Add-On (SDD)            11.5.0.65

We did have to reset the Default ADMIN profile to get into the AIC to check configurations with the following query in the
SA_AIC_Authentication_FULL_JOIN_SA_AIC_ActiveDirectoryPrincipals.sql file that was sent during the call:


    SELECT TOP (1000) [TrusteeSID]

  FULL OUTER JOIN  [dbo].[SA_AIC_ActiveDirectoryPrincipals] ON ObjectSID = TrusteeSID

  --SELECT * FROM [dbo].[SA_AIC_Authentication]

  /*-- if needed enable AIC built-in Admin in SQL

Once that was completed we were able to uninstall the older applications and install the builds noted above.
The service account was also updated to an Admin within the AIC console.

Justin,

Per our call today we upgraded the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

FROM:
StealthAUDIT (SA)                            10.0.0.168      
SA Access Information (AIC)            10.0.0.73
SA Sensitive Data (SDD)                   10.0.0.87

TO:
StealthAUDIT (SA)                            11.5.0.279
Access Information Center (AIC)       11.5.0.138
Sensitive Data Add-On (SDD)            11.5.0.65

We did have to reset the Default ADMIN profile to get into the AIC to check configurations with the following query in the
SA_AIC_Authentication_FULL_JOIN_SA_AIC_ActiveDirectoryPrincipals.sql file that was sent during the call:


    SELECT TOP (1000) [TrusteeSID]
      ,[TrusteeType]
         ,NTAccount
         ,DisplayName
      ,[Role]
      ,[IsEnabled]
      ,[AccessType]
      ,[AccessList]
  FROM [dbo].[SA_AIC_Authentication] 
  FULL OUTER JOIN  [dbo].[SA_AIC_ActiveDirectoryPrincipals] ON ObjectSID = TrusteeSID

  --SELECT * FROM [dbo].[SA_AIC_Authentication] 

  --SELECT * FROM [dbo].[SA_AIC_ActiveDirectoryPrincipals]

  /*-- if needed enable AIC built-in Admin in SQL

---  in the *StealthAUDIT ComplianceWeb.config clear the value in <add key=""AuthBuiltinAdminPassword"" value="""" />  

UPDATE SA_AIC_Authentication
SET IsEnabled = 1
WHERE TrusteeSID = 'X-1-1-0'

*/

Once that was completed we were able to uninstall the older applications and install the builds noted above.
The service account was also updated to an Admin within the AIC console.

Re-built the Reports Folder and confirmed the 8082 and 81 URLs were both functional.

Enabled the host LongPathsEnabled within the Registry ***NOTE*** Reboot is required to full take affect
^^^ Recommend enabling this on all Windows File Servers as well ^^^

Set the Host PageFile to only use the E: Drive to mitigate issues with the SDD scans.
***RECOMMEND*** Increasing the vCPUs from 4 to 8

Here is our new Scheduling Link for the 11.5 to 11.6 upgrade if all the jobs run successfully over the weekend
