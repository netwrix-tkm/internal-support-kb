URs are both HTTP based.


Ran into issues with the SA DB being corrupted past back-ups also seemed to be in the same state.

DBCC CHECKDB
And 
DBCC CHECKDB(StealthAudit, REPAIR_REBUILD)
 
Both complained about the DB Error page PFS page/Status

Restored from an even older back from 5/12 issue persist

Re-build the StealthAudit DB

Re-populated the Host list
We had to rebuild the Agent connection to the DRProd host to be able to update the NAM console to clear the Warning.

Created a BU_ folder under the FileSystem install path to remove all the duplicate jobs.

Confirmed the FileSystem job settings for the 2 file servers.

Scheduled out the FileSystem job(s) to run as needed.","Guidance","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Upgrade","11.5","245","31.9","Closed - Resolved","Chimera Investment Corporation","Dhruman Shah","2024-06-07T16:33:27.000Z","2024-07-09T14:54:14.000Z"
