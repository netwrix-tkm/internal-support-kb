Dusty,

Any reason the scheduler won’t let me see beyond 6/28?  At this point I’m probably not going to be ready for Prod/Fail upgrades until early July.  Kind regards,

I typically only block out for 2 weeks (unless I’m in the middle of the week) of openings I have extended the link out till 07/05/2024.

Let me know if we need to extend longer as management might want us to close this and open a new ticket closer to the time, we can perform the upgrades.

Dusty,

We are tentatively thinking about the 6/27 date. But I want to confirm if that is just an info gathering/recon session we have first. (that was the same thing we did on first meeting for our Dev/Stg environment). Or would that 6/27 meeting actually be performing the upgrade?

I’m just trying to book it out and schedule our change request to get through CAB etc.

If that 1st session is indeed just recon, what do you think about recon on 6/27 and then, actually doing the upgrade on 7/9 for our Prod/Fail?

Thanks,

Patrick,

I typically only block out for 2 weeks (unless I’m in the middle of the week) of openings I have extended the link out till 07/05/2024.

Let me know if we need to extend longer as management might want us to close this and open a new ticket closer to the time, we can perform the upgrades.

Again, thank You for your time.

Dusty, 

 

6/27 still works for me if available. Then we can see where we land after that for the actual upgrade.

Patrick,

Correct the 1st meeting would be recon, we will then schedule the upgrade if that day and time are open on 7/9 we can block that out at that time if not we can use a new TimeTrade (TT) link to block it out.

Again, thank You for your time.

Dusty, 

 

We are tentatively thinking about the 6/27 date. But I want to confirm if that is just an info gathering/recon session we have first. (that was the same thing we did on first meeting for our Dev/Stg environment). Or would that 6/27 meeting actually be performing the upgrade? 

 

I’m just trying to book it out and schedule our change request to get through CAB etc.   

 

If that 1st session is indeed just recon, what do you think about recon on 6/27 and then, actually doing the upgrade on 7/9 for our Prod/Fail? 

 

Thanks,

Per our call today we looked at the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

StealthAUDIT (SA)                            11.5.0.214 
SA Access Information (AIC)            11.5.0.125

Noted a ReadOnly issue with the FSAC SQLite DB checking with Dev on it now.

Could I get the Robocopy scripts as an email attachment and the StealthBits_Host_Details.txt as a file upload to this case?
 
Recommend:  
# Enable Long Paths in Windows
Clear-Host
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled

Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"" -Name ""LongPathsEnabled"" -Value 1

(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled

Dusty, 

 

6/27 still works for me if available. Then we can see where we land after that for the actual upgrade. 

 

Thanks,

Patrick,

Correct the 1st meeting would be recon, we will then schedule the upgrade if that day and time are open on 7/9 we can block that out at that time if not we can use a new TimeTrade (TT) link to block it out.

Again, thank You for your time.

Dusty, 

 

We are tentatively thinking about the 6/27 date. But I want to confirm if that is just an info gathering/recon session we have first. (that was the same thing we did on first meeting for our Dev/Stg environment). Or would that 6/27 meeting actually be performing the upgrade? 

 

I’m just trying to book it out and schedule our change request to get through CAB etc.   

 

If that 1st session is indeed just recon, what do you think about recon on 6/27 and then, actually doing the upgrade on 7/9 for our Prod/Fail? 

 

Thanks,

Patrick,

I typically only block out for 2 weeks (unless I’m in the middle of the week) of openings I have extended the link out till 07/05/2024.

Let me know if we need to extend longer as management might want us to close this and open a new ticket closer to the time, we can perform the upgrades.

Again, thank You for your time.

Dusty,

Attached to the case just now, reference [2024_0627_StealthAudit.PRD.FAIL.zip].

The zip file contains results from PowerShell scripts, and also Robocopy jobs used for backing up prd data files over to failover server.
And also, the failover RoboCopy jobs that are disabled to push the updated data back to PRD (if we ever had an actual DR event – but they are disabled currently on the fail server. But we will still have to update the pathing I believe on all the scripts being used).

Thank you for session today.

Patrick,

Per our call today we looked at the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

StealthAUDIT (SA)                            11.5.0.214
SA Access Information (AIC)            11.5.0.125

Noted a ReadOnly issue with the FSAC SQLite DB checking with Dev on it now.

Could I get the Robocopy scripts as an email attachment and the StealthBits_Host_Details.txt as a file upload to this case?

Recommend:
# Enable Long Paths in Windows
Clear-Host
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled

Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"" -Name ""LongPathsEnabled"" -Value 1

(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled
#**NOTE** A system reboot would be required to fully enable.

Dusty, 

 

Attached to the case just now, reference [2024_0627_StealthAudit.PRD.FAIL.zip].  

 

The zip file contains results from PowerShell scripts, and also Robocopy jobs used for backing up prd data files over to failover server. 

And also, the failover RoboCopy jobs that are disabled to push the updated data back to PRD (if we ever had an actual DR event – but they are disabled currently on the fail server. But we will still have to update the pathing I believe on all the scripts being used). 

 

Thank you for session today.

Patrick,

Per our call today we looked at the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

StealthAUDIT (SA)                            11.5.0.214 
SA Access Information (AIC)            11.5.0.125

Noted a ReadOnly issue with the FSAC SQLite DB checking with Dev on it now.

Could I get the Robocopy scripts as an email attachment and the StealthBits_Host_Details.txt as a file upload to this case?
 
Recommend:  
# Enable Long Paths in Windows
Clear-Host
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled

Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"" -Name ""LongPathsEnabled"" -Value 1

(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled 
#**NOTE** A system reboot would be required to fully enable.

Patrick,

Correct the 1st meeting would be recon, we will then schedule the upgrade if that day and time are open on 7/9 we can block that out at that time if not we can use a new TimeTrade (TT) link to block it out.

Again, thank You for your time.

Dusty, 

 

We are tentatively thinking about the 6/27 date. But I want to confirm if that is just an info gathering/recon session we have first. (that was the same thing we did on first meeting for our Dev/Stg environment). Or would that 6/27 meeting actually be performing the upgrade? 

 

I’m just trying to book it out and schedule our change request to get through CAB etc.   

 

If that 1st session is indeed just recon, what do you think about recon on 6/27 and then, actually doing the upgrade on 7/9 for our Prod/Fail? 

 

Thanks,

Patrick,

I typically only block out for 2 weeks (unless I’m in the middle of the week) of openings I have extended the link out till 07/05/2024.

Let me know if we need to extend longer as management might want us to close this and open a new ticket closer to the time, we can perform the upgrades.

Again, thank You for your time.

Any reason the scheduler won’t let me see beyond 6/28?  At this point I’m probably not going to be ready for Prod/Fail upgrades until early July.  Kind regards,

My son’s baseball tournament got in the way of this – my apologies.

Dusty,

We are tentatively thinking about the 6/27 date. But I want to confirm if that is just an info gathering/recon session we have first. (that was the same thing we did on first meeting for our Dev/Stg environment). Or would that 6/27 meeting actually be performing the upgrade?

I’m just trying to book it out and schedule our change request to get through CAB etc.

If that 1st session is indeed just recon, what do you think about recon on 6/27 and then, actually doing the upgrade on 7/9 for our Prod/Fail?

Thanks,

I typically only block out for 2 weeks (unless I’m in the middle of the week) of openings I have extended the link out till 07/05/2024.

Let me know if we need to extend longer as management might want us to close this and open a new ticket closer to the time, we can perform the upgrades.

Dusty – just an FYI that I’ve had to reschedule our planned meeting for our prod/fail upgrades from Thurs 7/11, now to Tuesday 7/16 @ 9:30am EDT. 

 

My son’s baseball tournament got in the way of this – my apologies. 

 

Thank you kindly,

Dusty, 

 

Attached to the case just now, reference [2024_0627_StealthAudit.PRD.FAIL.zip].  

 

The zip file contains results from PowerShell scripts, and also Robocopy jobs used for backing up prd data files over to failover server. 

And also, the failover RoboCopy jobs that are disabled to push the updated data back to PRD (if we ever had an actual DR event – but they are disabled currently on the fail server. But we will still have to update the pathing I believe on all the scripts being used). 

 

Thank you for session today.

Patrick,

Per our call today we looked at the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

StealthAUDIT (SA)                            11.5.0.214 
SA Access Information (AIC)            11.5.0.125

Noted a ReadOnly issue with the FSAC SQLite DB checking with Dev on it now.

Could I get the Robocopy scripts as an email attachment and the StealthBits_Host_Details.txt as a file upload to this case?
 
Recommend:  
# Enable Long Paths in Windows
Clear-Host
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled

Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"" -Name ""LongPathsEnabled"" -Value 1

(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled 
#**NOTE** A system reboot would be required to fully enable.

Per our call today we upgraded from the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Prod & Fail Environments:

FROM:
StealthAUDIT (SA)                            11.5.0.214

New install paths:

On both Prod and Fail we ran the following to update the URL Certs
Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:LocalMachineMy |Select-Object -Property * |Sort-Object NotAfter |Sort-Object NotAfter -Descending |
Format-Table Thumbprint,Subject,FriendlyName, NotAfter -AutoSize

##netsh update SSL Cert

netsh http add urlacl url=https://+:8082/ user=""NT AUTHORITYLOCAL SERVICE"" listen=yes delegate=no 


***NOTE*** Post a Fail over the following would need to be ran if the Prod SQL instance/DB is being used PRIOR to loading the console, same once back on Prod.

--  SA HOST MIRGRATED SQL UPDATE SCRIPT 
Declare @OHost varchar (128)
Declare @NHost varchar (128)

Dusty – just an FYI that I’ve had to reschedule our planned meeting for our prod/fail upgrades from Thurs 7/11, now to Tuesday 7/16 @ 9:30am EDT. 

 

My son’s baseball tournament got in the way of this – my apologies. 

 

Thank you kindly,

Dusty, 

 

Attached to the case just now, reference [2024_0627_StealthAudit.PRD.FAIL.zip].  

 

The zip file contains results from PowerShell scripts, and also Robocopy jobs used for backing up prd data files over to failover server. 

And also, the failover RoboCopy jobs that are disabled to push the updated data back to PRD (if we ever had an actual DR event – but they are disabled currently on the fail server. But we will still have to update the pathing I believe on all the scripts being used). 

 

Thank you for session today.

Patrick,

Per our call today we looked at the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

StealthAUDIT (SA)                            11.5.0.214 
SA Access Information (AIC)            11.5.0.125

Noted a ReadOnly issue with the FSAC SQLite DB checking with Dev on it now.

Could I get the Robocopy scripts as an email attachment and the StealthBits_Host_Details.txt as a file upload to this case?
 
Recommend:  
# Enable Long Paths in Windows
Clear-Host
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled

Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"" -Name ""LongPathsEnabled"" -Value 1

(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled 
#**NOTE** A system reboot would be required to fully enable.

6/27 still works for me if available. Then we can see where we land after that for the actual upgrade.

Patrick,

Correct the 1st meeting would be recon, we will then schedule the upgrade if that day and time are open on 7/9 we can block that out at that time if not we can use a new TimeTrade (TT) link to block it out.

Again, thank You for your time.

Dusty, 

 

We are tentatively thinking about the 6/27 date. But I want to confirm if that is just an info gathering/recon session we have first. (that was the same thing we did on first meeting for our Dev/Stg environment). Or would that 6/27 meeting actually be performing the upgrade? 

 

I’m just trying to book it out and schedule our change request to get through CAB etc.   

 

If that 1st session is indeed just recon, what do you think about recon on 6/27 and then, actually doing the upgrade on 7/9 for our Prod/Fail? 

 

Thanks,

Patrick,

I typically only block out for 2 weeks (unless I’m in the middle of the week) of openings I have extended the link out till 07/05/2024.

Let me know if we need to extend longer as management might want us to close this and open a new ticket closer to the time, we can perform the upgrades.

Again, thank You for your time.

Any reason the scheduler won’t let me see beyond 6/28?  At this point I’m probably not going to be ready for Prod/Fail upgrades until early July.  Kind regards,

Dusty – just an FYI that I’ve had to reschedule our planned meeting for our prod/fail upgrades from Thurs 7/11, now to Tuesday 7/16 @ 9:30am EDT.

My son’s baseball tournament got in the way of this – my apologies.

Thank you kindly,

Dusty,

Attached to the case just now, reference [2024_0627_StealthAudit.PRD.FAIL.zip].

The zip file contains results from PowerShell scripts, and also Robocopy jobs used for backing up prd data files over to failover server.
And also, the failover RoboCopy jobs that are disabled to push the updated data back to PRD (if we ever had an actual DR event – but they are disabled currently on the fail server. But we will still have to update the pathing I believe on all the scripts being used).

Thank you for session today.

Patrick,

Per our call today we looked at the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

StealthAUDIT (SA)                            11.5.0.214
SA Access Information (AIC)            11.5.0.125

Noted a ReadOnly issue with the FSAC SQLite DB checking with Dev on it now.

Could I get the Robocopy scripts as an email attachment and the StealthBits_Host_Details.txt as a file upload to this case?

Recommend:
# Enable Long Paths in Windows
Clear-Host
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled

Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"" -Name ""LongPathsEnabled"" -Value 1

(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled
#**NOTE** A system reboot would be required to fully enable.

Correct the 1st meeting would be recon, we will then schedule the upgrade if that day and time are open on 7/9 we can block that out at that time if not we can use a new TimeTrade (TT) link to block it out.

Dusty,

We are tentatively thinking about the 6/27 date. But I want to confirm if that is just an info gathering/recon session we have first. (that was the same thing we did on first meeting for our Dev/Stg environment). Or would that 6/27 meeting actually be performing the upgrade?

I’m just trying to book it out and schedule our change request to get through CAB etc.

If that 1st session is indeed just recon, what do you think about recon on 6/27 and then, actually doing the upgrade on 7/9 for our Prod/Fail?

Thanks,

I typically only block out for 2 weeks (unless I’m in the middle of the week) of openings I have extended the link out till 07/05/2024.

Let me know if we need to extend longer as management might want us to close this and open a new ticket closer to the time, we can perform the upgrades.

Patrick,

Per our call today we upgraded from the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Prod & Fail Environments:

FROM:
StealthAUDIT (SA)                            11.5.0.214
SA Access Information (AIC)            11.5.0.125   
Stealthbits Activity (SAM)                  6.0.1111

TO:
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA)                11.6.0.75
NEA Access Information Center (AIC)         11.6.0.14
Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM)                 7.0.3119

New install paths:
D:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsAccess Information Center
D:Program FilesNetwrixActivity Monitor

On both Prod and Fail we ran the following to update the URL Certs
Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:LocalMachineMy |Select-Object -Property * |Sort-Object NotAfter |Sort-Object NotAfter -Descending |
Format-Table Thumbprint,Subject,FriendlyName, NotAfter -AutoSize

##netsh update SSL Cert

$guid = ""bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8"" # This will be the same for all installations because it is a GUID from the built-in webserver application
$certHash = ""INSERT THUMBNAIL VALUE FROM STEP 2 BETWEEN QUOTES""
$ip = ""0.0.0.0"" # this means all IP addresses
$port = ""8082"" # the default HTTPS port
""http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}"" | netsh

## AIC 11.6+
netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:481
$guid = ""bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8"" # This will be the same for all installations because it is a GUID from the built-in webserver application
$certHash = ""INSERT THUMBNAIL VALUE FROM STEP 2 BETWEEN QUOTES""
$ip = ""0.0.0.0"" # this means all IP addresses
$port = ""481"" # the default HTTPS port
""http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}"" | netsh

Netwrix Access Information Center 11.6 > Installation Overview > Securing the Access Information Center

We did have to run the following to correctly load the NEA URL.
#11.6 URL issues post upgrade ""fix"" ## If there are issues
netsh http show urlacl
netsh http delete urlacl url=""http://+:8082/""
netsh http add urlacl url=https://+:8082/ user=""NT AUTHORITYLOCAL SERVICE"" listen=yes delegate=no 


***NOTE*** Post a Fail over the following would need to be ran if the Prod SQL instance/DB is being used PRIOR to loading the console, same once back on Prod.

--  SA HOST MIRGRATED SQL UPDATE SCRIPT 
Declare @OHost varchar (128)
Declare @NHost varchar (128)
Set @OHost = '<OldSever>' -- Name of the original SA Console being cloned
Set @NHost = '<NewServer>' -- Name of the new SA Console
Update [HostMaster_SANodeFilter]
SET SA_Node = @NHost
Where SA_Node = @OHost;
Update [HostListsTbl]
SET SA_Node = @NHost
Where SA_Node = @OHost;
Update [QueryTbl]
SET SA_Node = @NHost
Where SA_Node = @OHost;


Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Again, thank You for your time.

Dusty – just an FYI that I’ve had to reschedule our planned meeting for our prod/fail upgrades from Thurs 7/11, now to Tuesday 7/16 @ 9:30am EDT. 

 

My son’s baseball tournament got in the way of this – my apologies. 

 

Thank you kindly,

Dusty, 

 

Attached to the case just now, reference [2024_0627_StealthAudit.PRD.FAIL.zip].  

 

The zip file contains results from PowerShell scripts, and also Robocopy jobs used for backing up prd data files over to failover server. 

And also, the failover RoboCopy jobs that are disabled to push the updated data back to PRD (if we ever had an actual DR event – but they are disabled currently on the fail server. But we will still have to update the pathing I believe on all the scripts being used). 

 

Thank you for session today.

Patrick,

Per our call today we looked at the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

StealthAUDIT (SA)                            11.5.0.214 
SA Access Information (AIC)            11.5.0.125

Noted a ReadOnly issue with the FSAC SQLite DB checking with Dev on it now.

Could I get the Robocopy scripts as an email attachment and the StealthBits_Host_Details.txt as a file upload to this case?
 
Recommend:  
# Enable Long Paths in Windows
Clear-Host
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled

Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"" -Name ""LongPathsEnabled"" -Value 1

(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetControlFileSystem"").LongPathsEnabled 
#**NOTE** A system reboot would be required to fully enable.

Dusty, 

 

6/27 still works for me if available. Then we can see where we land after that for the actual upgrade. 

 

Thanks,

Patrick,

Correct the 1st meeting would be recon, we will then schedule the upgrade if that day and time are open on 7/9 we can block that out at that time if not we can use a new TimeTrade (TT) link to block it out.

Again, thank You for your time.

Dusty, 

 

We are tentatively thinking about the 6/27 date. But I want to confirm if that is just an info gathering/recon session we have first. (that was the same thing we did on first meeting for our Dev/Stg environment). Or would that 6/27 meeting actually be performing the upgrade? 

 

I’m just trying to book it out and schedule our change request to get through CAB etc.   

 

If that 1st session is indeed just recon, what do you think about recon on 6/27 and then, actually doing the upgrade on 7/9 for our Prod/Fail? 

 

Thanks,

Patrick,

I typically only block out for 2 weeks (unless I’m in the middle of the week) of openings I have extended the link out till 07/05/2024.

Let me know if we need to extend longer as management might want us to close this and open a new ticket closer to the time, we can perform the upgrades.

Again, thank You for your time.

Dusty, 

 

Any reason the scheduler won’t let me see beyond 6/28?  At this point I’m probably not going to be ready for Prod/Fail upgrades until early July.  Kind regards,
