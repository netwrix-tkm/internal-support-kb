Hi Dusty,

On 11/4 work in AUDIT, we reexamined jobs for errors, and most of the prior ones are cleared, jobs running good, except for the following:


1-FSAC System Scan
WYDOC 4   /   WYDOC3   / Documentsdtc
Error scanning server (wydoc4, wydoc4): A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond 10.30.1.58:8767

Error scanning server (wydoc3, wydoc3): A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond 10.30.1.57:8767



ADDITIONALLY, there is an issue with the DL MEMBERSHIP11 job (the one with custom built reporting we are needing to clean up / migrate Dist Groups to O365:


zSandbox
DLMembership11
Invalid column name 'physicalDeliveryOfficeName'. | Task name: Add User Physical Location
Invalid object name 'SA_DLMembership_Result3'. | Task name:  Add DL Mailflow Message Count Last 30 Days
Unexpected exception: Encountered error: ""No columns available for the table:'SA_DLMembership_ResultFinal' to display data."" while generating report

Per our call today within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) 11.6.0.113 for the zSandbox > DLMembership11 Job the issue was that the ADI job was not longer collecting the Extended Attribute of the “physicalDe1iveryOfficeName”.

With this corrected in the Jobs >> .Active Directory Inventory>> 1-AD_Scan Query and the SA_ADInventory_ExtendedAttributesPivotView correctly populated post the next full job run.

We were able to Successfully complete the DLMembership11 job.

I will spin off a new case for the FSAC jobs post finding that a needed port is being blocked (8766)

Thank You for the update, I will close out this ticket as noted.

We have 30days to reopen once the closure email is received.

To reopen we can just reply to that email to bring the case back into my queue.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. 

Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,

 

On 11/4 work in AUDIT, we reexamined jobs for errors, and most of the prior ones are cleared, jobs running good, except for the following:

 

 

1-FSAC System Scan

WYDOC 4   /   WYDOC3   / Documentsdtc

Error scanning server (wydoc4, wydoc4): A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond 10.30.1.58:8767

 

Error scanning server (wydoc3, wydoc3): A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond 10.30.1.57:8767

 

 

 

ADDITIONALLY, there is an issue with the DL MEMBERSHIP11 job (the one with custom built reporting we are needing to clean up / migrate Dist Groups to O365:

 

 

zSandbox

DLMembership11

Invalid column name 'physicalDeliveryOfficeName'. | Task name: Add User Physical Location

Invalid object name 'SA_DLMembership_Result3'. | Task name:  Add DL Mailflow Message Count Last 30 Days

Unexpected exception: Encountered error: ""No columns available for the table:'SA_DLMembership_ResultFinal' to display data."" while generating report

Report generation task failed.

 

 

 

Thank you,
