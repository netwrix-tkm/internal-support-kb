We have some questions from the IT Technical Lead at St Margaret's Hospice and we'd like to know if you can provide some answers and / or input: 

-------------------------
We've had a couple of critical vulnerabilities appear on our Stealth Audit server recently.

The first is CVE-2024-53677 and is related to Apache Struts, the description says ""The file upload logic in Apache Struts is flawed, allowing an attacker to manipulate file upload parameters and enable path traversal. This can lead to the uploading of a malicious file, which can be used to perform Remote Code Execution."" and the file path is ""c:program files (x86)stealthbitsstealthauditactionssurveywebservletweb-inflib<a href='https://struts2-core-6.3.0.2.jar' target='_blank'>struts2-core-6.3.0.2.jar</a>"".

The second is CVE-2020-9493 and relates to Oracle Business Intelligence, the description says ""The vulnerability affects Oracle Siebel CRM versions 23.5 and prior. It resides in the Siebel Core component (Apache ZooKeeper) and can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access via HTTP"", I can't find the exact file path for this one, but when I go to the device inventory it seems to indicate that the Log4j component has several weaknesses, the file path is ""c:program files (x86)stealthbitsstealthauditfsaasensitivedatalib<a href='https://log4j-1.2.17.jar' target='_blank'>log4j-1.2.17.jar</a>"".

Looking back through my emails - in November last year, we were able to upgrade to the most recent version of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. (11.6), given there hasn't been a new update since 2023, is it correct to assume that the product is EOL/EOS?

I thought I'd reach out to see if there was anything we could do about it, I know for example with some of the Manage Engine products, often old .jar files were leftover from older versions and we were able to delete them without causing any problems.

Thanks,
