tried new API keys
-same error

Tay talked with Dev and they requested escalation
She took ownership of other ticket (the one for just upgrading NAM - 00423204)
escalating that ticket

rolled back client to revert NAM changes
had to then re-upgrade NAM because we already ran the new FS create schema job
re-upgraded the AIC

Also rolled back the proxyserver because of updated NAM agent that needed reverted
re-upgraded FSproxy service

confirmed that NAM was working
 NAM is back to version 6","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-10-30T18:40:37.000Z"
