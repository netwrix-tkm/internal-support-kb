Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we reviewed the current settings and took some screenshots for backup and we also make a copy of the job folder.
We made a copy of the webserver.exe just in case the file got reset after the update.
In the next meeting, we will update the StealthAUDIT application to the latest version.
You will download the StealthAUDIT application and Access Information Center.
Before moving the application to the server, remember to unblock them.
To download the Netwrix application, go to netwrix.com/support and click My Products.
 
You can use the link below to schedule the upgrade meeting.
