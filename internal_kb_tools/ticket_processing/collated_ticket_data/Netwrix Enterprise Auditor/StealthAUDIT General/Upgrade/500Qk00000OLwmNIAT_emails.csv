Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Since you're upgrading from 11.0, I suggest going to 11.6 first and confirming functionality.

Please make snapshots of your StealthAUDIT server and SQL Database Server it uses for data storage.

The upgrade instructions can be found here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Note that once the Enterprise Auditor installation process is complete, it is necessary to go through the Upgrade Wizard. To save your job structure please use Upgrade in Place where possible (outlined in the article).

To download the installation package please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and download version 11.6 (not 12.0).

Let me know if you need further assistance.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

We have also the Access Information Center installed. Do I need to upgrade it also first to version 11.6 or can I do the update at the end of the StealthAudit upgrade and directly install version 12.0? And first uninstall and then install the newer version here too?

AIC is much less affected by upgrades, so you can go to 12.0 directly. Do have a snapshot before upgrading, though. That can be performed after you are done with NEA(StealthAUDIT). Attaching an article for AIC as well, for reference purposes: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Since you're upgrading from 11.0, I suggest going to 11.6 first and confirming functionality.

Please make snapshots of your StealthAUDIT server and SQL Database Server it uses for data storage.

The upgrade instructions can be found here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Note that once the Enterprise Auditor installation process is complete, it is necessary to go through the Upgrade Wizard. To save your job structure please use Upgrade in Place where possible (outlined in the article).

To download the installation package please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and download version 11.6 (not 12.0).

Let me know if you need further assistance.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

San,

AIC is much less affected by upgrades, so you can go to 12.0 directly. Do have a snapshot before upgrading, though. That can be performed after you are done with NEA(StealthAUDIT). Attaching an article for AIC as well, for reference purposes: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm

Thank you I will do it like described.

We have also the Access Information Center installed. Do I need to upgrade it also first to version 11.6 or can I do the update at the end of the StealthAudit upgrade and directly install version 12.0? And first uninstall and then install the newer version here too?

Thanks for your support!

Please use the following article to perform the upgrade to 12.0. Please mind the considerations outlined in the article, as there are significant changes to some collectors, ignoring these considerations will result in errors: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Overview.htm

Hello Ilya,

we were able to successfully upgrade our StealthAudit to 11.6 and everything looks fine so far.
Would the next step be to upgrade to version 12.0 or how should we proceed?

Thank you!

The installation is complete and StealthAudit is successfully updated to version 12.0 and it looks fine.

We updated the AIC too but now the AIC is only working on the Server itself in the web browser and it’s not available anymore from any client e.g.
Also the AIC is complaining about the SSL certificate in the web browser on the server but it’s still valid. Is there no configuration in the IIS for the AIC or where is the webserver configured?

San,

AIC is much less affected by upgrades, so you can go to 12.0 directly. Do have a snapshot before upgrading, though. That can be performed after you are done with NEA(StealthAUDIT). Attaching an article for AIC as well, for reference purposes: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm

Thank you I will do it like described.

We have also the Access Information Center installed. Do I need to upgrade it also first to version 11.6 or can I do the update at the end of the StealthAudit upgrade and directly install version 12.0? And first uninstall and then install the newer version here too?

Thanks for your support!

San,

Please use the following article to perform the upgrade to 12.0. Please mind the considerations outlined in the article, as there are significant changes to some collectors, ignoring these considerations will result in errors: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Overview.htm

Hello Ilya,

we were able to successfully upgrade our StealthAudit to 11.6 and everything looks fine so far.
Would the next step be to upgrade to version 12.0 or how should we proceed?

Hello San,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Since you're upgrading from 11.0, I suggest going to 11.6 first and confirming functionality.

Please make snapshots of your StealthAUDIT server and SQL Database Server it uses for data storage.

The upgrade instructions can be found here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Note that once the Enterprise Auditor installation process is complete, it is necessary to go through the Upgrade Wizard. To save your job structure please use Upgrade in Place where possible (outlined in the article).

To download the installation package please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and download version 11.6 (not 12.0).

Let me know if you need further assistance.

Best wishes,

Thank you!

 

The installation is complete and StealthAudit is successfully updated to version 12.0 and it looks fine.

 

We updated the AIC too but now the AIC is only working on the Server itself in the web browser and it’s not available anymore from any client e.g.

Also the AIC is complaining about the SSL certificate in the web browser on the server but it’s still valid. Is there no configuration in the IIS for the AIC or where is the webserver configured?

There are no upgrade instructions in your provided article for version 12.0

So again first uninstall and then install, right?

Thanks and the access to AIC is now working with the server name but not with the default DNS name.
And the SSL certificate seems still invalid for some reason.

So maybe a quick call would be great 😊

San,

AIC is much less affected by upgrades, so you can go to 12.0 directly. Do have a snapshot before upgrading, though. That can be performed after you are done with NEA(StealthAUDIT). Attaching an article for AIC as well, for reference purposes: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm

Thank you I will do it like described.

We have also the Access Information Center installed. Do I need to upgrade it also first to version 11.6 or can I do the update at the end of the StealthAudit upgrade and directly install version 12.0? And first uninstall and then install the newer version here too?

Thanks for your support!

Hello Ilya,

we were able to successfully upgrade our StealthAudit to 11.6 and everything looks fine so far.
Would the next step be to upgrade to version 12.0 or how should we proceed?

Hello San,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Since you're upgrading from 11.0, I suggest going to 11.6 first and confirming functionality.

Please make snapshots of your StealthAUDIT server and SQL Database Server it uses for data storage.

The upgrade instructions can be found here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Note that once the Enterprise Auditor installation process is complete, it is necessary to go through the Upgrade Wizard. To save your job structure please use Upgrade in Place where possible (outlined in the article).

To download the installation package please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and download version 11.6 (not 12.0).

Let me know if you need further assistance.

Thanks and the access to AIC is now working with the server name but not with the default DNS name.

And the SSL certificate seems still invalid for some reason.

 

So maybe a quick call would be great 😊

San,

Please refer to this article, since your AIC might need SSL reconfiguration: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Secure.htm

If you'll encounter any issues with that, let me know and I'll arrange a quick meeting to check on your environment.

And the SSL certificate seems still invalid for some reason.

So maybe a quick call would be great 😊

San,

Please refer to this article, since your AIC might need SSL reconfiguration: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Secure.htm

If you'll encounter any issues with that, let me know and I'll arrange a quick meeting to check on your environment.

Thank you!

The installation is complete and StealthAudit is successfully updated to version 12.0 and it looks fine.

We updated the AIC too but now the AIC is only working on the Server itself in the web browser and it’s not available anymore from any client e.g.
Also the AIC is complaining about the SSL certificate in the web browser on the server but it’s still valid. Is there no configuration in the IIS for the AIC or where is the webserver configured?

So again first uninstall and then install, right?

San,

AIC is much less affected by upgrades, so you can go to 12.0 directly. Do have a snapshot before upgrading, though. That can be performed after you are done with NEA(StealthAUDIT). Attaching an article for AIC as well, for reference purposes: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm

Thank you I will do it like described.

We have also the Access Information Center installed. Do I need to upgrade it also first to version 11.6 or can I do the update at the end of the StealthAudit upgrade and directly install version 12.0? And first uninstall and then install the newer version here too?

Thanks for your support!

San,

Please use the following article to perform the upgrade to 12.0. Please mind the considerations outlined in the article, as there are significant changes to some collectors, ignoring these considerations will result in errors: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Overview.htm

Hello Ilya,

we were able to successfully upgrade our StealthAudit to 11.6 and everything looks fine so far.
Would the next step be to upgrade to version 12.0 or how should we proceed?

Hello San,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Since you're upgrading from 11.0, I suggest going to 11.6 first and confirming functionality.

Please make snapshots of your StealthAUDIT server and SQL Database Server it uses for data storage.

The upgrade instructions can be found here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Note that once the Enterprise Auditor installation process is complete, it is necessary to go through the Upgrade Wizard. To save your job structure please use Upgrade in Place where possible (outlined in the article).

To download the installation package please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and download version 11.6 (not 12.0).

Let me know if you need further assistance.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Thank you for your time today! On this meeting we checked the settings for your AIC. I've noticed that you have followed the article's default port allocation, which would be 481. However, that did not work, and since you've mentioned that you didn't have to specify the port previously in the address bar, and after checking the existing certificates, there was one for 443. After changing to that port in the AIC's config file and restarting the server, everything worked.

I'm going to close this ticket now, and if you'd like to leave some feedback - please complete a survey that will be sent to you afterwards. Any comments are appreciated!

And the SSL certificate seems still invalid for some reason.

 

So maybe a quick call would be great 😊

San,

Please refer to this article, since your AIC might need SSL reconfiguration: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Secure.htm

If you'll encounter any issues with that, let me know and I'll arrange a quick meeting to check on your environment.

Thank you!

 

The installation is complete and StealthAudit is successfully updated to version 12.0 and it looks fine.

 

We updated the AIC too but now the AIC is only working on the Server itself in the web browser and it’s not available anymore from any client e.g.

Also the AIC is complaining about the SSL certificate in the web browser on the server but it’s still valid. Is there no configuration in the IIS for the AIC or where is the webserver configured?

 

Best regards / Mit freundlichen Grüßen,

Thank you so for AIC it’s clear 😊

 

There are no upgrade instructions in your provided article for version 12.0

So again first uninstall and then install, right?

San,

AIC is much less affected by upgrades, so you can go to 12.0 directly. Do have a snapshot before upgrading, though. That can be performed after you are done with NEA(StealthAUDIT). Attaching an article for AIC as well, for reference purposes: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm

Thank you I will do it like described.

 

We have also the Access Information Center installed. Do I need to upgrade it also first to version 11.6 or can I do the update at the end of the StealthAudit upgrade and directly install version 12.0? And first uninstall and then install the newer version here too?

 

Thanks for your support!

San,

Please use the following article to perform the upgrade to 12.0. Please mind the considerations outlined in the article, as there are significant changes to some collectors, ignoring these considerations will result in errors: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Overview.htm

Hello Ilya,

 

we were able to successfully upgrade our StealthAudit to 11.6 and everything looks fine so far.

Would the next step be to upgrade to version 12.0 or how should we proceed?

 

Best regards

San

Hello San,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Since you're upgrading from 11.0, I suggest going to 11.6 first and confirming functionality.

Please make snapshots of your StealthAUDIT server and SQL Database Server it uses for data storage.

The upgrade instructions can be found here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Note that once the Enterprise Auditor installation process is complete, it is necessary to go through the Upgrade Wizard. To save your job structure please use Upgrade in Place where possible (outlined in the article).

To download the installation package please navigate to https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html log in and download version 11.6 (not 12.0).

Let me know if you need further assistance.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
