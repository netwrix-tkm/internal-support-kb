My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

I attempted to contact you at the number provided and it went to voicemail.
Can you use the below link to setup a time that we can take a look at this issue live to see why the Create Schema is taking so long.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Removed contstraints from the SA_FSAA ResourcesScanTypeDetails and SA_FSAA_ResourceMap to try and speed up the create schema job. We also ensured that the Create Scheme job was set to debug mode.


ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL
ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job, if it fails again upload logs to the ticket for review.



Thank you,

Hi Ian,

I’m sorry for not messaging you back yesterday. After the changes you made Friday, the schema update went through successfully.

Thank you again for your help. That issue has been resolved.

Subject: RE: 00442486 - '0-Create Schema' is still with 'SQL Script Executing: 1 of 3'
Hello Nicholas,

I wanted to follow up after our recent online meeting to see how things are going. I haven’t heard from you since our last discussion and wanted to check if you were able to make progress on the items we talked about or if you still need assistance.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further support—I’m here to help!

Looking forward to your response.

Ticket Number: 00442486
Ticket Subject: '0-Create Schema' is still with 'SQL Script Executing: 1 of 3'
Ticket Details: I think I'm having an issue similar to this:
<a href='https://community.netwrix.com/t/possible-issue-with-12-0/6177' target='_blank'>https://community.netwrix.com/t/possible-issue-with-12-0/6177</a>

One difference is that my job doesn't seem to run indefinitely. It runs for about a day, then quits and says a timeout was reached.

Can someone help me with the SQL migration so that I can begin using v12.0 correctly?

Thank you!

Thank you!
