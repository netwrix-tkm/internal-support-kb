Subject: Upgrade Enterprise Auditor from 11.6.0.92 to 11.6.0.138 [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0NPRKl:ref ]

Hello David,

The Enterprise Auditor upgrade is done in two parts. Below is a link you can use to schedule the pre-flight call so we can collect information on the system before the upgrade is done.
