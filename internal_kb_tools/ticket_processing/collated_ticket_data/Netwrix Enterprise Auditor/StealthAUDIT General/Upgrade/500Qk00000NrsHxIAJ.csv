We use threat prevention, threat manager, and FSAA but not sure if those tie in with sealthaudit. Our current instance is an EC2 instance and the DB is on a RDS instance.","","The customer is using the 11.5 version of StealthAUDIT and wants to know if we have a guide for upgrading to the 12.0 version (Netwrix Analyzer).","Waiting for the customer to reply","Documentation provided to the customer","Proactive Upgrade","Frantz Baptiste","Question","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Upgrade","11.5","","7.2","Closed - Resolved","HBK Capital Management","Gill Cerros","2025-04-09T14:49:53.000Z","2025-04-16T20:01:04.000Z"
