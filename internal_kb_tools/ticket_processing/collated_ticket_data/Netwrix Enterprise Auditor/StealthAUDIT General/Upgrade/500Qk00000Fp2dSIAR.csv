"500Qk00000Fp2dSIAR","00421116","Support Ticket","Weekend Upgrade Planning // FSAA Job cleanup question","Hi Team,
David Grom from Freedom Mortgage is looking to schedule an upgrade which must be done over the weekend during change control.  Their next change control window is Saturday, 10/12/2024 and it is preferred to conduct the upgrade in the morning hours.  Can we please have a resource aligned that can assist with the off hour upgrade and reach out for scheduling?

Also, David had a question regarding data saved from FSAA jobs – if there are servers they are no longer using, are there any potential problems with deleting them from the folder screenshotted below?
