Hey Ilya, 

 

Please move the next follow-up date to early next week, if that's okay? They've not performed the upgrades yet.

Hello Migs,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Please note that the version you're referring to, while being 'the latest' in terms of the version number, is not the latest build. Please refer to the following page to see individual improvements and fixes addressed in each build upgrade.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6_ReleaseNotes/resource/Netwrix_Enterprise_Auditor_11.6_BugFixList.pdf

We strongly recommend to upgrade to the latest build of NEA, you can download the installation packages from here: https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html

The files mentioned should be addressed, updated or deprecated with these updates.

If you have any further questions, please let me know.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Hello Migs,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Please note that the version you're referring to, while being 'the latest' in terms of the version number, is not the latest build. Please refer to the following page to see individual improvements and fixes addressed in each build upgrade.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6_ReleaseNotes/resource/Netwrix_Enterprise_Auditor_11.6_BugFixList.pdf

We strongly recommend to upgrade to the latest build of NEA, you can download the installation packages from here: https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html

The files mentioned should be addressed, updated or deprecated with these updates.

If you have any further questions, please let me know.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Hey Ilya,

Thanks for the follow-up.

Apologies for the delays. I've checked and they've upgraded some of the components of Manage Engine (Device Control / UEBA), but not to the latest build of NEA.

Thanks,

Hey Ilya,

Thanks for the follow-up.

Apologies for the delays. I've checked and they've upgraded some of the components of Manage Engine (Device Control / UEBA), but not to the latest build of NEA.

Thanks,

Hello Migs,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! My name is Ilya and I will be assisting you on this case.

Please note that the version you're referring to, while being 'the latest' in terms of the version number, is not the latest build. Please refer to the following page to see individual improvements and fixes addressed in each build upgrade.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6_ReleaseNotes/resource/Netwrix_Enterprise_Auditor_11.6_BugFixList.pdf

We strongly recommend to upgrade to the latest build of NEA, you can download the installation packages from here: https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html

The files mentioned should be addressed, updated or deprecated with these updates.

If you have any further questions, please let me know.

Best wishes,
