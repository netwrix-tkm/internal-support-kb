"500Qk00000HjST0IAN","00425724","Support Ticket","Upgrade follow on questions","I'm considering doing in-place application upgrades after our discussion for ticket 00423582.  

2 questions I have come up with - 
If I want to get my servers on 2022, should I do the OS upgrade before upgrading the applications?  Would it matter either way (the servers are currently running Server 2019).

The database sizing requirements documentation seems to point to using a Full Recovery Method for SQL with log drives, etc.  Currently, we've been told by support that using a Simple Recovery Method is best practice (all of our SQL files are on the same drive today).  Has this recommendation changed?  Now is my chance to get it setup properly.

FYI - I will be OOO for the next week so I will be unable to respond to any follow-up questions.","","not upgrading the OS anytime soon

1) Can I perform an in-place operating system upgrade on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor host server?

2) When migrating Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to a new server, should I upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor before or after migrating?

3) Should Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's database be in Simple Recovery Mode or Full Recovery Mode?


Resolution
1) We do not recommend performing an in-place upgrade for the Netwrix Application server's Operation System. It has been known to cause issues. We suggest spinning up a new server with the new OS and migrating Netwrix to the new server. 

2) We recommend migrating Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to the new server first, then after confirming everything is working as expected on the new server, upgrade to the latest version.

3) You should keep all of Netwrix' databases on simple recovery mode.
