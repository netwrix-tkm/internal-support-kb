within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) console we completed the following to correct the reporting error.
Symptom:
NEA 11.6 report failed to update.

Cause:
Reporting folder was not update correctly from the 11.5.0.232 install.

Resolution:
Rebuilt the Reports folder in the %sainstalldir% path.
Re-published the reports for the main jobs by re-running the related scheduled task.

Symptom:
FileSystem job noted an error for the “Tier 1 database schema is not up to date, run the Create Schema job”

Cause:
0-Create Schema was missing from the collection group
Resolution:
Added 0-Create Schema back into the job group and ran 2x to confirm all tables are correct.

Symptom:
Post for the zSandbox > DLMembership11 Job is not fully completing.
Cause:
The issue was that the ADI job was not longer collecting the Extended Attribute of the “physicalDe1iveryOfficeName”.
Resolution:
Corrected in the Jobs >> .Active Directory Inventory>> 1-AD_Scan Query by adding the needed Extended Attribute. 
The SA_ADInventory_ExtendedAttributesPivotView correctly populated post the next full job run.
The DLMembership11 job completed Successfully.","Guidance","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Upgrade","11.5","232","27.0","Closed - Resolved","West Yavapai Guidance Clinic, DBA Polara Health","Josh Taylor","2024-10-17T18:02:53.000Z","2024-11-13T18:51:39.000Z"
