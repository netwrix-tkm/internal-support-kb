* Netwrix Enterprise Auditor from version 11.6.0.130 to 12.0.1070
* 7x FSAA Proxy Servers from v11.6.0.37 to 12.0.0.1048
* Access Information Center from v11.6.0.32 to 12.0.0.48

Post-upgrade of the NEA Console and we're having some issues with the scheduled tasks where an archived jobs folder unzipped itself in the job directory. We removed that and re-imported Scheduled Tasks into the Windows Task Scheduler without issue. Post-fix, 0-CreateSchema was run and the Published Reports web service was set to use the NEA Service Account.","Proactive Upgrade","Tay Caliguiri","Request","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Upgrade","12.0","1070","19.0","Closed - Resolved","WellSpan Health","John Masgalas","2025-04-30T20:07:23.000Z","2025-05-19T19:14:31.000Z"
