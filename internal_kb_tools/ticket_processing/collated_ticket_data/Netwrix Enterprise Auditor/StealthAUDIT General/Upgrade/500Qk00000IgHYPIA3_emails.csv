This is the new ticket for upgrading StealthAUDIT to the latest version, Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6. StealthAUDIT upgrades require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to gather screenshots and backups of some configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

Please use the following links to schedule the 2 meetings. Please make the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=YyPf42Ka4caN0PuQ.d9txaGRIQELcASgEfQJvxlruR8-Z&MeetingID=iRcj1OIkwI1M8hj8DNJRgjaU3boO3pdhTZSmfKs_DhU-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=PuyKRCc5TxZyfzEE9Zmg5W8ivdTrcmmcyY3N4vHELsk-Z&MeetingID=oyuzJCoUnoxeuBvHmbkSha.PXJZlrmWJoz26eoL5LFU-Z

The Thanksgiving Holiday reduces my normal availability. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,
