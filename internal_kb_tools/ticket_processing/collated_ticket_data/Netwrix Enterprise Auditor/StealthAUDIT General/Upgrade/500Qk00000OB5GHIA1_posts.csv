<a href='https://community.netwrix.com/t/possible-issue-with-12-0/6177' target='_blank'>https://community.netwrix.com/t/possible-issue-with-12-0/6177</a>

One difference is that my job doesn't seem to run indefinitely. It runs for about a day, then quits and says a timeout was reached. 

Can someone help me with the SQL migration so that I can begin using v12.0 correctly? 

Thank you!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-17T20:29:39.000Z"

Issue seems to be similar to 00441249
On the call today we removed the foreign key constraints from SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails and SA_FSAA_ResourceMap. Debug logging was enabled and the query is running again but taking awhile. Customer will let us know if the issue resolves or times out again and will provide the debug logs if it fails.

ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourcesScanTypeDetails NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL
ALTER TABLE SA_FSAA_ResourceMap NOCHECK CONSTRAINT ALL
