Hello!

We were trying to upgrade our NFR Netwrix Access Analyzer in our (CoreWin) test environment.
We are using this NFR to provide the PoC for customers and test different scenarios, so that is why we want it to be up-to-date.
But since we are not the customer, but partner, we do not have any update files in the customer portal at https://www.netwrix.com/ behind ""My Products"".
Should we just contact support in case of future updates, or can we get the upgrade file somewhere?


Best regards,

I have not received a reply from you after sending a link to Partner`s Portal so I wanted to reach out with this small follow up.
Did you have time to check if you are able to download Netwrix Access Analyzer v12.0 from Partner`s Portal? 

If not, here are direct links for downloading latest Netwrix Access Analyzer and it`s modules:

SPAA Agent

If you are upgrading from 11.5 version, then it is recomended first performing an upgrade to 11.6 version, then to 12.0.

Prior to performing an upgrade, please, carefully read the Solution Upgrade Considerations article as upgrade to v12.0 has additional steps that must be performed if you are upgrading from previous version:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/SolutionConsiderations.htm

This article has detailed steps of the upgrade procedure for Netwrix Access Analyzer:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm
 

After upgrading Core and Access Information Center - perform an upgrade for FSAA Proxy as well. It is recommended using Manual upgrade for the FSAA Proxy module:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm

SharePoint Agent module for scanning SharePoint environment must be upgraded as well. This article has instructions for the upgrade procedure for this module:

Hello!

Thank you for following up.
Yes, we've managed to find the installation files, but when we tried to run the .msi file on the machine where Access Analyzer already installed, it returned an error saying that ""Access Analyzer"" is already installed and propose to delete it and install a newest version.
Is this only way to upgrade the Access Analyzer?
Thank you for the documentation links, I will look into it.

Thank you for the prompt reply.

Yes, that is correct - the first step is to delete Netwrix Access Analyzer core installation.
This is mentioned in the upgrade instructions from this article:
Access Analyzer Core Upgrade Instructions
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

Step 1 – From Programs and Features (Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features), uninstall the previous version of Access Analyzer. Jobs, application configuration files, and reports remain in the installation directory after the uninstall process.

NOTE: If you have the old Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-On installed, you must uninstall it before continuing with this upgrade. For Access Analyzer 12.0, Sensitive Data Discovery is installed as part of the main installation if your license includes it.


I strongly recommend following upgrade procedure instructions I`ve provided in my previous email:


If you are upgrading from 11.5 version, then it is recomended first performing an upgrade to 11.6 version, then to 12.0.

Prior to performing an upgrade, please, carefully read the Solution Upgrade Considerations article as upgrade to v12.0 has additional steps that must be performed if you are upgrading from previous version:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/SolutionConsiderations.htm

This article has detailed steps of the upgrade procedure for Netwrix Access Analyzer:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm

After upgrading Netwrix Access Analyzer core, the Access Information Center must be upgraded as well. The following article has instructions for the Access Information Center upgrade:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm
 

After upgrading Core and Access Information Center - perform an upgrade for FSAA Proxy as well. It is recommended using Manual upgrade for the FSAA Proxy module:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/FileSystemProxy/Upgrade.htm


SharePoint Agent module for scanning SharePoint environment must be upgraded as well. This article has instructions for the upgrade procedure for this module:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/SharePointAgent/Upgrade.htm

Please, let me know if you have any additional questions from your side - I will be happy to help!

Hello!

Thank you for following up.

Yes, we've managed to find the installation files, but when we tried to run the .msi file on the machine where Access Analyzer already installed, it returned an error saying that ""Access Analyzer"" is already installed and propose to delete it and install a newest version.

Is this only way to upgrade the Access Analyzer?
Thank you for the documentation links, I will look into it.

Hello!

We were trying to upgrade our NFR Netwrix Access Analyzer in our (CoreWin) test environment.

We are using this NFR to provide the PoC for customers and test different scenarios, so that is why we want it to be up-to-date.

But since we are not the customer, but partner, we do not have any update files in the customer portal at https://www.netwrix.com/ behind ""My Products"".

Should we just contact support in case of future updates, or can we get the upgrade file somewhere?

Hello CoreWin Tech team, 

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
My name is Artem and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

The Netwrix Access Analyzer version 12.0 installation files should be available in the customer portal at https://www.netwrix.com/ behind ""My Products"" page as long as the account has access to a valid license.
As such, may I ask you to clarify who is the end-customer for this support ticket? Could you share company name or a domain part of their website for example?

To continue, I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session to provide assistance with upgrading Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly known as Enterprise Auditor). Once we confirm the end customer and access to Access Analyzer latest version  installation files - I will share you a link to schedule a meeting for remote support.

I am looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

We are using this NFR to provide the PoC for customers and test different scenarios, so that is why we want it to be up-to-date.

But since we are not the customer, but partner, we do not have any update files in the customer portal at https://www.netwrix.com/ behind ""My Products"".

Should we just contact support in case of future updates, or can we get the upgrade file somewhere?

Subject: How to update Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) ? [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0NtnCX:ref ]

 



Hello CoreWin Tech team, 

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
My name is Artem and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

The Netwrix Access Analyzer version 12.0 installation files should be available in the customer portal at https://www.netwrix.com/ behind ""My Products"" page as long as the account has access to a valid license.
As such, may I ask you to clarify who is the end-customer for this support ticket? Could you share company name or a domain part of their website for example?

To continue, I would like to suggest scheduling a remote support session to provide assistance with upgrading Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly known as Enterprise Auditor). Once we confirm the end customer and access to Access Analyzer latest version  installation files - I will share you a link to schedule a meeting for remote support.

I am looking forward to hearing back from you. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA
