Hello Mike,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) in your dev and prod environments.

Typically, the upgrading NEA requires two meetings. The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to gather screenshots and backups of some configuration files. We do not make any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade. Since you have two environments to upgrade, we should probably just schedule the pre-flight meeting and see how far we can get. We may have time to gather the pre-flight details for both environments in one meeting. Then we can schedule the actual upgrades on the two separate days you requested.

The following links can be used to schedule the two meetings. Please make the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=fl2cayBYwfZmvc0wNwpd5hWjGl3yZa7cLGt2PJ3To_4-Z&MeetingID=Z253N8qzzfiw5HdoDdmeJoOL8lrag5HFcfwTrQWfygI-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=0FwcUjGvMt8iEhLvU7kfnuG1WSA7Hq0XL9u4qLw5dhw-Z&MeetingID=WLOsm3wu_3ruNEKgXYdVGMb9G4GrLVJasByPFXLI_uY-Z

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns with this process.

Thank you,

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we successfully upgraded your development environment to the lasted versions of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, the Access Information Center, and Netwrix Activity Monitor.

The only real hiccup we encountered was that the account used for the AIC and Published Reports to connect to SQL was blocked from interactive logins. I believe this is only necessary during the installation. Feel free to add that account back to the prohibited group and let me know if there are any issues.

The next step is to upgrade your production environment. The meeting for that upgrade is already scheduled on Friday, November 22nd, at 2:00PM EST.

Hi Joshua, I was validating the reporting website and the filesystem solution is the only one not showing reports.  I did check the ‘results’ of the filesystem job and I see all of the reports there but the website doesn’t show anything.

[cid:image001.png@01DB3F13.F1D29580]

I am re-running just generating the reports but the analysis takes a couple hours so it will be a while before I will see if this fixes the reports.

Thank you for the update. Please check to make sure the FileSystem Reports are set to publish to the site. Each report can be set individually, but it sounds like you should just set it at the top FileSystem group level and check the box, Set all the child objects to inherit these settings.

NEA > Jobs > FileSystem > Settings > Reporting



Then run the reports again. You don't need to run the whole FileSystem job group again for this test, as that might take a long time. You can select a group node that includes just reports (1.Open Access, for example) and run just that group. It will use the data from the last scan.



Please let me know how it looks.

Hello Mike,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) in your dev and prod environments.

Typically, the upgrading NEA requires two meetings. The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to gather screenshots and backups of some configuration files. We do not make any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade. Since you have two environments to upgrade, we should probably just schedule the pre-flight meeting and see how far we can get. We may have time to gather the pre-flight details for both environments in one meeting. Then we can schedule the actual upgrades on the two separate days you requested.

Hello Mike,

Thank you for the update. Please check to make sure the FileSystem Reports are set to publish to the site. Each report can be set individually, but it sounds like you should just set it at the top FileSystem group level and check the box, Set all the child objects to inherit these settings.

NEA > Jobs > FileSystem > Settings > Reporting

[cid:image001.png@01DB3F36.40040230]

Then run the reports again. You don't need to run the whole FileSystem job group again for this test, as that might take a long time. You can select a group node that includes just reports (1.Open Access, for example) and run just that group. It will use the data from the last scan.

[cid:image002.png@01DB3F36.40040230]

Please let me know how it looks.

Thank you,

Hi Joshua, I was validating the reporting website and the filesystem solution is the only one not showing reports.  I did check the ‘results’ of the filesystem job and I see all of the reports there but the website doesn’t show anything.

[cid:image003.png@01DB3F36.40040230]

I am re-running just generating the reports but the analysis takes a couple hours so it will be a while before I will see if this fixes the reports.

Hello Mike,

Thank you for meeting with me again. In our session we successfully upgraded your Production environment's deployment of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, the Access Information Center, Published Reports, and Netwrix Activity Monitor. We didn't encounter any real issues during the upgrade and all configurations seemed to remain intact.

We didn't upgrade all of Netwrix Activity Monitor's agents, but you said you will be able to do that on your own tomorrow.

During the call, you showed me how your FSAA logs go back for years and are occupying more than 100GB of drive space, even though retention is set to 7 days. I will research this internally and let you know what I find.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton

Hello Mike,

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we successfully upgraded your development environment to the lasted versions of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, the Access Information Center, and Netwrix Activity Monitor.

The only real hiccup we encountered was that the account used for the AIC and Published Reports to connect to SQL was blocked from interactive logins. I believe this is only necessary during the installation. Feel free to add that account back to the prohibited group and let me know if there are any issues.

The next step is to upgrade your production environment. The meeting for that upgrade is already scheduled on Friday, November 22nd, at 2:00PM EST.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton

Hello Mike,

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we completed the pre-flight for both your development and production environments. You've already scheduled the upgrade meeting for your dev environment on Nov. 18th, at 2:00pm. Please use the following link to schedule the upgrade on your production server:

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=7YYMy4yu3vboYjS.9rmgcxSqdDwD3lepH8OhOc1KeX8-Z&MeetingID=5Ro.w05.5J3plchvt4Xb6jKjtiZOyh18GwbgMMBQ7tU-Z

Important: Please make sure you have the credentials for the account NEA uses to connect to SQL.

Thank you,

Hello Mike,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) in your dev and prod environments.

Typically, the upgrading NEA requires two meetings. The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to gather screenshots and backups of some configuration files. We do not make any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade. Since you have two environments to upgrade, we should probably just schedule the pre-flight meeting and see how far we can get. We may have time to gather the pre-flight details for both environments in one meeting. Then we can schedule the actual upgrades on the two separate days you requested.

The following links can be used to schedule the two meetings. Please make the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=fl2cayBYwfZmvc0wNwpd5hWjGl3yZa7cLGt2PJ3To_4-Z&MeetingID=Z253N8qzzfiw5HdoDdmeJoOL8lrag5HFcfwTrQWfygI-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=0FwcUjGvMt8iEhLvU7kfnuG1WSA7Hq0XL9u4qLw5dhw-Z&MeetingID=WLOsm3wu_3ruNEKgXYdVGMb9G4GrLVJasByPFXLI_uY-Z

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns with this process.

Thank you,

I'd like to take a look at this over a remote session. I want to follow up with you about the excessive FSAA logs, as well. I learned that there was a bug that caused that to happen. The new version should have fixed it, but it doesn't clean up the old logs automatically. Thankfully, we do have a job that can be configured to do it for you, so there's no need to tediously go through the log folders for all the servers.

This ticket was originally for upgrading the software, which is complete, so I'm going to proceed with closing this ticket and opening a new ticket for the FileSystem Log and reporting issue.

You should get a few emails in short succession: one for the close of this ticket, one for the opening of the new ticket, and one more from the new ticket that will include the scheduling link.

Thank you,
