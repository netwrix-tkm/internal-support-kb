"00aQk0000095w2zIAA","500Qk00000Do5t6IAB","We reviewed the NC group in today's meeting and discovered it was using the wrong server. We removed the old server, added the new one, and rerun the scan. The new scan showed a different error: ""Host process was terminated (DC did not abort timely)""
Alex will contact the server administrator to confirm that the service account has the necessary permission to scan the server.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-09-13T20:00:16.000Z","2024-09-13T20:00:16.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk0000098cSjIAI","500Qk00000Do5t6IAB","We rename the T2 database folder for the NC. 
We discovered NC did not have the proxy assigned, so we added the proxy to the query.
The scan will start 6 hours after Ph≈ìnix to ensure it is not running simultaneously as Phoenix.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-09-16T23:10:01.000Z","2024-09-16T23:10:01.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000009CypdIAC","500Qk00000Do5t6IAB","In the last meeting, we renamed the ""UKBRT-FS03.BSH.AEXP.COM"" from the FSAA folder, and we also renamed the one from the proxy server.
For the Permission scan we discovered that Require applet was not selected; we fixed that.
We also discovered it was in local mode, so we switched it and added the proxy.
 
We set it up to run a zero-level scan, and Alex will increase the folder depth when the scan is completed.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-09-19T23:27:48.000Z","2024-09-19T23:27:48.000Z","false","false"
