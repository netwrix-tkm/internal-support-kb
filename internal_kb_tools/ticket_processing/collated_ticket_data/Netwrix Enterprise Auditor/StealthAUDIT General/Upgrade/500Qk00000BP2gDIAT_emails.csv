I did receive the link but I think it would be best to wait until we are done with stl4amcaud10 and bel4amcaud10 so we can get a change window for it. Let me check with the team what they think. Thank you.

Hi Scottie, hope you are well. With the jobs taking so long to be completed, the team has decided to postpone this upgrade for the production servers until this issue is resolved. I will most likely cancel this call in the morning. Thank you.

Hello Scottie, 

 

I did receive the link but I think it would be best to wait until we are done with stl4amcaud10 and bel4amcaud10 so we can get a change window for it. Let me check with the team what they think. Thank you.

Hi Scottie, hope you are well. With the jobs taking so long to be completed, the team has decided to postpone this upgrade for the production servers until this issue is resolved. I will most likely cancel this call in the morning. Thank you.

Hello Scottie, 

 

I did receive the link but I think it would be best to wait until we are done with stl4amcaud10 and bel4amcaud10 so we can get a change window for it. Let me check with the team what they think. Thank you.

Hi Scottie,

We are pretty sure we fixed the issue we discussed the other day; we are going to monitor until EOD tomorrow to be sure. But then we would want to proceed with upgrade. I would say right now I am aiming for July 9th at the latest to do this!

Hi Scottie,

 

We are pretty sure we fixed the issue we discussed the other day; we are going to monitor until EOD tomorrow to be sure. But then we would want to proceed with upgrade. I would say right now I am aiming for July 9th at the latest to do this!

Hello Scottie, 

 

I did receive the link but I think it would be best to wait until we are done with stl4amcaud10 and bel4amcaud10 so we can get a change window for it. Let me check with the team what they think. Thank you.

Hello Scottie, 

 

I did receive the link but I think it would be best to wait until we are done with stl4amcaud10 and bel4amcaud10 so we can get a change window for it. Let me check with the team what they think. Thank you.

Hi Scottie,

 

We are pretty sure we fixed the issue we discussed the other day; we are going to monitor until EOD tomorrow to be sure. But then we would want to proceed with upgrade. I would say right now I am aiming for July 9th at the latest to do this!

Hi Scottie,

 

Hope you are well. Thank you for the update. Sounds good! I couldn’t join the meeting this morning because of another call with different vendor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into the issue with the team today. I know it wasn’t planned so thank you again!

Hello Scottie, 

 

I did receive the link but I think it would be best to wait until we are done with stl4amcaud10 and bel4amcaud10 so we can get a change window for it. Let me check with the team what they think. Thank you.

Hi Paige,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Performed an upgrade of the NEA application on both the stl2 and bel2 servers. Successfully upgraded the Unix jobs and verified that the global settings were carried over. I will put this ticket in postponed reply until Thursday to allow for validation of the jobs and settings.

Please let me know if you run into any errors with the application.

Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

We are pretty sure we fixed the issue we discussed the other day; we are going to monitor until EOD tomorrow to be sure. But then we would want to proceed with upgrade. I would say right now I am aiming for July 9th at the latest to do this!

Hello Scottie,

I did receive the link but I think it would be best to wait until we are done with stl4amcaud10 and bel4amcaud10 so we can get a change window for it. Let me check with the team what they think. Thank you.

Hi Paige,

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Performed an upgrade of the NEA application on both the stl2 and bel2 servers. Successfully upgraded the Unix jobs and verified that the global settings were carried over. I will put this ticket in postponed reply until Thursday to allow for validation of the jobs and settings. 

Please let me know if you run into any errors with the application.

Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

 

We are pretty sure we fixed the issue we discussed the other day; we are going to monitor until EOD tomorrow to be sure. But then we would want to proceed with upgrade. I would say right now I am aiming for July 9th at the latest to do this!

 

Thanks,
