Hello Bradley,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the certificate errors you were seeing in the FSAA scan.
We also looked into the errors that were being thrown by the Sharepoint scans.
I was able to speak with our internal teams and they have confirmed what we were speaking about, this should be a warning and not an error.

At this point I will be opening a new ticket to open up a change request to get this fixed in future versions to make sure its labeled as a warning and not an error. You don't need to do anything on that ticket as it is only going to exist to make the change request and it will be closed immediately after I get a request number.

As for this case, since the scans seem to be working, if you have no objections I'd like to close the upgrade ticket as there are no outstanding issues relating to the upgrade unless you have any other questions about it.


Our next steps are:
I will:
Open a ticket to ask for the change request on the error labeling.



Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

There are no firewalls at all, on the Netapp or between you server and the Netapp.

Hello Bradley,

Yes, you can just move those back into the folder you want them in. You will have to close the console > move the files > re-open the console to get it to reflect properly.

Thank you,

Ian,

Regarding the upgrade of our Dev StealthAudit application, I noticed that some of the sharePoint Report job folder under the SharePoint reports got move to the parent folder.

Can I just move all the sharepont report jobs back to the ‘Reporting’ foldfer? 

 

We backup the job folder:   here is before and after the upgrade.

 

Before upgrade – the way is used to be…





 

 

After upgrade

Hello Bradley,

I spoke with Jared and he mentioned you would like to do the upgrade for the Dev environment tomorrow.
I do have the availability but you'll need to book quickly as it will be tight. Below are two links, the first is to schedule the preflight, I would suggest selecting the earliest time you can. The second is for the upgrade, it will be a 90 minute meeting and will only fit into the 5PM EST time slot so we'll need to make sure the pre flight is before that.

Preflight

Upgrade
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=OYFvVByjpIAULcC8qDDVmVMyTqhwnr6iVDtUYXXEs1k-Z&MeetingID=PLRL04oJ5tnhPndTF33ehevkHPc9ViTkn6tNWHp_Xrw-Z

Hello Bradley,

Yes, you can just move those back into the folder you want them in. You will have to close the console > move the files > re-open the console to get it to reflect properly.

Thank you,

Ian,
Regarding the upgrade of our Dev StealthAudit application, I noticed that some of the sharePoint Report job folder under the SharePoint reports got move to the parent folder.
Can I just move all the sharepont report jobs back to the 'Reporting' foldfer?

We backup the job folder:   here is before and after the upgrade.

Before upgrade - the way is used to be...

Hello Bradley,

I spoke with Jared and he mentioned you would like to do the upgrade for the Dev environment tomorrow.
I do have the availability but you'll need to book quickly as it will be tight. Below are two links, the first is to schedule the preflight, I would suggest selecting the earliest time you can. The second is for the upgrade, it will be a 90 minute meeting and will only fit into the 5PM EST time slot so we'll need to make sure the pre flight is before that.

Preflight

Upgrade
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=OYFvVByjpIAULcC8qDDVmVMyTqhwnr6iVDtUYXXEs1k-Z&MeetingID=PLRL04oJ5tnhPndTF33ehevkHPc9ViTkn6tNWHp_Xrw-Z

Hello Bradley,

I wanted to follow up on this issue.
Since we have corrected the file structure of your sharepoint jobs and they are working, I have opened a separate request for the error you were seeing as it should be a warning.
Would you be ok if we closed this ticket out now while we focus on the Netapp issues, or is there any other questions remaining around the upgrade I can help with?

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Bradley,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the certificate errors you were seeing in the FSAA scan.
We also looked into the errors that were being thrown by the Sharepoint scans.
I was able to speak with our internal teams and they have confirmed what we were speaking about, this should be a warning and not an error.

At this point I will be opening a new ticket to open up a change request to get this fixed in future versions to make sure its labeled as a warning and not an error. You don't need to do anything on that ticket as it is only going to exist to make the change request and it will be closed immediately after I get a request number.

As for this case, since the scans seem to be working, if you have no objections I'd like to close the upgrade ticket as there are no outstanding issues relating to the upgrade unless you have any other questions about it.


Our next steps are:
I will:
Open a ticket to ask for the change request on the error labeling.



Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian & Paul,

Here are the screenshots for the ‘validate firewall’ settings, as requested.

 

 

----

Bradley,

There are no firewalls at all, on the Netapp or between you server and the Netapp.

I have sent the evidence before but here it is again.

Hello Bradley,

Yes, you can just move those back into the folder you want them in. You will have to close the console > move the files > re-open the console to get it to reflect properly.

Thank you,

Ian,

Regarding the upgrade of our Dev StealthAudit application, I noticed that some of the sharePoint Report job folder under the SharePoint reports got move to the parent folder.

Can I just move all the sharepont report jobs back to the ‘Reporting’ foldfer? 

 

We backup the job folder:   here is before and after the upgrade.

 

Before upgrade – the way is used to be…





 

 

After upgrade

Hello Bradley,

I spoke with Jared and he mentioned you would like to do the upgrade for the Dev environment tomorrow.
I do have the availability but you'll need to book quickly as it will be tight. Below are two links, the first is to schedule the preflight, I would suggest selecting the earliest time you can. The second is for the upgrade, it will be a 90 minute meeting and will only fit into the 5PM EST time slot so we'll need to make sure the pre flight is before that.

Preflight
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=KNDFf2od6X.1P3Jq0.Wi06KUeTLOa3dpV1MMP4E_GtU-Z&MeetingID=VKVMjn4dqG8idsBeSJrcomJWv2Js4fZp4uoIJ9NpRVo-Z

Upgrade
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=OYFvVByjpIAULcC8qDDVmVMyTqhwnr6iVDtUYXXEs1k-Z&MeetingID=PLRL04oJ5tnhPndTF33ehevkHPc9ViTkn6tNWHp_Xrw-Z

The list looks like its mostly FSAA and FSAC scans using the proxy, did these errors return after the changes that Paul made on Friday?

Hello Bradley,

I wanted to follow up on this issue.
Since we have corrected the file structure of your sharepoint jobs and they are working, I have opened a separate request for the error you were seeing as it should be a warning.
Would you be ok if we closed this ticket out now while we focus on the Netapp issues, or is there any other questions remaining around the upgrade I can help with?

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Bradley,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the certificate errors you were seeing in the FSAA scan.
We also looked into the errors that were being thrown by the Sharepoint scans.
I was able to speak with our internal teams and they have confirmed what we were speaking about, this should be a warning and not an error.

At this point I will be opening a new ticket to open up a change request to get this fixed in future versions to make sure its labeled as a warning and not an error. You don't need to do anything on that ticket as it is only going to exist to make the change request and it will be closed immediately after I get a request number.

As for this case, since the scans seem to be working, if you have no objections I'd like to close the upgrade ticket as there are no outstanding issues relating to the upgrade unless you have any other questions about it.


Our next steps are:
I will:
Open a ticket to ask for the change request on the error labeling.



Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian & Paul,
Here are the screenshots for the 'validate firewall' settings, as requested.

Bradley,
There are no firewalls at all, on the Netapp or between you server and the Netapp.
I have sent the evidence before but here it is again.

Yes, you can just move those back into the folder you want them in. You will have to close the console > move the files > re-open the console to get it to reflect properly.

Thank you,

Ian,
Regarding the upgrade of our Dev StealthAudit application, I noticed that some of the sharePoint Report job folder under the SharePoint reports got move to the parent folder.
Can I just move all the sharepont report jobs back to the 'Reporting' foldfer?

We backup the job folder:   here is before and after the upgrade.

Before upgrade - the way is used to be...

Hello Bradley,

I spoke with Jared and he mentioned you would like to do the upgrade for the Dev environment tomorrow.
I do have the availability but you'll need to book quickly as it will be tight. Below are two links, the first is to schedule the preflight, I would suggest selecting the earliest time you can. The second is for the upgrade, it will be a 90 minute meeting and will only fit into the 5PM EST time slot so we'll need to make sure the pre flight is before that.

Preflight

Upgrade

The FSAC job error is a legacy table that doesn't exist anymore, we'll need to look at the job to see if we can replace it with a newer job that does not look for that table.
The other errors are the proxy server error's we've been working on for ticket 00438031. I'm happy to close out either 00438031 or this ticket but right now it looks like we have two tickets for the same issue.
I think we should probably keep 00438031 since it does have the notes for the work we've done with Paul, but I'm happy to keep this ticket open instead if you'd prefer that.

Thank you,

Hello Bradley,

The list looks like its mostly FSAA and FSAC scans using the proxy, did these errors return after the changes that Paul made on Friday?

Hello Bradley,

I wanted to follow up on this issue.
Since we have corrected the file structure of your sharepoint jobs and they are working, I have opened a separate request for the error you were seeing as it should be a warning.
Would you be ok if we closed this ticket out now while we focus on the Netapp issues, or is there any other questions remaining around the upgrade I can help with?

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Bradley,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the certificate errors you were seeing in the FSAA scan.
We also looked into the errors that were being thrown by the Sharepoint scans.
I was able to speak with our internal teams and they have confirmed what we were speaking about, this should be a warning and not an error.

At this point I will be opening a new ticket to open up a change request to get this fixed in future versions to make sure its labeled as a warning and not an error. You don't need to do anything on that ticket as it is only going to exist to make the change request and it will be closed immediately after I get a request number.

As for this case, since the scans seem to be working, if you have no objections I'd like to close the upgrade ticket as there are no outstanding issues relating to the upgrade unless you have any other questions about it.


Our next steps are:
I will:
Open a ticket to ask for the change request on the error labeling.



Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian & Paul,

Here are the screenshots for the ‘validate firewall’ settings, as requested.

 

 

----

Bradley,

There are no firewalls at all, on the Netapp or between you server and the Netapp.

I have sent the evidence before but here it is again.

Hello Bradley,

Yes, you can just move those back into the folder you want them in. You will have to close the console > move the files > re-open the console to get it to reflect properly.

Thank you,

Ian,

Regarding the upgrade of our Dev StealthAudit application, I noticed that some of the sharePoint Report job folder under the SharePoint reports got move to the parent folder.

Can I just move all the sharepont report jobs back to the ‘Reporting’ foldfer? 

 

We backup the job folder:   here is before and after the upgrade.

 

Before upgrade – the way is used to be…





 

 

After upgrade

Hello Bradley,

I spoke with Jared and he mentioned you would like to do the upgrade for the Dev environment tomorrow.
I do have the availability but you'll need to book quickly as it will be tight. Below are two links, the first is to schedule the preflight, I would suggest selecting the earliest time you can. The second is for the upgrade, it will be a 90 minute meeting and will only fit into the 5PM EST time slot so we'll need to make sure the pre flight is before that.

Preflight

Upgrade
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=OYFvVByjpIAULcC8qDDVmVMyTqhwnr6iVDtUYXXEs1k-Z&MeetingID=PLRL04oJ5tnhPndTF33ehevkHPc9ViTkn6tNWHp_Xrw-Z

Hello Bradley,

The FSAC job error is a legacy table that doesn't exist anymore, we'll need to look at the job to see if we can replace it with a newer job that does not look for that table.
The other errors are the proxy server error's we've been working on for ticket 00438031. I'm happy to close out either 00438031 or this ticket but right now it looks like we have two tickets for the same issue.
I think we should probably keep 00438031 since it does have the notes for the work we've done with Paul, but I'm happy to keep this ticket open instead if you'd prefer that.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Bradley,

I wanted to follow up on this issue.
Since we have corrected the file structure of your sharepoint jobs and they are working, I have opened a separate request for the error you were seeing as it should be a warning.
Would you be ok if we closed this ticket out now while we focus on the Netapp issues, or is there any other questions remaining around the upgrade I can help with?

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Bradley,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the certificate errors you were seeing in the FSAA scan.
We also looked into the errors that were being thrown by the Sharepoint scans.
I was able to speak with our internal teams and they have confirmed what we were speaking about, this should be a warning and not an error.

At this point I will be opening a new ticket to open up a change request to get this fixed in future versions to make sure its labeled as a warning and not an error. You don't need to do anything on that ticket as it is only going to exist to make the change request and it will be closed immediately after I get a request number.

As for this case, since the scans seem to be working, if you have no objections I'd like to close the upgrade ticket as there are no outstanding issues relating to the upgrade unless you have any other questions about it.


Our next steps are:
I will:
Open a ticket to ask for the change request on the error labeling.



Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian & Paul,
Here are the screenshots for the 'validate firewall' settings, as requested.

Bradley,
There are no firewalls at all, on the Netapp or between you server and the Netapp.
I have sent the evidence before but here it is again.

Hello Bradley,

Yes, you can just move those back into the folder you want them in. You will have to close the console > move the files > re-open the console to get it to reflect properly.

Thank you,

Ian,
Regarding the upgrade of our Dev StealthAudit application, I noticed that some of the sharePoint Report job folder under the SharePoint reports got move to the parent folder.
Can I just move all the sharepont report jobs back to the 'Reporting' foldfer?

We backup the job folder:   here is before and after the upgrade.

Before upgrade - the way is used to be...

Hello Bradley,

I spoke with Jared and he mentioned you would like to do the upgrade for the Dev environment tomorrow.
I do have the availability but you'll need to book quickly as it will be tight. Below are two links, the first is to schedule the preflight, I would suggest selecting the earliest time you can. The second is for the upgrade, it will be a 90 minute meeting and will only fit into the 5PM EST time slot so we'll need to make sure the pre flight is before that.

Preflight

Upgrade

Hello Bradley,

The FSAC job error is a legacy table that doesn't exist anymore, we'll need to look at the job to see if we can replace it with a newer job that does not look for that table.
The other errors are the proxy server error's we've been working on for ticket 00438031. I'm happy to close out either 00438031 or this ticket but right now it looks like we have two tickets for the same issue.
I think we should probably keep 00438031 since it does have the notes for the work we've done with Paul, but I'm happy to keep this ticket open instead if you'd prefer that.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello Bradley,

The list looks like its mostly FSAA and FSAC scans using the proxy, did these errors return after the changes that Paul made on Friday?

Hello Bradley,

I wanted to follow up on this issue.
Since we have corrected the file structure of your sharepoint jobs and they are working, I have opened a separate request for the error you were seeing as it should be a warning.
Would you be ok if we closed this ticket out now while we focus on the Netapp issues, or is there any other questions remaining around the upgrade I can help with?

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Bradley,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the certificate errors you were seeing in the FSAA scan.
We also looked into the errors that were being thrown by the Sharepoint scans.
I was able to speak with our internal teams and they have confirmed what we were speaking about, this should be a warning and not an error.

At this point I will be opening a new ticket to open up a change request to get this fixed in future versions to make sure its labeled as a warning and not an error. You don't need to do anything on that ticket as it is only going to exist to make the change request and it will be closed immediately after I get a request number.

As for this case, since the scans seem to be working, if you have no objections I'd like to close the upgrade ticket as there are no outstanding issues relating to the upgrade unless you have any other questions about it.


Our next steps are:
I will:
Open a ticket to ask for the change request on the error labeling.



Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian & Paul,

Here are the screenshots for the ‘validate firewall’ settings, as requested.

Bradley,

There are no firewalls at all, on the Netapp or between you server and the Netapp.

I have sent the evidence before but here it is again.

Hello Bradley,

Yes, you can just move those back into the folder you want them in. You will have to close the console > move the files > re-open the console to get it to reflect properly.

Thank you,

Ian,

Regarding the upgrade of our Dev StealthAudit application, I noticed that some of the sharePoint Report job folder under the SharePoint reports got move to the parent folder.

Can I just move all the sharepont report jobs back to the ‘Reporting’ foldfer? 

 

We backup the job folder:   here is before and after the upgrade.

 

Before upgrade – the way is used to be…





 

 

After upgrade

Hello Bradley,

I spoke with Jared and he mentioned you would like to do the upgrade for the Dev environment tomorrow.
I do have the availability but you'll need to book quickly as it will be tight. Below are two links, the first is to schedule the preflight, I would suggest selecting the earliest time you can. The second is for the upgrade, it will be a 90 minute meeting and will only fit into the 5PM EST time slot so we'll need to make sure the pre flight is before that.

Preflight
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=KNDFf2od6X.1P3Jq0.Wi06KUeTLOa3dpV1MMP4E_GtU-Z&MeetingID=VKVMjn4dqG8idsBeSJrcomJWv2Js4fZp4uoIJ9NpRVo-Z

Upgrade
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=OYFvVByjpIAULcC8qDDVmVMyTqhwnr6iVDtUYXXEs1k-Z&MeetingID=PLRL04oJ5tnhPndTF33ehevkHPc9ViTkn6tNWHp_Xrw-Z

Hello Bradley,

The FSAC job error is a legacy table that doesn't exist anymore, we'll need to look at the job to see if we can replace it with a newer job that does not look for that table.
The other errors are the proxy server error's we've been working on for ticket 00438031. I'm happy to close out either 00438031 or this ticket but right now it looks like we have two tickets for the same issue.
I think we should probably keep 00438031 since it does have the notes for the work we've done with Paul, but I'm happy to keep this ticket open instead if you'd prefer that.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

The list looks like its mostly FSAA and FSAC scans using the proxy, did these errors return after the changes that Paul made on Friday?

Hello Bradley,

I wanted to follow up on this issue.
Since we have corrected the file structure of your sharepoint jobs and they are working, I have opened a separate request for the error you were seeing as it should be a warning.
Would you be ok if we closed this ticket out now while we focus on the Netapp issues, or is there any other questions remaining around the upgrade I can help with?

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Bradley,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the certificate errors you were seeing in the FSAA scan.
We also looked into the errors that were being thrown by the Sharepoint scans.
I was able to speak with our internal teams and they have confirmed what we were speaking about, this should be a warning and not an error.

At this point I will be opening a new ticket to open up a change request to get this fixed in future versions to make sure its labeled as a warning and not an error. You don't need to do anything on that ticket as it is only going to exist to make the change request and it will be closed immediately after I get a request number.

As for this case, since the scans seem to be working, if you have no objections I'd like to close the upgrade ticket as there are no outstanding issues relating to the upgrade unless you have any other questions about it.


Our next steps are:
I will:
Open a ticket to ask for the change request on the error labeling.



Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian & Paul,
Here are the screenshots for the 'validate firewall' settings, as requested.

Bradley,
There are no firewalls at all, on the Netapp or between you server and the Netapp.
I have sent the evidence before but here it is again.

Hello Bradley,

Yes, you can just move those back into the folder you want them in. You will have to close the console > move the files > re-open the console to get it to reflect properly.

Ian,
Regarding the upgrade of our Dev StealthAudit application, I noticed that some of the sharePoint Report job folder under the SharePoint reports got move to the parent folder.
Can I just move all the sharepont report jobs back to the 'Reporting' foldfer?

We backup the job folder:   here is before and after the upgrade.

Before upgrade - the way is used to be...

Hello Bradley,

I spoke with Jared and he mentioned you would like to do the upgrade for the Dev environment tomorrow.
I do have the availability but you'll need to book quickly as it will be tight. Below are two links, the first is to schedule the preflight, I would suggest selecting the earliest time you can. The second is for the upgrade, it will be a 90 minute meeting and will only fit into the 5PM EST time slot so we'll need to make sure the pre flight is before that.

Preflight

Upgrade

I would think so, but its difficult for me to confirm without looking at the job since I don't have a lab that references that table any longer.
We would probably want to replace the entire job though, not just the analysis section as there may be other changes in it as well.

Thank you,

I found this analysis job, that references that table.   Is this the legacy job you were referring to?

 

“Unusual user activity”

the file is a .txt with the sql script of the job.

Hello Bradley,

The FSAC job error is a legacy table that doesn't exist anymore, we'll need to look at the job to see if we can replace it with a newer job that does not look for that table.
The other errors are the proxy server error's we've been working on for ticket 00438031. I'm happy to close out either 00438031 or this ticket but right now it looks like we have two tickets for the same issue.
I think we should probably keep 00438031 since it does have the notes for the work we've done with Paul, but I'm happy to keep this ticket open instead if you'd prefer that.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Bradley,

The list looks like its mostly FSAA and FSAC scans using the proxy, did these errors return after the changes that Paul made on Friday?

Hello Bradley,

I wanted to follow up on this issue.
Since we have corrected the file structure of your sharepoint jobs and they are working, I have opened a separate request for the error you were seeing as it should be a warning.
Would you be ok if we closed this ticket out now while we focus on the Netapp issues, or is there any other questions remaining around the upgrade I can help with?

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Bradley,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the certificate errors you were seeing in the FSAA scan.
We also looked into the errors that were being thrown by the Sharepoint scans.
I was able to speak with our internal teams and they have confirmed what we were speaking about, this should be a warning and not an error.

At this point I will be opening a new ticket to open up a change request to get this fixed in future versions to make sure its labeled as a warning and not an error. You don't need to do anything on that ticket as it is only going to exist to make the change request and it will be closed immediately after I get a request number.

As for this case, since the scans seem to be working, if you have no objections I'd like to close the upgrade ticket as there are no outstanding issues relating to the upgrade unless you have any other questions about it.


Our next steps are:
I will:
Open a ticket to ask for the change request on the error labeling.



Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian & Paul,

Here are the screenshots for the ‘validate firewall’ settings, as requested.

Bradley,

There are no firewalls at all, on the Netapp or between you server and the Netapp.

I have sent the evidence before but here it is again.

Hello Bradley,

Yes, you can just move those back into the folder you want them in. You will have to close the console > move the files > re-open the console to get it to reflect properly.

Ian,

Regarding the upgrade of our Dev StealthAudit application, I noticed that some of the sharePoint Report job folder under the SharePoint reports got move to the parent folder.

Can I just move all the sharepont report jobs back to the ‘Reporting’ foldfer? 

 

We backup the job folder:   here is before and after the upgrade.

 

Before upgrade – the way is used to be…





 

 

After upgrade

Hello Bradley,

I spoke with Jared and he mentioned you would like to do the upgrade for the Dev environment tomorrow.
I do have the availability but you'll need to book quickly as it will be tight. Below are two links, the first is to schedule the preflight, I would suggest selecting the earliest time you can. The second is for the upgrade, it will be a 90 minute meeting and will only fit into the 5PM EST time slot so we'll need to make sure the pre flight is before that.

Preflight

Upgrade

I’m still struggling with the Proxy cert issue on the Netapp jobs that use the proxy server.   I’m rescheduling the jobs so they don’t overlap.

 

How do I get rid of this error when scanning for Sensitive Data on SharePoint?

The SharePoint Sensitive Data scan jobs have this error.

 

[C:18] Error querying Resource(SiteCollection|3|EverBank Intranet).ISharePointList Error:Field or property ""IsSystemList"" does not exist.

Ok

Next steps, I have requested 2 new Dev servers to replace to two current dev StealthAudit servers. Once I receive the new servers, I will open a 'dev migration' ticket so you and I can move the 11.6 version in dev to a new set of servers.

  *   The goal is to simulate how we will migrate production which is to migrate 11.5 from server 2016 to server 2022.
  *   Also see if the 2 new dev servers will clear the certificate errors we are now getting on all Netapp jobs using the proxy server.
  *   Hopefully, we can eliminate these other errors we are getting and stabilize the Dev solution.

Is there anything else I might be missing that needs to be done?

Hello Bradley,


Can you confirm that's in one of your netapp scans?
The message is cosmetic and has no impact on anything, I'll open a ticket though as I think there is some discussion going into what causes this message currently.

Hello Bradley,

I'll have to look into if that error can be removed.
It looks like we're trying to get properties from different objects, and some of those objects don't have certain values tied to them. When this happens we return this error. I don't know that we'd be able to remove the error without excluding those objects from being scanned, but I will look into it.

Thank you,

That all looks correct to me, you'll just want to ensure that the new servers are ready per the documentation.

I also noticed that the netapp ticket was closed today. Did you manage to find out what was causing the connectivity problem, and if possible could you share the details so I can add it to the notes so far?

We may still have issues after upgrading the Dev StealthAudit.

 

The SharePoint Sensitive Data scan jobs have this error.

Thank you for the requirements link. I'll send a request for a meeting once I receive the new servers.

The resolution to the Activity Monitor not able to connect to the Netapp on either port 80 or 443, was the Netapp vendor support assisted to delete a certificate that was preventing connectivity on port 443.   Once the cert was removed, the Activity Monitor now connects on port 443 in Dev.   (even thought production connects on port 80).

I will work on trying to get production changed from port 80 to 443.

Hello Bradley,

That all looks correct to me, you'll just want to ensure that the new servers are ready per the documentation.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Overview.htm

I also noticed that the netapp ticket was closed today. Did you manage to find out what was causing the connectivity problem, and if possible could you share the details so I can add it to the notes so far?

Ok

Next steps, I have requested 2 new Dev servers to replace to two current dev StealthAudit servers. Once I receive the new servers, I will open a 'dev migration' ticket so you and I can move the 11.6 version in dev to a new set of servers.

  1.  The goal is to simulate how we will migrate production which is to migrate 11.5 from server 2016 to server 2022.
  2.  Also see if the 2 new dev servers will clear the certificate errors we are now getting on all Netapp jobs using the proxy server.
  3.  Hopefully, we can eliminate these other errors we are getting and stabilize the Dev solution.

Is there anything else I might be missing that needs to be done?

Hello Bradley,


Can you confirm that's in one of your netapp scans?
The message is cosmetic and has no impact on anything, I'll open a ticket though as I think there is some discussion going into what causes this message currently.

Hello Bradley,

I'll have to look into if that error can be removed.
It looks like we're trying to get properties from different objects, and some of those objects don't have certain values tied to them. When this happens we return this error. I don't know that we'd be able to remove the error without excluding those objects from being scanned, but I will look into it.

Thank you,

I'm still struggling with the Proxy cert issue on the Netapp jobs that use the proxy server.   I'm rescheduling the jobs so they don't overlap.

How do I get rid of this error when scanning for Sensitive Data on SharePoint?

[C:25] Error querying Resource(SiteCollection|3|EverBank Intranet).ISharePointList Error:Field or property ""IsSystemList"" does not exist.

Hello Bradley,

I wanted to make sure there are no new errors we need to open tickets for, before we close this upgrade ticket again.
Can you please confirm that there are no new errors we need to investigate? If there are new errors, can you please provide them so I can open tickets for them.

Thank you,

That looks to be the same error that we agreed should be a warning and opened an enhancement request for.
Is there some error it is causing in the scan?

Thanks for the confirmation on that netapp issue.
When you are ready for the migration open up a new ticket with us and we can send a meeting invite to help get the migration underway.

I am opening a new ticket for the error ""Unable to retrieve account domain from server ATNETAPP01_LL.DEVUS.LOCAL:  1337 Invalid SID. : The security ID structure is invalid""

Hello Bradley,





Can you confirm that's in one of your netapp scans?
The message is cosmetic and has no impact on anything, I'll open a ticket though as I think there is some discussion going into what causes this message currently.




Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello Bradley,

I'll have to look into if that error can be removed.
It looks like we're trying to get properties from different objects, and some of those objects don't have certain values tied to them. When this happens we return this error. I don't know that we'd be able to remove the error without excluding those objects from being scanned, but I will look into it.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

I’m still struggling with the Proxy cert issue on the Netapp jobs that use the proxy server.   I’m rescheduling the jobs so they don’t overlap.

 

How do I get rid of this error when scanning for Sensitive Data on SharePoint?

 

[C:25] Error querying Resource(SiteCollection|3|EverBank Intranet).ISharePointList Error:Field or property ""IsSystemList"" does not exist.

Hello Bradley,

I wanted to make sure there are no new errors we need to open tickets for, before we close this upgrade ticket again.
Can you please confirm that there are no new errors we need to investigate? If there are new errors, can you please provide them so I can open tickets for them.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Bradley,

That looks to be the same error that we agreed should be a warning and opened an enhancement request for.
Is there some error it is causing in the scan?

Thank you,

Ian,

We may still have issues after upgrading the Dev StealthAudit.

 

The SharePoint Sensitive Data scan jobs have this error.

 

[C:18] Error querying Resource(SiteCollection|3|EverBank Intranet).ISharePointList Error:Field or property ""IsSystemList"" does not exist.
