Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
Before upgrading to 12.0, I suggest you upgrade to 11.6 and make sure everything is working. After successfully upgrading to 11.6, you can upgrade to 12.0.
 
Yes, we do have a KB article for the upgrade, but we strongly advise having a Netwrix engineer guide you through it step by step.
 
11.5 to 11.6 upgrade
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm
 
11.6 to 12.0 upgrade
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/Wizard.htm
 
We strongly advise before upgrading, you take a full snapshot of both servers (StealthAUDIT and SQL)
 
Since you are on 11.5, we can have a preflight meeting to review your current settings, take screenshots, and discuss the upgrade.
 
If you want me to schedule the preflight meeting, please reply to this email and let me know.
 
Thanks,

Hi Frantz,

Thanks for the documentation. I think that’ll suffice, we’ll try it at some point. You can close the case.

Thanks,
Gill

Ticket Number: 00441473
Ticket Subject: How to upgrade to 12.0
Ticket Details: Hi, is there a guide available on how to upgrade from 11.5 to 12.0? We are currently on 11.5.1332.890. We use threat prevention, threat manager, and FSAA but not sure if those tie in with sealthaudit. Our current instance is an EC2 instance and the DB is on a RDS instance.

Thank you!
