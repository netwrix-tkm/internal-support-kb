Thank You for the update, I was out of the office on Friday and I just got to this email.

Looking at the case folder and attachments it looks like the images did not make it.

This ticket was for the upgrade I'll look at our other case to see if they just crossed streams.

Please let me know if any additional assistance is needed for this case.

Jack,

I wanted to follow up to see if we are good to close out the upgraded case and shift focus back to the FSAA/FSAC scan case?

Please let me know.

Again, thank You for your time.

 Jack,,

Thank You for the update, I was out of the office on Friday and I just got to this email.

Looking at the case folder and attachments it looks like the images did not make it.

This ticket was for the upgrade I'll look at our other case to see if they just crossed streams.

Please let me know if any additional assistance is needed for this case.

Again, thank You for your time.

Hey Dusty!

I actually just sent a response as I received this email so bit of funny timing.  Just want to make sure you got it since it had pictures attached to it.

Best,
Jack
