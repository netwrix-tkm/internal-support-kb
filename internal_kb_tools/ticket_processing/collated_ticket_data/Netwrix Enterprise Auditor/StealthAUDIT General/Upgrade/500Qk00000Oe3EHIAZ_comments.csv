@Michael Burrofato @Sanjay Meghani @Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer: 
Went through the logs, images and the tasks. This looks like an enumeration issue. Would like to request for ""FileSystem"" group folder present under ""Jobs"" folder in the install folder.

@Michael Burrofato @Sanjay Meghani @Benjamin Warren @Salesforce
Next steps for this ticket would either be to have the
customer search the Job folder in Windows File Explorer for the jobs shown in
the error message such as “FSAA_BulkImport221” from Image2 of the artifacts and
provide a screenshot of the results. Or schedule a call with dev to investigate
the job tree.
