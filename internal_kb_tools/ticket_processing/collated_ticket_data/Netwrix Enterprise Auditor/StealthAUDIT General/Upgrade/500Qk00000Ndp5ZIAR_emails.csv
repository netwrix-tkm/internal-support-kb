Hi Dusty,

I worked with our DBA after the call, we verified that the account we used had DBA to all the Netwrix DB's.  When I went into settings to validate the DB config and select the DB, we got the error:

[cid:image001.png@01DBADD3.06FCD820]

I clicked OK and then clicked Apply, it appeared to work based on these results.
[cid:image002.png@01DBADD3.621A7F50]

I closed and saved the config and then ran the create schema job, but it still failed - it ran up to around 120 of 132 tasks in the 1. Create Tables analysis job and failed and also failed the Data Migration Task.

Our DBA then gave me SA rights so I went in and ran the same steps.  This time I did not get the error selecting the DB, but got the below option.  I selected the default and click OK.
[cid:image003.png@01DBADD4.B530AE20]

It finished the transfer, so I click Finish.
[cid:image004.png@01DBADD4.B530AE20]


I then got the errors below as I click through the OK's.
[cid:image005.png@01DBADD5.1EA0DE20]
[cid:image006.png@01DBADD5.1EA0DE20]
[cid:image007.png@01DBADD5.1EA0DE20]

I ran the schema job and again failed with the same errors.

We looked in the DB tables, but we did not see the SA_FSAA_AzureFilesShares.ResourceID table that was being referenced in the error.  I have also attached the log from the job.

Thanks,
Gary

Hi Dusty,

 

We have our AUDIT and AIC servers broken out in Prod so the Audit scans wouldn’t impact the Prod AIC stuff. This is the way we have it set up in test as well.

Hi Dusty,

 

I worked with our DBA after the call, we verified that the account we used had DBA to all the Netwrix DB’s.  When I went into settings to validate the DB config and select the DB, we got the error:

 



 

I clicked OK and then clicked Apply, it appeared to work based on these results.



 

I closed and saved the config and then ran the create schema job, but it still failed – it ran up to around 120 of 132 tasks in the 1. Create Tables analysis job and failed and also failed the Data Migration Task.

 

Our DBA then gave me SA rights so I went in and ran the same steps.  This time I did not get the error selecting the DB, but got the below option.  I selected the default and click OK.



 

It finished the transfer, so I click Finish.



 

 

I then got the errors below as I click through the OK’s.







 

I ran the schema job and again failed with the same errors.

 

We looked in the DB tables, but we did not see the SA_FSAA_AzureFilesShares.ResourceID table that was being referenced in the error.  I have also attached the log from the job.

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hi Dusty,

I went out to the site and noticed there is a new release as of 4/14 - I download that and will run it to see if it changes anything.
I also met with our DBA after the call, famadmin was still explicitly added to the DB.  He ran the script and while I didn't get the error from the DB drop down, the schema job still failed.
When we run the job there is nothing that comes up in the logs but when he looked, it appears the tables get created but the dropped

Thanks,
Gary

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Ndp5Z:ref


Hi Dusty,

I worked with our DBA after the call, we verified that the account we used had DBA to all the Netwrix DB's.  When I went into settings to validate the DB config and select the DB, we got the error:

[cid:image001.png@01DBAEBF.C35DC2D0]

I clicked OK and then clicked Apply, it appeared to work based on these results.
[cid:image002.png@01DBAEBF.C35DC2D0]

I closed and saved the config and then ran the create schema job, but it still failed - it ran up to around 120 of 132 tasks in the 1. Create Tables analysis job and failed and also failed the Data Migration Task.

Our DBA then gave me SA rights so I went in and ran the same steps.  This time I did not get the error selecting the DB, but got the below option.  I selected the default and click OK.
[cid:image003.png@01DBAEBF.C35DC2D0]

It finished the transfer, so I click Finish.
[cid:image004.png@01DBAEBF.C35DC2D0]


I then got the errors below as I click through the OK's.
[cid:image005.png@01DBAEBF.C35DC2D0]
[cid:image006.png@01DBAEBF.C35DC2D0]
[cid:image007.png@01DBAEBF.C35DC2D0]

I ran the schema job and again failed with the same errors.

We looked in the DB tables, but we did not see the SA_FSAA_AzureFilesShares.ResourceID table that was being referenced in the error.  I have also attached the log from the job.

Thanks,
Gary

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Ndp5Z:ref

Hi Dusty,

 

I went out to the site and noticed there is a new release as of 4/14 – I download that and will run it to see if it changes anything. 

I also met with our DBA after the call, famadmin was still explicitly added to the DB.  He ran the script and while I didn’t get the error from the DB drop down, the schema job still failed.

When we run the job there is nothing that comes up in the logs but when he looked, it appears the tables get created but the dropped

 

Thanks,

Gary

Team,

Per our call today we tested other options to try and get to the root of the 0-Create Schema Could not create constraint or index issue for the new Netwrix Access Analyzer (NAA) 12.0.0.1053 install/upgrade.

This morning, we ran a repair and then reran the ""%SAInstallDir%StealthAUDIT.EXE"" /Upgrade
    This was post re-running the PowerShell command and checking that the installer was not Blocked Get-ChildItem ""PATH TO THE INSTALLER"" -Recurse |Unblock-File 

Unfortunately the Console returned the same error(s).

Ran my SA_AIC_Core_troubleshooting and collected the MIS installer logs for review.  << Pulling them now.

Will have the DBA add the account back explicitly to the need DB as well as run the following per the Guide to correct the Error messages from the Global Storage settings.
USE [master]GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO [<SA User ID>]
GO

Again, thank You for your time.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Ndp5Z:ref

 

Hi Dusty,

 

I worked with our DBA after the call, we verified that the account we used had DBA to all the Netwrix DB’s.  When I went into settings to validate the DB config and select the DB, we got the error:

 

[Inline image name : image001.png]

 

I clicked OK and then clicked Apply, it appeared to work based on these results.

[Inline image name : image002.png]

 

I closed and saved the config and then ran the create schema job, but it still failed – it ran up to around 120 of 132 tasks in the 1. Create Tables analysis job and failed and also failed the Data Migration Task.

 

Our DBA then gave me SA rights so I went in and ran the same steps.  This time I did not get the error selecting the DB, but got the below option.  I selected the default and click OK.

[Inline image name : image003.png]

 

It finished the transfer, so I click Finish.

[Inline image name : image004.png]

 

 

I then got the errors below as I click through the OK’s.

[Inline image name : image005.png]

[Inline image name : image006.png]

[Inline image name : image007.png]

 

I ran the schema job and again failed with the same errors.

 

We looked in the DB tables, but we did not see the SA_FSAA_AzureFilesShares.ResourceID table that was being referenced in the error.  I have also attached the log from the job.

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hi Dusty,

 

I went out to the site and noticed there is a new release as of 4/14 – I download that and will run it to see if it changes anything. 

I also met with our DBA after the call, famadmin was still explicitly added to the DB.  He ran the script and while I didn’t get the error from the DB drop down, the schema job still failed.

When we run the job there is nothing that comes up in the logs but when he looked, it appears the tables get created but the dropped

 

Thanks,

Gary

Team,

Per our call today we tested other options to try and get to the root of the 0-Create Schema Could not create constraint or index issue for the new Netwrix Access Analyzer (NAA) 12.0.0.1053 install/upgrade.

This morning, we ran a repair and then reran the ""%SAInstallDir%StealthAUDIT.EXE"" /Upgrade
    This was post re-running the PowerShell command and checking that the installer was not Blocked Get-ChildItem ""PATH TO THE INSTALLER"" -Recurse |Unblock-File 

Unfortunately the Console returned the same error(s).

Ran my SA_AIC_Core_troubleshooting and collected the MIS installer logs for review.  << Pulling them now.

Will have the DBA add the account back explicitly to the need DB as well as run the following per the Guide to correct the Error messages from the Global Storage settings.
USE [master]GRANT VIEW ANY  DEFINITION TO [<SA User ID>]
GO

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,

 

I worked with our DBA after the call, we verified that the account we used had DBA to all the Netwrix DB’s.  When I went into settings to validate the DB config and select the DB, we got the error:

 



 

I clicked OK and then clicked Apply, it appeared to work based on these results.



 

I closed and saved the config and then ran the create schema job, but it still failed – it ran up to around 120 of 132 tasks in the 1. Create Tables analysis job and failed and also failed the Data Migration Task.

 

Our DBA then gave me SA rights so I went in and ran the same steps.  This time I did not get the error selecting the DB, but got the below option.  I selected the default and click OK.



 

It finished the transfer, so I click Finish.



 

 

I then got the errors below as I click through the OK’s.







 

I ran the schema job and again failed with the same errors.

 

We looked in the DB tables, but we did not see the SA_FSAA_AzureFilesShares.ResourceID table that was being referenced in the error.  I have also attached the log from the job.

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hi Dusty,

 

We have our AUDIT and AIC servers broken out in Prod so the Audit scans wouldn’t impact the Prod AIC stuff. This is the way we have it set up in test as well.

Hi Dusty,

I went out to the site and noticed there is a new release as of 4/14 - I download that and will run it to see if it changes anything.
I also met with our DBA after the call, famadmin was still explicitly added to the DB.  He ran the script and while I didn't get the error from the DB drop down, the schema job still failed.
When we run the job there is nothing that comes up in the logs but when he looked, it appears the tables get created but the dropped

Thanks,
Gary

Team,

Per our call today we tested other options to try and get to the root of the 0-Create Schema Could not create constraint or index issue for the new Netwrix Access Analyzer (NAA) 12.0.0.1053 install/upgrade.

This morning, we ran a repair and then reran the ""%SAInstallDir%StealthAUDIT.EXE"" /Upgrade
    This was post re-running the PowerShell command and checking that the installer was not Blocked Get-ChildItem ""PATH TO THE INSTALLER"" -Recurse |Unblock-File

Unfortunately the Console returned the same error(s).

Ran my SA_AIC_Core_troubleshooting and collected the MIS installer logs for review.  << Pulling them now.

Will have the DBA add the account back explicitly to the need DB as well as run the following per the Guide to correct the Error messages from the Global Storage settings.
USE [master]GRANT VIEW ANY DEFINITION TO [<SA User ID>]
GO

Again, thank You for your time.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000Ndp5Z:ref


Hi Dusty,

I worked with our DBA after the call, we verified that the account we used had DBA to all the Netwrix DB's.  When I went into settings to validate the DB config and select the DB, we got the error:

[cid:image001.png@01DBAF71.D13AD2A0]

I clicked OK and then clicked Apply, it appeared to work based on these results.
[cid:image002.png@01DBAF71.D13AD2A0]

I closed and saved the config and then ran the create schema job, but it still failed - it ran up to around 120 of 132 tasks in the 1. Create Tables analysis job and failed and also failed the Data Migration Task.

Our DBA then gave me SA rights so I went in and ran the same steps.  This time I did not get the error selecting the DB, but got the below option.  I selected the default and click OK.
[cid:image003.png@01DBAF71.D13AD2A0]

It finished the transfer, so I click Finish.
[cid:image004.png@01DBAF71.D13AD2A0]


I then got the errors below as I click through the OK's.
[cid:image005.png@01DBAF71.D13AD2A0]
[cid:image006.png@01DBAF71.D13AD2A0]
[cid:image007.png@01DBAF71.D13AD2A0]

I ran the schema job and again failed with the same errors.

We looked in the DB tables, but we did not see the SA_FSAA_AzureFilesShares.ResourceID table that was being referenced in the error.  I have also attached the log from the job.

Thanks,
Gary

Hi Dusty,

 

I went out to the site and noticed there is a new release as of 4/14 – I download that and will run it to see if it changes anything. 

I also met with our DBA after the call, famadmin was still explicitly added to the DB.  He ran the script and while I didn’t get the error from the DB drop down, the schema job still failed.

When we run the job there is nothing that comes up in the logs but when he looked, it appears the tables get created but the dropped

 

Thanks,

Gary

Team,

Per our call today we tested other options to try and get to the root of the 0-Create Schema Could not create constraint or index issue for the new Netwrix Access Analyzer (NAA) 12.0.0.1053 install/upgrade.

This morning, we ran a repair and then reran the ""%SAInstallDir%StealthAUDIT.EXE"" /Upgrade
    This was post re-running the PowerShell command and checking that the installer was not Blocked Get-ChildItem ""PATH TO THE INSTALLER"" -Recurse |Unblock-File 

Unfortunately the Console returned the same error(s).

Ran my SA_AIC_Core_troubleshooting and collected the MIS installer logs for review.  << Pulling them now.

Will have the DBA add the account back explicitly to the need DB as well as run the following per the Guide to correct the Error messages from the Global Storage settings.
USE [master]GRANT VIEW ANY  DEFINITION TO [<SA User ID>]
GO

Again, thank You for your time.

Hi Dusty,

 

I worked with our DBA after the call, we verified that the account we used had DBA to all the Netwrix DB’s.  When I went into settings to validate the DB config and select the DB, we got the error:

 



 

I clicked OK and then clicked Apply, it appeared to work based on these results.



 

I closed and saved the config and then ran the create schema job, but it still failed – it ran up to around 120 of 132 tasks in the 1. Create Tables analysis job and failed and also failed the Data Migration Task.

 

Our DBA then gave me SA rights so I went in and ran the same steps.  This time I did not get the error selecting the DB, but got the below option.  I selected the default and click OK.



 

It finished the transfer, so I click Finish.



 

 

I then got the errors below as I click through the OK’s.







 

I ran the schema job and again failed with the same errors.

 

We looked in the DB tables, but we did not see the SA_FSAA_AzureFilesShares.ResourceID table that was being referenced in the error.  I have also attached the log from the job.

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hi Dusty,

 

We have our AUDIT and AIC servers broken out in Prod so the Audit scans wouldn’t impact the Prod AIC stuff. This is the way we have it set up in test as well.
