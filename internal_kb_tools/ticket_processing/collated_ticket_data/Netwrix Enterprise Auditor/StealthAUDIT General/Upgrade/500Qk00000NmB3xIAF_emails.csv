Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Upgraded your Netwrix Access Analyzer and Access Information center to version 12.0

We replaced the AIC certificate binding with the new certificate and we added single sign on to your reporting console.

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved. The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.
