I see, this is indicative of installation issues. I will be back with the next steps soon. Please attempt to re-install the application and make sure to unblock the installer in Right Click > Properties, and let me know if that helped.

Hi Ilya,



There is no file is the ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITReports"" location."

Please make sure that this is not present on the installation file: 



And also could you run the installation file using PowerShell that has been run as Domain Admin?

This might help, if not - I'll try to provide the missing files.

Ziyaad,

Please make sure that this is not present on the installation file:

[cid:image001.png@01DAC252.25551250]

And also could you run the installation file using PowerShell that has been run as Domain Admin?

This might help, if not - I'll try to provide the missing files.

This might help, if not - I'll try to provide the missing files.

I see, this is indicative of installation issues. I will be back with the next steps soon. Please attempt to re-install the application and make sure to unblock the installer in Right Click > Properties, and let me know if that helped.

Ziyaad,

I see, this is indicative of installation issues. I will be back with the next steps soon. Please attempt to re-install the application and make sure to unblock the installer in Right Click > Properties, and let me know if that helped.

We do not have Domain Admin credentials and the customer will not provide them as it was done with local admin during the POC.

Ziyaad,

Please make sure that this is not present on the installation file:

[cid:image001.png@01DAC257.3BC35010]

And also could you run the installation file using PowerShell that has been run as Domain Admin?

This might help, if not - I'll try to provide the missing files.

Hi Ilya,



There is no file is the ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITReports"" location."
"02sQk00000BVRlaIAH","500Qk00000BlNpGIAV","2024-06-19T13:01:24.000Z","2024-06-19T13:01:24.000Z","Ziyaad,

These actions force the product to regenerate the files that are necessary for the reporting system. Yours did not generate properly when installing/upgrading the core application.

Ziyaad,

Follow these instructions:
1. Open Task Manager and end all NEA instances/processes.
2. Open NEA
3. Check the folder, the file reports.xml should be created now
4. Right click the Jobs > Publish and choose the reports to publish

Hi Ilya,

 

We do not have Domain Admin credentials and the customer will not provide them as it was done with local admin during the POC.

 

Can you please send us the files.

Ziyaad,

We will need to book a meeting in advance, unfortunately. Please attempt the installation from PowerShell as Domain Admin, if it fails - let me know, and, as I've said, I'll send you the files.

Hi Ilya,

 

We do not see the unblock option.

 

Are you available right now to jump on a call as we have the customer online with us and access to the system?

Ziyaad,

Please make sure that this is not present on the installation file: 



And also could you run the installation file using PowerShell that has been run as Domain Admin?

This might help, if not - I'll try to provide the missing files.

Ziyaad,

These actions force the product to regenerate the files that are necessary for the reporting system. Yours did not generate properly when installing/upgrading the core application.

Follow these instructions:
1. Open Task Manager and end all NEA instances/processes.
2. Open NEA
3. Check the folder, the file reports.xml should be created now
4. Right click the Jobs > Publish and choose the reports to publish

Hi Ilya,

We do not have Domain Admin credentials and the customer will not provide them as it was done with local admin during the POC.

Can you please send us the files.

Ziyaad,

We will need to book a meeting in advance, unfortunately. Please attempt the installation from PowerShell as Domain Admin, if it fails - let me know, and, as I've said, I'll send you the files.

Hi Ilya,

We do not see the unblock option.

Are you available right now to jump on a call as we have the customer online with us and access to the system?

Ziyaad,

Please make sure that this is not present on the installation file:

[cid:image001.png@01DAC2A7.B90BB490]

And also could you run the installation file using PowerShell that has been run as Domain Admin?

This might help, if not - I'll try to provide the missing files.

Ziyaad,

I see, this is indicative of installation issues. I will be back with the next steps soon. Please attempt to re-install the application and make sure to unblock the installer in Right Click > Properties, and let me know if that helped.
