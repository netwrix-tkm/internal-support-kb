they were having an issue with NEA console crashing with a .NET error (clp.dll) when trying to load the query configuration pop-up

rebooting fixed the issue, for now, but they have had this problem in the past

NAA 12.0 requires .NET 8
the client will install .NET 8 before the upgrade meeting tomorrow

FSAA scans in local mode
no proxies
no SDD

upgrade complete to 12.0.0.1070

FSAA Create Schema job fails now
fails to create new tables and fails data migration

gathered logs

---------------

The NAA console is running very slow after upgrading
clicking on any job takes several seconds to populate the data in the console

This has been seen in other 12.0 upgrades as well
