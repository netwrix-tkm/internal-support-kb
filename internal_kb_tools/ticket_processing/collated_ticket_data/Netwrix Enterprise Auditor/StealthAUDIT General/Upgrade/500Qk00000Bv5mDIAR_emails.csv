I think leave it open, please!  These lines in the link you sent do not fill me with confidence that I will know how to do it correctly 😊

 

NOTE: If any customizations have been done by a Netwrix Engineer, please ensure the custom work is not lost during the upgrade process. While using the Upgrade Wizard, customizations are archived prior to solution upgrades. These archives are available after the solution upgrades have been completed. Contact Netwrix Support for additional information.

CAUTION: The new global Settings will overwrite any previously configured Sensitive Data criteria. Make a note of any configured Sensitive Data Criteria before upgrading Enterprise Auditor. Sensitive Data Criteria must be reconfigured after an upgrade. See the Configure Global Sensitive Data Settings topic for additional information.

 

We have customisations and Sensitive Data  criteria that have been added.

I think leave it open, please!  These lines in the link you sent do not fill me with confidence that I will know how to do it correctly 😊


NOTE: If any customizations have been done by a Netwrix Engineer, please ensure the custom work is not lost during the upgrade process. While using the Upgrade Wizard, customizations are archived prior to solution upgrades. These archives are available after the solution upgrades have been completed. Contact Netwrix Support<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.netwrix.com/support.html__;!!GDyMDYbfvpeH7A!UDhUGj_McEcFrxCNkoTcycfZiSQz5v677KfRFPhMcW9Eomifi49Sdq9niLg_Ea1c2MaLBT2fGxiuP5ROmR6yT2IC86M$> for additional information.

CAUTION: The new global Settings will overwrite any previously configured Sensitive Data criteria. Make a note of any configured Sensitive Data Criteria before upgrading Enterprise Auditor. Sensitive Data Criteria must be reconfigured after an upgrade. See the Configure Global Sensitive Data Settings<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Upgrade/SolutionConsiderations.htm*Configur__;Iw!!GDyMDYbfvpeH7A!UDhUGj_McEcFrxCNkoTcycfZiSQz5v677KfRFPhMcW9Eomifi49Sdq9niLg_Ea1c2MaLBT2fGxiuP5ROmR6yEVHJoFU$> topic for additional information.

We have customisations and Sensitive Data  criteria that have been added.

I think leave it open, please!  These lines in the link you sent do not fill me with confidence that I will know how to do it correctly 😊

 

NOTE: If any customizations have been done by a Netwrix Engineer, please ensure the custom work is not lost during the upgrade process. While using the Upgrade Wizard, customizations are archived prior to solution upgrades. These archives are available after the solution upgrades have been completed. Contact Netwrix Support for additional information.

CAUTION: The new global Settings will overwrite any previously configured Sensitive Data criteria. Make a note of any configured Sensitive Data Criteria before upgrading Enterprise Auditor. Sensitive Data Criteria must be reconfigured after an upgrade. See the Configure Global Sensitive Data Settings topic for additional information.

 

We have customisations and Sensitive Data  criteria that have been added.

Ok -  thanks  Ilya.  The warnings implied the user criteria would have to be “noted”  and reapplied after the upgrade (I have ot say I don’t remember doing that before,  but you guys have always doen the upgrades before!)
