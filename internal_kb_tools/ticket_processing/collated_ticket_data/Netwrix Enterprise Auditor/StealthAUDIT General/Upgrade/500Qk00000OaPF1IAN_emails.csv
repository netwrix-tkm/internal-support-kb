Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help. You are likely already familiar with our two-meeting process for upgrading Netwrix Access Analyzer (formally Netwrix Enterprise Auditor). The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and to gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade. As with any upgrade, we recommend taking a backup or snapshot shortly before the upgrade. 

Please use the following links to schedule the 2 meetings. Please make the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=7EkFpo5miMgi2TRZEDlcemm5bnd_6yNjN1G8OLiPEdo-Z&MeetingID=_Xo9n6OxQkqne_0jRK3zb7FypdNJzwz1YptRoQbp3mw-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=vzdIVjyN7B3GwYiF78_N9MtP31o5NNcFcpJ8bErKzKE-Z&MeetingID=THPA7n2cCQun5wadFAXZN1dX9.ekuwjk7Vo8g5NTX5s-Z

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton
Technical Support Engineer Tier 1
