Dhruman,

Per our call today we again noted the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA)                11.6.0.79
Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC)    11.6.0.15
Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM)                 7.0.3135          To include the 2 Agent host.

We had to rebuild the Agent connection to the DRProd host to be able to update the NAM console to clear the Warning.

Created a BU_ folder under the FileSystem install path to remove all the duplicate jobs.

Confirmed the FileSystem job settings for the 2 file servers.

Scheduled out the FileSystem job(s) to run as needed.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA)                11.6.0.79
Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC)    11.6.0.15
Netwrix Activity Monitor (NAM)                 7.0.3135          To include the 2 Agent host.

We had to rebuild the Agent connection to the DRProd host to be able to update the NAM console to clear the Warning.

Created a BU_ folder under the FileSystem install path to remove all the duplicate jobs.

Confirmed the FileSystem job settings for the 2 file servers.

Scheduled out the FileSystem job(s) to run as needed.

Please let me know how the next set of scans complete.
