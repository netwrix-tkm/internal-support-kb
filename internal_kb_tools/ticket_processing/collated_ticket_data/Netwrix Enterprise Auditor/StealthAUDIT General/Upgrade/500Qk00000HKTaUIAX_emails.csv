Dusty, 

                I know that we set the schedule to upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to this Friday at 8AM Central Time. 

                I wonder if we can move it to the next Monday 11/4/2024 at 8AM Central Time? 

                We do have a CAB – Change Control process internally, and I have to get the approval from leadership team.    

 

Thank you,

Bao Luu.

Good morning Dusty,
                After our upgradation on Monday with the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, we did kick the Active Directory scan, and the scan is still running for like 48 hours, and still running. Before, it would take really quickly to run the scan. I wonder if you can help. I upload the log and the screenshot for the long scan in this email.
                Please review and lets me know what you think.

Thank you,
Bao Luu.

Good morning Dusty, 

                After our upgradation on Monday with the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, we did kick the Active Directory scan, and the scan is still running for like 48 hours, and still running. Before, it would take really quickly to run the scan. I wonder if you can help. I upload the log and the screenshot for the long scan in this email. 

                Please review and lets me know what you think. 

 

Thank you,

Bao Luu.

Dusty, 

                I know that we set the schedule to upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to this Friday at 8AM Central Time. 

                I wonder if we can move it to the next Monday 11/4/2024 at 8AM Central Time? 

                We do have a CAB – Change Control process internally, and I have to get the approval from leadership team.    

 

Thank you,

Bao Luu.

Good morning Dusty,
                You could be correct. Because we did set the 6.Activity every at 1AM, and the following day, a whole Active Directory group running as well. I did kill the long scan job, and everything ran thru after. Furthermore, I did kick the job running again earlier this morning, it went thru the stuck scan.
                Here is the picture of the database properties.

Good morning Dusty, 

                You could be correct. Because we did set the 6.Activity every at 1AM, and the following day, a whole Active Directory group running as well. I did kill the long scan job, and everything ran thru after. Furthermore, I did kick the job running again earlier this morning, it went thru the stuck scan. 

                Here is the picture of the database properties. 



                 

 

Thank you,

Bao Luu.

Could we also confirm that the Recovery model is set to Simple?

Good morning Dusty, 

                After our upgradation on Monday with the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, we did kick the Active Directory scan, and the scan is still running for like 48 hours, and still running. Before, it would take really quickly to run the scan. I wonder if you can help. I upload the log and the screenshot for the long scan in this email. 

                Please review and lets me know what you think. 

 

Thank you,

Bao Luu.

Dusty, 

                I know that we set the schedule to upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to this Friday at 8AM Central Time. 

                I wonder if we can move it to the next Monday 11/4/2024 at 8AM Central Time? 

                We do have a CAB – Change Control process internally, and I have to get the approval from leadership team.    

 

Thank you,

Bao Luu.

If none could we be conflicting with another process on the SQL host like a backup? Will need to have your DBA confirm.

Could we also confirm that the Recovery model is set to Simple?

Good morning Dusty,
                After our upgradation on Monday with the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, we did kick the Active Directory scan, and the scan is still running for like 48 hours, and still running. Before, it would take really quickly to run the scan. I wonder if you can help. I upload the log and the screenshot for the long scan in this email.
                Please review and lets me know what you think.

Thank you,
Bao Luu.

Dusty,
                I know that we set the schedule to upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to this Friday at 8AM Central Time.
                I wonder if we can move it to the next Monday 11/4/2024 at 8AM Central Time?
                We do have a CAB - Change Control process internally, and I have to get the approval from leadership team.

Thank you,
Bao Luu.
