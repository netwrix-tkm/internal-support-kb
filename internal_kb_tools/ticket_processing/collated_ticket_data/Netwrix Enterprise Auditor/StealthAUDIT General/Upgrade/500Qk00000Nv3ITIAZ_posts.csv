I need assistance with collecting sensitive data on my file server. I'm able to successfully collect activity, permissions, and other general information. However, when it comes to sensitive data, the application encounters several errors.

In the ""SEEK System Scans"" job, I receive the following message:
<a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA</a>.AppletDeployment | No need to scan, Tier 2 DB USN is greater than Tier 1 DB USN, needs bulk import.
Based on the documentation, I unchecked the two boxes under the query in ""Scan Settings"" — ""Restart Incomplete Scans after"" and ""Rescan unimported hosts after"" — but the same error persists. I also tried changing the hosts, using the local server, and selecting all hosts, but none of these approaches worked.

In the ""SEEK Bulk Import"" job, which should be running, I consistently get the following error:
Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAABulkImportProcess | Sequence contains no elements.
I’ve attempted changing the hosts here as well, but the issue remains the same.

Note: I recently upgraded Netwrix Access Analyzer to version 12.0, and I couldn’t find the Sensitive Data Discovery module in this version.

Could you please assist me with this case? I’ve attached the error logs generated in the output folders for your review.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Gustavo Rossato","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-10T17:48:04.000Z"
