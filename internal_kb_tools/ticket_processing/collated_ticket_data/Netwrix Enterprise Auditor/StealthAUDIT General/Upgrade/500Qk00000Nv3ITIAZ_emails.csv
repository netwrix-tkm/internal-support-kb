After setting ""Restart Incomplete Scans after"" and ""Rescan unimported hosts after"" to 0, the ""SEEK System Scans"" job now completes successfully. However, when running the Bulk Import job, I still encounter the same error:

Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAABulkImportProcess | Sequence contains no elements.

Looking forward to your response.

Ticket Number: 00441641
Ticket Subject: AIQON | Assistance Required for Sensitive Data Collection on File Server
Ticket Details: Hello,

I need assistance with collecting sensitive data on my file server. I'm able to successfully collect activity, permissions, and other general information. However, when it comes to sensitive data, the application encounters several errors.

In the ""SEEK System Scans"" job, I receive the following message:
<a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA</a>.AppletDeployment | No need to scan, Tier 2 DB USN is greater than Tier 1 DB USN, needs bulk import.
Based on the documentation, I unchecked the two boxes under the query in ""Scan Settings"" — ""Restart Incomplete Scans after"" and ""Rescan unimported hosts after"" — but the same error persists. I also tried changing the hosts, using the local server, and selecting all hosts, but none of these approaches worked.

In the ""SEEK Bulk Import"" job, which should be running, I consistently get the following error:
Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAABulkImportProcess | Sequence contains no elements.
I’ve attempted changing the hosts here as well, but the issue remains the same.

Note: I recently upgraded Netwrix Access Analyzer to version 12.0, and I couldn’t find the Sensitive Data Discovery module in this version.

Could you please assist me with this case? I’ve attached the error logs generated in the output folders for your review.

Thank you in advance.

Gustavo Rossato

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, I repaired the affected hos and performed a 0-level scan, which was completed successfully.
I ran the unlimited scan as you set it up, and it was completed successfully.
I ran the Bulk Import scan, and it was completed successfully.
 
Concerning the issue with the Sensitive Data, we may have to run a repair.
When did you upgrade to 12.0?
Did you have a Netwrix engineer with you during the upgrade, or did you upgrade to 12.0 by yourself?

Hello,

Apologies for the delayed response.

About a month ago, we independently upgraded from Netwrix Enterprise
Auditor 11.6 to Netwrix Access Analyser 12.0.

It's important to note that we had not tested the Sensitive Data
functionality prior to the upgrade, so we are unable to determine whether
the issue is related to the upgrade or was pre-existing.

Best regards,

Thank you for your reply.
Let's try a repair first to see if that resolves the issue with the Sensitive Data. If it does not, we will probably have to reinstall.
 
Please use the link below to schedule the meeting.

Hello,

Apologies for the delayed response.

About a month ago, we independently upgraded from Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6 to Netwrix Access Analyser 12.0.

It's important to note that we had not tested the Sensitive Data functionality prior to the upgrade, so we are unable to determine whether the issue is related to the upgrade or was pre-existing.

Best regards,

Hi Gustavo,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, I repaired the affected hos and performed a 0-level scan, which was completed successfully.
I ran the unlimited scan as you set it up, and it was completed successfully.
I ran the Bulk Import scan, and it was completed successfully.
 
Concerning the issue with the Sensitive Data, we may have to run a repair.
When did you upgrade to 12.0?
Did you have a Netwrix engineer with you during the upgrade, or did you upgrade to 12.0 by yourself?
 
Thanks,

Hello!

Unfortunately, we were unable to find a suitable time in our schedules for this month. With that in mind, we would like to propose rescheduling our meeting for next month instead.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Hello Gustavo,

I’m following up on my previous email with the scheduling availability link, as I haven’t seen a meeting scheduled yet.

If you need me to resend the link or if you have any questions, please feel free to reply to this email.

Looking forward to connecting with you!

Ticket Number: 00441641
Ticket Subject: AIQON | Assistance Required for Sensitive Data Collection on File Server
Ticket Details: Hello,

I need assistance with collecting sensitive data on my file server. I'm able to successfully collect activity, permissions, and other general information. However, when it comes to sensitive data, the application encounters several errors.

In the ""SEEK System Scans"" job, I receive the following message:
<a href='https://Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA' target='_blank'>Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAA</a>.AppletDeployment | No need to scan, Tier 2 DB USN is greater than Tier 1 DB USN, needs bulk import.
Based on the documentation, I unchecked the two boxes under the query in ""Scan Settings"" — ""Restart Incomplete Scans after"" and ""Rescan unimported hosts after"" — but the same error persists. I also tried changing the hosts, using the local server, and selecting all hosts, but none of these approaches worked.

In the ""SEEK Bulk Import"" job, which should be running, I consistently get the following error:
Netwrix.CoordinationLibrary.Processes.FSAABulkImportProcess | Sequence contains no elements.
I’ve attempted changing the hosts here as well, but the issue remains the same.

Note: I recently upgraded Netwrix Access Analyzer to version 12.0, and I couldn’t find the Sensitive Data Discovery module in this version.

Could you please assist me with this case? I’ve attached the error logs generated in the output folders for your review.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Gustavo Rossato

Thank you!
