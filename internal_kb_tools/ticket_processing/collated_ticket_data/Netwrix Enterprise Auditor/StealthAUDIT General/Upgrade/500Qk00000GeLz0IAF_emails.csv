I'm just following up. This ticket is specifically for upgrading NEA, the AIC, and the FS Proxy service. All three of those were upgraded successfully in our last meeting. We only encountered issue with the upgrade of Netwrix Activity Monitor. That upgrade, and its problems with connecting to your Nasuni servers, has its own ticket, 00423204, and has already been escalated to development. 

I believe this NEA, AIC, and FS Proxy upgrade ticket is good to close, but I wanted to confirm with you first. Please let me know if you have encountered any post-upgrade issues with NEA, the AIC, or the FS Proxy Service and if you are comfortable closing this ticket.

Thank you,

Hello Chad,

Thank you for meeting with me and Tay yesterday. In our session we successfully upgraded Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, the AIC, and the FSProxy service; however, we were unable to upgrade Netwrix Activity Monitor. Despite our best efforts, we could not get the new version to connect to your Nasuni filers.

We are using ticket 00423204 for the Netwrix Activity Monitor upgrade. Tay has already spoken with our developers and is in the process of escalating that ticket. Futher comunication regarding that issue should come through that other ticket. This ticket is strictly for the upgrades that we did complete yesterday.

Please give it a couple days to make sure everything is still working as you expect. Let me know if you have any issues or questions and if you are comfortable closing this ticket.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton

Hello Chad,

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we completed the pre-flight reference gathering and configuration backup. I recorded a video of the meeting in Teams in lieu of multiple screen shots. Thank you for bearing the tedium of clicking through so many menus.

The next step is a 90-minute upgrade meeting. Please use this link to schedule:

Hello Chad,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help.

Upgrading StealthAUDIT (now called Netwrix Enterprise Auditor) is a 2-step, 2-meeting process. The first is a 45-minute preflight meeting where we get an idea of the makeup of your deployment (Licensed solutions, number of proxies, AIC, etc.) and take a number of screenshots and backup files of your current configuration and job tree. If everything goes smoothly, we will only need some of these files to verify the configuration after the upgrade. We will not be making any changes in this meeting.

The second meeting is a 90-minute meeting in which we actually perform the upgrade. This should give us enough time to upgrade NEA, the AIC, and Netwrix Activity Monitor. I recommend taking a snapshot of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor shortly before this meeting, if possible.

------------------------------
Here is a link to schedule the 45-minute preflight meeting:

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=.y8nCV0q0Y37iJ5QfT5.4VCADELhPrvg.jjBE_F_eWc-Z&MeetingID=NebFPr0Q5bA9KL3k7T1krvRW59oGkrt36dL9.aablR4-Z
------------------------------

We won't need them until the second meeting, but you can download all of the necessary installers on the My Products page on our customer portal: My Products (netwrix.com)

You'll want to download the Version 11.6 files for the following:

	Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Management Platform
	Sensitive Data Discovery
	Access Information Center


And if you are using one or more proxy servers to collect File System permissions, you'll also need

	FSAA Proxy



Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,
