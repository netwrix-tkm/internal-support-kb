"00aQk000008vqenIAA","500Qk00000Do5YBIAZ","We performed the preflight process for StealthAudit to prepare for the official upgrade to NEA and its associated web applications. This included taking screenshots of your global settings and backing up job configuration data.

We also discussed updating your SSL certificate through IIS and how this process will change moving forward, using an admin command prompt. 

We discussed the process of updating password credentials for the service account that's used for all StealthAudit applications. I have provided that documentation below: 

Update Credential Passwords (netwrix.com)

We also discussed the steps required on the day of the upgrade which include performing a full backup of the database, snapshots of the application server, and verifying that no scheduled tasks are running or will run during the upgrade process.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-09-05T15:48:28.000Z","2024-09-05T15:48:28.000Z","false","false"

We identified that the scan did not have enough space to update the tier 1 database because of a storage capacity issue on the SQL server. 

We recommend adding more space to the SQL server before upgrading and verifying that the scheduled tasks can successfully run after the additional SQL storage space.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-09-17T16:13:14.000Z","2024-09-17T16:13:14.000Z","false","false"

Resolved the LogOn User error presented below:

Screenshot 2024-10-18 102233

This error was resolved by signing in as the service account on the application server and performing the installation process as expected. 

We also updated the SSL certificate bindings for the AIC and the Published Reports console by using the process presented in the documentation below:

Securing the Access Information Center

We then verified that we could access the AIC and the Published Reports web console using the friendly names associated with the SSL certificate. We were successfully able to access both web consoles

Our next steps are:

You will:

Verify that there aren't any additional issues associated with the upgrade and installation of the NEA application and its components. Then provide an update by next Monday.
