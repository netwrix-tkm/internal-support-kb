Hi Josh,

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

Hi Josh,

 

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

 

-Karoline

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=57GgZwJM8xljxzN2SaypuZDFrv4MRwYbHxV5TcsjANQ-Z&MeetingID=ode0CTAY4b6cP772MSbPFnzjjOE0s0PCmdHer8NfRJ0-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=gVMXRRoE1mYWCxx9xjQet1OKPesp2_i57K3JvwCIZqw-Z&MeetingID=XtL_FUYcUSo6gUlGvvkng_5m2OqeauLlGxgCxaYZM9k-Z


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Hi Josh,

 

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

 

-Karoline

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=57GgZwJM8xljxzN2SaypuZDFrv4MRwYbHxV5TcsjANQ-Z&MeetingID=ode0CTAY4b6cP772MSbPFnzjjOE0s0PCmdHer8NfRJ0-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=gVMXRRoE1mYWCxx9xjQet1OKPesp2_i57K3JvwCIZqw-Z&MeetingID=XtL_FUYcUSo6gUlGvvkng_5m2OqeauLlGxgCxaYZM9k-Z


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Hi Josh,

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):

Hi Mike,

I apologize for sending this so close to the meeting. Would you be able to meet tomorrow and Friday to take the screenshots and do the upgrade? My day is completely open on Friday except for a 10:30 so I can be flexible with your schedule.

Thank you advance,

Hi Josh,

 

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

 

-Karoline

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=57GgZwJM8xljxzN2SaypuZDFrv4MRwYbHxV5TcsjANQ-Z&MeetingID=ode0CTAY4b6cP772MSbPFnzjjOE0s0PCmdHer8NfRJ0-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=gVMXRRoE1mYWCxx9xjQet1OKPesp2_i57K3JvwCIZqw-Z&MeetingID=XtL_FUYcUSo6gUlGvvkng_5m2OqeauLlGxgCxaYZM9k-Z


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Hi Mike,

Thank you for following up.  I put some comments below. Additionally our AD_SCAN job keeps getting errors. We worked yesterday with the CyberArk team to make sure the Hash file was updated but we are still getting the error messages. I included a screenshot below of the messages.

Hi Karoline,

Here is a summary of our meeting today and next steps:

+++++
2025_0418 Meeting:
+++++
1) Successfully upgraded to NEA v 11.6.0.141
2) TO DO: Could not install AIC 11.6.0.37 because we did not have the password for the Windows Account = ""StealthID"".
              I got details on how to get this password, they can reset it for us so I have a password when we go to set it up. I am still waiting confirmation on how to do this.

3) TO DO: Could not get the NEA Reporting Module working because we did not have an SSL CERT assigned to/for the NEA Application server.  (certmgr)
              I have to request the cert still but it’s a short process, after I request it I will be able to install it.



Thank you,
Mike Candon

Hi Josh,

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.

Hi Mike,

 

Thank you for following up.  I put some comments below. Additionally our AD_SCAN job keeps getting errors. We worked yesterday with the CyberArk team to make sure the Hash file was updated but we are still getting the error messages. I included a screenshot below of the messages.

Hi Karoline,

Here is a summary of our meeting today and next steps:

+++++
2025_0418 Meeting:
+++++
1) Successfully upgraded to NEA v 11.6.0.141
2) TO DO: Could not install AIC 11.6.0.37 because we did not have the password for the Windows Account = ""StealthID"".

              I got details on how to get this password, they can reset it for us so I have a password when we go to set it up. I am still waiting confirmation on how to do this. 


3) TO DO: Could not get the NEA Reporting Module working because we did not have an SSL CERT assigned to/for the NEA Application server.  (certmgr)

              I have to request the cert still but it’s a short process, after I request it I will be able to install it. 




Thank you,

Hi Mike, 

 

I apologize for sending this so close to the meeting. Would you be able to meet tomorrow and Friday to take the screenshots and do the upgrade? My day is completely open on Friday except for a 10:30 so I can be flexible with your schedule. 

 

Thank you advance,

Hi Mike,

 

Thank you for following up.  I put some comments below. Additionally our AD_SCAN job keeps getting errors. We worked yesterday with the CyberArk team to make sure the Hash file was updated but we are still getting the error messages. I included a screenshot below of the messages.

Hi Karoline,

Here is a summary of our meeting today and next steps:

+++++
2025_0418 Meeting:
+++++
1) Successfully upgraded to NEA v 11.6.0.141
2) TO DO: Could not install AIC 11.6.0.37 because we did not have the password for the Windows Account = ""StealthID"".

              I got details on how to get this password, they can reset it for us so I have a password when we go to set it up. I am still waiting confirmation on how to do this. 


3) TO DO: Could not get the NEA Reporting Module working because we did not have an SSL CERT assigned to/for the NEA Application server.  (certmgr)

              I have to request the cert still but it’s a short process, after I request it I will be able to install it. 




Thank you,

Hi Mike, 

 

I apologize for sending this so close to the meeting. Would you be able to meet tomorrow and Friday to take the screenshots and do the upgrade? My day is completely open on Friday except for a 10:30 so I can be flexible with your schedule. 

 

Thank you advance,

Hi Josh,

 

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

 

-Karoline

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=57GgZwJM8xljxzN2SaypuZDFrv4MRwYbHxV5TcsjANQ-Z&MeetingID=ode0CTAY4b6cP772MSbPFnzjjOE0s0PCmdHer8NfRJ0-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=gVMXRRoE1mYWCxx9xjQet1OKPesp2_i57K3JvwCIZqw-Z&MeetingID=XtL_FUYcUSo6gUlGvvkng_5m2OqeauLlGxgCxaYZM9k-Z


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Hi Josh,

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):

Hi Karoline,

1) Please check/confirm that the correct CyberArk connection profile is assigned to the AD_Scan job.
2) Please ensure DEBUG is turned on for the AD_SCAN job and rerun the job.
3) Please attach the DEBUG log to the case.

Right-click on the ""1-AD_Scan"" job and select ""Properties"".
In the ""Job Properties"" popup, on the ""General"" tab, select DEBUG in the ""Log Level"" drop-down.



Thank you,

Hi Mike,

 

Thank you for following up.  I put some comments below. Additionally our AD_SCAN job keeps getting errors. We worked yesterday with the CyberArk team to make sure the Hash file was updated but we are still getting the error messages. I included a screenshot below of the messages.

Hi Karoline,

Here is a summary of our meeting today and next steps:

+++++
2025_0418 Meeting:
+++++
1) Successfully upgraded to NEA v 11.6.0.141
2) TO DO: Could not install AIC 11.6.0.37 because we did not have the password for the Windows Account = ""StealthID"".

              I got details on how to get this password, they can reset it for us so I have a password when we go to set it up. I am still waiting confirmation on how to do this. 


3) TO DO: Could not get the NEA Reporting Module working because we did not have an SSL CERT assigned to/for the NEA Application server.  (certmgr)

              I have to request the cert still but it’s a short process, after I request it I will be able to install it. 




Thank you,
Mike Candon

Hi Josh,

 

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

 

-Karoline

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=57GgZwJM8xljxzN2SaypuZDFrv4MRwYbHxV5TcsjANQ-Z&MeetingID=ode0CTAY4b6cP772MSbPFnzjjOE0s0PCmdHer8NfRJ0-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=gVMXRRoE1mYWCxx9xjQet1OKPesp2_i57K3JvwCIZqw-Z&MeetingID=XtL_FUYcUSo6gUlGvvkng_5m2OqeauLlGxgCxaYZM9k-Z


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Is it possible that the ""Folder"" path changed for CyberArk?

Hi Karoline,

How long does the ""1-AD_Scan"" job take to run (historically)?

Thank you,

Hi Karoline,

1) Please check/confirm that the correct CyberArk connection profile is assigned to the AD_Scan job.
2) Please ensure DEBUG is turned on for the AD_SCAN job and rerun the job.
3) Please attach the DEBUG log to the case.

Right-click on the ""1-AD_Scan"" job and select ""Properties"".
In the ""Job Properties"" popup, on the ""General"" tab, select DEBUG in the ""Log Level"" drop-down.



Thank you,

Hi Mike,

 

Thank you for following up.  I put some comments below. Additionally our AD_SCAN job keeps getting errors. We worked yesterday with the CyberArk team to make sure the Hash file was updated but we are still getting the error messages. I included a screenshot below of the messages.

Hi Karoline,

Here is a summary of our meeting today and next steps:

+++++
2025_0418 Meeting:
+++++
1) Successfully upgraded to NEA v 11.6.0.141
2) TO DO: Could not install AIC 11.6.0.37 because we did not have the password for the Windows Account = ""StealthID"".

              I got details on how to get this password, they can reset it for us so I have a password when we go to set it up. I am still waiting confirmation on how to do this. 


3) TO DO: Could not get the NEA Reporting Module working because we did not have an SSL CERT assigned to/for the NEA Application server.  (certmgr)

              I have to request the cert still but it’s a short process, after I request it I will be able to install it. 




Thank you,
Mike Candon

Hi Mike, 

 

I apologize for sending this so close to the meeting. Would you be able to meet tomorrow and Friday to take the screenshots and do the upgrade? My day is completely open on Friday except for a 10:30 so I can be flexible with your schedule. 

 

Thank you advance,

Hi Josh,

 

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

 

-Karoline

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=57GgZwJM8xljxzN2SaypuZDFrv4MRwYbHxV5TcsjANQ-Z&MeetingID=ode0CTAY4b6cP772MSbPFnzjjOE0s0PCmdHer8NfRJ0-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=gVMXRRoE1mYWCxx9xjQet1OKPesp2_i57K3JvwCIZqw-Z&MeetingID=XtL_FUYcUSo6gUlGvvkng_5m2OqeauLlGxgCxaYZM9k-Z


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Hi Karoline,

a) Connection profiles are what get assigned to jobs and groups
b) Profiles contain credentials.

1) Was the CyberArk team able to identify on their end what these ""ACCESS DENIED"" errors look like?
I imagine you cannot attach the CyberArk log(s) to this case?

2) Did you try to reset, re-enter the User Credentials in NEA 11.6 for SB2020CBXD under theU625902 profile?
Is the ""Safe"" correct for CyberArk?
Is it possible that the ""Folder"" path changed for CyberArk?

3) Please open the connection profile that is assigned to ADI.

4) Then verify each credential for B2020CBXD under the U625902 profile.

Hi Karoline,

1) Please check/confirm that the correct CyberArk connection profile is assigned to the AD_Scan job.
2) Please ensure DEBUG is turned on for the AD_SCAN job and rerun the job.
3) Please attach the DEBUG log to the case.

Right-click on the ""1-AD_Scan"" job and select ""Properties"".
In the ""Job Properties"" popup, on the ""General"" tab, select DEBUG in the ""Log Level"" drop-down.

Hi Mike,

Thank you for following up.  I put some comments below. Additionally our AD_SCAN job keeps getting errors. We worked yesterday with the CyberArk team to make sure the Hash file was updated but we are still getting the error messages. I included a screenshot below of the messages.

Hi Karoline,

Here is a summary of our meeting today and next steps:

+++++
2025_0418 Meeting:
+++++
1) Successfully upgraded to NEA v 11.6.0.141
2) TO DO: Could not install AIC 11.6.0.37 because we did not have the password for the Windows Account = ""StealthID"".
              I got details on how to get this password, they can reset it for us so I have a password when we go to set it up. I am still waiting confirmation on how to do this.

3) TO DO: Could not get the NEA Reporting Module working because we did not have an SSL CERT assigned to/for the NEA Application server.  (certmgr)
              I have to request the cert still but it’s a short process, after I request it I will be able to install it.



Thank you,
Mike Candon

I apologize for sending this so close to the meeting. Would you be able to meet tomorrow and Friday to take the screenshots and do the upgrade? My day is completely open on Friday except for a 10:30 so I can be flexible with your schedule.

Hi Josh,

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):

Hi Karoline,

a) Connection profiles are what get assigned to jobs and groups
b) Profiles contain credentials.

1) Was the CyberArk team able to identify on their end what these ""ACCESS DENIED"" errors look like?
I imagine you cannot attach the CyberArk log(s) to this case?

2) Did you try to reset, re-enter the User Credentials in NEA 11.6 for SB2020CBXD under theU625902 profile? 
Is the ""Safe"" correct for CyberArk?
Is it possible that the ""Folder"" path changed for CyberArk?

3) Please open the connection profile that is assigned to ADI.

4) Then verify each credential for B2020CBXD under the U625902 profile.

Hi Karoline,

1) Please check/confirm that the correct CyberArk connection profile is assigned to the AD_Scan job.
2) Please ensure DEBUG is turned on for the AD_SCAN job and rerun the job.
3) Please attach the DEBUG log to the case.

Right-click on the ""1-AD_Scan"" job and select ""Properties"".
In the ""Job Properties"" popup, on the ""General"" tab, select DEBUG in the ""Log Level"" drop-down.



Thank you,

Hi Mike,

 

Thank you for following up.  I put some comments below. Additionally our AD_SCAN job keeps getting errors. We worked yesterday with the CyberArk team to make sure the Hash file was updated but we are still getting the error messages. I included a screenshot below of the messages.

Hi Karoline,

Here is a summary of our meeting today and next steps:

+++++
2025_0418 Meeting:
+++++
1) Successfully upgraded to NEA v 11.6.0.141
2) TO DO: Could not install AIC 11.6.0.37 because we did not have the password for the Windows Account = ""StealthID"".

              I got details on how to get this password, they can reset it for us so I have a password when we go to set it up. I am still waiting confirmation on how to do this. 


3) TO DO: Could not get the NEA Reporting Module working because we did not have an SSL CERT assigned to/for the NEA Application server.  (certmgr)

              I have to request the cert still but it’s a short process, after I request it I will be able to install it. 




Thank you,

Hi Mike, 

 

I apologize for sending this so close to the meeting. Would you be able to meet tomorrow and Friday to take the screenshots and do the upgrade? My day is completely open on Friday except for a 10:30 so I can be flexible with your schedule. 

 

Thank you advance,

Hi Josh,

 

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

 

-Karoline

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=57GgZwJM8xljxzN2SaypuZDFrv4MRwYbHxV5TcsjANQ-Z&MeetingID=ode0CTAY4b6cP772MSbPFnzjjOE0s0PCmdHer8NfRJ0-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=gVMXRRoE1mYWCxx9xjQet1OKPesp2_i57K3JvwCIZqw-Z&MeetingID=XtL_FUYcUSo6gUlGvvkng_5m2OqeauLlGxgCxaYZM9k-Z


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Hi Karoline,

Below is the link to the CyberArk Integration guide for NEA 11.6.
It was updated on 15-April-2025.
There may be important changes/adjustments.

Hi Karoline,

a) Connection profiles are what get assigned to jobs and groups
b) Profiles contain credentials.

1) Was the CyberArk team able to identify on their end what these ""ACCESS DENIED"" errors look like?
I imagine you cannot attach the CyberArk log(s) to this case?

2) Did you try to reset, re-enter the User Credentials in NEA 11.6 for SB2020CBXD under theU625902 profile? 
Is the ""Safe"" correct for CyberArk?
Is it possible that the ""Folder"" path changed for CyberArk?

3) Please open the connection profile that is assigned to ADI.

4) Then verify each credential for B2020CBXD under the U625902 profile.

Hi Karoline,

1) Please check/confirm that the correct CyberArk connection profile is assigned to the AD_Scan job.
2) Please ensure DEBUG is turned on for the AD_SCAN job and rerun the job.
3) Please attach the DEBUG log to the case.

Right-click on the ""1-AD_Scan"" job and select ""Properties"".
In the ""Job Properties"" popup, on the ""General"" tab, select DEBUG in the ""Log Level"" drop-down.



Thank you,

Hi Mike,

 

Thank you for following up.  I put some comments below. Additionally our AD_SCAN job keeps getting errors. We worked yesterday with the CyberArk team to make sure the Hash file was updated but we are still getting the error messages. I included a screenshot below of the messages.

Hi Karoline,

Here is a summary of our meeting today and next steps:

+++++
2025_0418 Meeting:
+++++
1) Successfully upgraded to NEA v 11.6.0.141
2) TO DO: Could not install AIC 11.6.0.37 because we did not have the password for the Windows Account = ""StealthID"".

              I got details on how to get this password, they can reset it for us so I have a password when we go to set it up. I am still waiting confirmation on how to do this. 


3) TO DO: Could not get the NEA Reporting Module working because we did not have an SSL CERT assigned to/for the NEA Application server.  (certmgr)

              I have to request the cert still but it’s a short process, after I request it I will be able to install it. 




Thank you,

Thank you advance,

Hi Josh,

 

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

 

-Karoline

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=57GgZwJM8xljxzN2SaypuZDFrv4MRwYbHxV5TcsjANQ-Z&MeetingID=ode0CTAY4b6cP772MSbPFnzjjOE0s0PCmdHer8NfRJ0-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=gVMXRRoE1mYWCxx9xjQet1OKPesp2_i57K3JvwCIZqw-Z&MeetingID=XtL_FUYcUSo6gUlGvvkng_5m2OqeauLlGxgCxaYZM9k-Z


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Hi Karoline,

Also please note that I should create a new case for this CyberArk issue.
Eventually we should close this case for the upgrade although we still have AIC and the NEA Reporting Module to upgrade.

Hi Karoline,

Below is the link to the CyberArk Integration guide for NEA 11.6.
It was updated on 15-April-2025.
There may be important changes/adjustments.

Hi Karoline,

a) Connection profiles are what get assigned to jobs and groups
b) Profiles contain credentials.

1) Was the CyberArk team able to identify on their end what these ""ACCESS DENIED"" errors look like?
I imagine you cannot attach the CyberArk log(s) to this case?

2) Did you try to reset, re-enter the User Credentials in NEA 11.6 for SB2020CBXD under theU625902 profile? 
Is the ""Safe"" correct for CyberArk?
Is it possible that the ""Folder"" path changed for CyberArk?

3) Please open the connection profile that is assigned to ADI.

4) Then verify each credential for B2020CBXD under the U625902 profile.

Hi Karoline,

1) Please check/confirm that the correct CyberArk connection profile is assigned to the AD_Scan job.
2) Please ensure DEBUG is turned on for the AD_SCAN job and rerun the job.
3) Please attach the DEBUG log to the case.

Right-click on the ""1-AD_Scan"" job and select ""Properties"".
In the ""Job Properties"" popup, on the ""General"" tab, select DEBUG in the ""Log Level"" drop-down.



Thank you,

Hi Mike,

 

Thank you for following up.  I put some comments below. Additionally our AD_SCAN job keeps getting errors. We worked yesterday with the CyberArk team to make sure the Hash file was updated but we are still getting the error messages. I included a screenshot below of the messages.

Hi Karoline,

Here is a summary of our meeting today and next steps:

+++++
2025_0418 Meeting:
+++++
1) Successfully upgraded to NEA v 11.6.0.141
2) TO DO: Could not install AIC 11.6.0.37 because we did not have the password for the Windows Account = ""StealthID"".

              I got details on how to get this password, they can reset it for us so I have a password when we go to set it up. I am still waiting confirmation on how to do this. 


3) TO DO: Could not get the NEA Reporting Module working because we did not have an SSL CERT assigned to/for the NEA Application server.  (certmgr)

              I have to request the cert still but it’s a short process, after I request it I will be able to install it. 




Thank you,

Hi Mike, 

 

I apologize for sending this so close to the meeting. Would you be able to meet tomorrow and Friday to take the screenshots and do the upgrade? My day is completely open on Friday except for a 10:30 so I can be flexible with your schedule. 

 

Thank you advance,

Hi Josh,

 

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

 

-Karoline

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=57GgZwJM8xljxzN2SaypuZDFrv4MRwYbHxV5TcsjANQ-Z&MeetingID=ode0CTAY4b6cP772MSbPFnzjjOE0s0PCmdHer8NfRJ0-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=gVMXRRoE1mYWCxx9xjQet1OKPesp2_i57K3JvwCIZqw-Z&MeetingID=XtL_FUYcUSo6gUlGvvkng_5m2OqeauLlGxgCxaYZM9k-Z


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Thank you so much and absolutely agreed. If you need to close out the upgrade ticket, I can always submit a new one once we get the new certificate. I know you have SLA’s you are trying to achieve and ied like to be respectful of that.

Hi Karoline,

Also please note that I should create a new case for this CyberArk issue.
Eventually we should close this case for the upgrade although we still have AIC and the NEA Reporting Module to upgrade.

Thank you,

Hi Karoline,

a) Connection profiles are what get assigned to jobs and groups
b) Profiles contain credentials.

1) Was the CyberArk team able to identify on their end what these ""ACCESS DENIED"" errors look like?
I imagine you cannot attach the CyberArk log(s) to this case?

2) Did you try to reset, re-enter the User Credentials in NEA 11.6 for SB2020CBXD under theU625902 profile?
Is the ""Safe"" correct for CyberArk?
Is it possible that the ""Folder"" path changed for CyberArk?

3) Please open the connection profile that is assigned to ADI.

4) Then verify each credential for B2020CBXD under the U625902 profile.

Hi Karoline,

1) Please check/confirm that the correct CyberArk connection profile is assigned to the AD_Scan job.
2) Please ensure DEBUG is turned on for the AD_SCAN job and rerun the job.
3) Please attach the DEBUG log to the case.

Right-click on the ""1-AD_Scan"" job and select ""Properties"".
In the ""Job Properties"" popup, on the ""General"" tab, select DEBUG in the ""Log Level"" drop-down.

Hi Mike,

Thank you for following up.  I put some comments below. Additionally our AD_SCAN job keeps getting errors. We worked yesterday with the CyberArk team to make sure the Hash file was updated but we are still getting the error messages. I included a screenshot below of the messages.

Hi Karoline,

Here is a summary of our meeting today and next steps:

+++++
2025_0418 Meeting:
+++++
1) Successfully upgraded to NEA v 11.6.0.141
2) TO DO: Could not install AIC 11.6.0.37 because we did not have the password for the Windows Account = ""StealthID"".
              I got details on how to get this password, they can reset it for us so I have a password when we go to set it up. I am still waiting confirmation on how to do this.

3) TO DO: Could not get the NEA Reporting Module working because we did not have an SSL CERT assigned to/for the NEA Application server.  (certmgr)
              I have to request the cert still but it’s a short process, after I request it I will be able to install it.



Thank you,
Mike Candon

Hi Mike,

I apologize for sending this so close to the meeting. Would you be able to meet tomorrow and Friday to take the screenshots and do the upgrade? My day is completely open on Friday except for a 10:30 so I can be flexible with your schedule.

Hi Josh,

Happy to be working with you again! Your availability actually lines up perfectly with when I was hoping to schedule the upgrade. I just scheduled it for the week of April 14th. The first meeting is on Monday and the Second meeting is on Thursday. Are those close enough to properly complete the upgrade?

Hello Karoline,

My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help upgrade Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. As it sounds like you already know, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

You can use the following links to schedule with me; however, I am out on PTO all next week. I do have availability tomorrow and Friday, but if my availability doesn't align well with your timetable, please let me know, and I will assign this ticket to another engineer.  Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=57GgZwJM8xljxzN2SaypuZDFrv4MRwYbHxV5TcsjANQ-Z&MeetingID=ode0CTAY4b6cP772MSbPFnzjjOE0s0PCmdHer8NfRJ0-Z<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=57GgZwJM8xljxzN2SaypuZDFrv4MRwYbHxV5TcsjANQ-Z&MeetingID=ode0CTAY4b6cP772MSbPFnzjjOE0s0PCmdHer8NfRJ0-Z__;!!Mb3P9oM!FFJlkbjtOfPmCtiXnWlLVxx-31fTXBbHVqeq3pa9bXxDBczD3ekrIVVk-2p4mhuBR5e1nIwIMV5lh_DGSUSupjcrQA$>

Hi Mike,

I was able to successfully put the request in for a new certificate, I am just waiting for the approval and then ill install the certificate on the server. I also got confirmation as to how we can access the windows account. The DBA team can reset the PW for us to be able to use it for the day, we will probably have to confirm the console itself is connected as well when we do this. I am getting confirmation on how we can request it this and will follow-up with you to schedule a meeting as soon as they confirm.

All the best,

The great news continues, I got the certificate and have installed it on the server and have a short term work around for the account connected to the AIC. Could we set up another call to finish installing it and connecting the certificate?

Also another question, one of my jobs is giving me the following error message  ""Sequence contains more than one matching element, Do you have any tips on how to best troubleshoot this?

Hi Mike,

I was able to successfully put the request in for a new certificate, I am just waiting for the approval and then ill install the certificate on the server. I also got confirmation as to how we can access the windows account. The DBA team can reset the PW for us to be able to use it for the day, we will probably have to confirm the console itself is connected as well when we do this. I am getting confirmation on how we can request it this and will follow-up with you to schedule a meeting as soon as they confirm.

All the best,
-Karoline
