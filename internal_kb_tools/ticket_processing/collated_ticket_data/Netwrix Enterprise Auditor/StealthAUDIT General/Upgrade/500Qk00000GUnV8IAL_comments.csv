"00aQk000009pA6bIAE","500Qk00000GUnV8IAL","The upgrade to 11.6 NEA was successful, however we found a problem with missing files that prevents us from editing the config on the ADI scans. We upgraded NEA in our labs internally and found the same issue so an escalation is being opened.

When attempting to upgrade AIC, we found that the DB was inaccessible, the customer is going to work to get the credentials for the DB as they did not have them immediately available, once they have this they will reschedule a meeting and we can complete the AIC upgrade.","005Qk000002AJWTIA4","2024-10-23T15:59:42.000Z","2024-10-23T15:59:42.000Z","false","false"

@Salesforce @Helen Randall @Ethan Israel Per our automation setup, a fix has been provided and there's no further action required from dev at this time. Therefore, I am closing this on our end. Ticket will re-open if problem persists.
