Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Upgraded StealthAUDIT to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor version 11.6.0.139
Upgraded Sensidive Data Discovery to version 11.6.0.18
Upgraded the Proxy server to version 11.6.0.37
Upgraded Access information center to 11.6.0.37

We tested to make sure the active directory scans were completing, we also tested to ensure that the file system schema creation tool ran successfully.

After the upgrade, we reconfigured the AIC and NEA reporting consoles to use HTTPs and validated that you could access them appropriately.

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved. The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Symptom
Proactive upgrade of NEA to version 11.6.0.139


Resolution
Upgrade completed and tested successfully.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Wajid,

I did confirm with our engineering team, we should keep the upgrade to 11.6 that we have planned as you must upgrade to 11.6 before you can upgrade to 12.0.

Thank you,

Hello Wajid,

We are not currently doing upgrades to version 12, but we can push your upgrade out a few weeks if you'd like to do that.
11.6 should not be end of life anytime soon, but 11.5 will be, can you tell me where you saw that version 11 will be end of life so I can double check that information?

Thank you,
