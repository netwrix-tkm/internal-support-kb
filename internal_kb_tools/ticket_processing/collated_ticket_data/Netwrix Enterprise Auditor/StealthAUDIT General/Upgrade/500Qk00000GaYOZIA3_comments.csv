installing NRAD upgrade

currently backing up MOTADCPRRTPV011

failed to install 2.6

error:
Module E:Program FilesNetwrixRecovery for Active DirectorySmtpNotification.comhost.dll failed to register.
HRESULT -2147450749. Contact your support personnel.

confirmed accounts and permissions
still failing

2.5 was already removed by the installer so no NRAD on system now

re-installing 2.5 throws an error as well:

error:
Service 'Netwrix Recovery Server'
(NetwrixRecoveryServer) could not be installed. Verify that you have sufficient privileges to install system services.

confirmed the account we were running the installer as had permission to logon as a service and batch job

resolved the issue:
we were entering the windows account to connect to SQL server without the domain in front
once we added that, it installed

We tried that on the 2.6 installer and it still failed with the same .dll registration error as before

will continue to troubleshoot NRAD install on a dedicated ticket after other installs

next step is to upgrade NTM","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-10-10T18:47:27.000Z","2024-10-10T18:47:27.000Z","false","false"
