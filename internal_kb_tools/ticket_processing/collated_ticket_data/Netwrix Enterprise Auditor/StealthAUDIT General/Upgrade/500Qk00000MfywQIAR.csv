Proactive Upgrade

Resolution

Upgraded the StealthAudit 11.5 console and all associated applications to NEA 11.6.0.137 using the process described in the document below:
 
Enterprise Auditor Core Upgrade Instructions
Also updated the ssl certificate bindings for both the AIC and Published Reports. During this process I discovered that the currently used certificate was not installed on the application server and may have possibly been expired. Due to this a new certificate will need to be generated and applied to the applications using the steps below:
Run CMD - netsh http del sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8082 to delete current cert
 
To add new cert run CMD - netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8082 appid= certhash=
 
Changing the port numbers to target both the AIC (481) and the Published Reports (8082) to apply these changes as well as including the updated cert hash when adding the new binding.","Proactive Upgrade","Scottie Taylor","Request","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Upgrade","11.6","","13.0","Closed - Resolved","Howard County, MD","Frank Salah","2025-03-07T15:41:52.000Z","2025-03-20T15:50:11.000Z"
