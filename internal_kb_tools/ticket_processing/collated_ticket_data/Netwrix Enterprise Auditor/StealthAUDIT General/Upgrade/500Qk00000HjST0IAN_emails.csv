Thank you for the information.  Is there documentation on how to perform the DB migration or should I just contact support for this procedure?

Hello Angie,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00425724. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00425724
Ticket Subject: Upgrade follow on questions
Ticket Details: I'm considering doing in-place application upgrades after our discussion for ticket 00423582.

2 questions I have come up with -
If I want to get my servers on 2022, should I do the OS upgrade before upgrading the applications? Would it matter either way (the servers are currently running Server 2019).

The database sizing requirements documentation seems to point to using a Full Recovery Method for SQL with log drives, etc. Currently, we've been told by support that using a Simple Recovery Method is best practice (all of our SQL files are on the same drive today). Has this recommendation changed? Now is my chance to get it setup properly.

FYI - I will be OOO for the next week so I will be unable to respond to any follow-up questions.

Thank you!

I do have a document I can share that outlines the migration of StealthAUDIT 11.5 to a new server; however, I recommend opening a support ticket and have us help with the migration. It's important to note that we don't assist with migrating the SQL database itself, although the process is the same as any other SQL database migration. Backing up, moving, and restoring a large database takes too long to perform over a remote session.

Do you know when you plan on migrating?

Thank you,

Never mind, apparently we are not deploying Server 2022 yet so there is no OS upgrade needed.  I can schedule the upgrade any time after this week.  I'd like to get some Windows service accounts created that are not being used today in the environment.

Do I need to open a fresh ticket for the upgrades for Enterprise Auditor and Threat Protection?

I can help with your upgrades, but we should open new tickets for those. I can open them for you, so don't worry about that. Since this ticket was about migration questions, I'll proceed with closing it. You're going to receive a few emails: the close of this ticket, the opening of the new Netwrix Enterprise Auditor upgrade ticket, and my initial email from that new ticket, which will include a scheduling link.

I think we should tackle the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor upgrade first. Netwrix Enterprise Auditor is an elaborate product, with many configurations and components. Our upgrades are a two-meeting process, the first is a pre-flight meeting where we review the current configuration and gather reference screenshots and backup config file. That will also serve as a good opportunity to plan the Netwrix Threat Prevention upgrade. 

Like I said, I'm going to close this ticket, but should see the other emails shortly.

Thank you,
