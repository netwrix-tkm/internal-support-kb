2 questions I have come up with - 
If I want to get my servers on 2022, should I do the OS upgrade before upgrading the applications?  Would it matter either way (the servers are currently running Server 2019).

The database sizing requirements documentation seems to point to using a Full Recovery Method for SQL with log drives, etc.  Currently, we've been told by support that using a Simple Recovery Method is best practice (all of our SQL files are on the same drive today).  Has this recommendation changed?  Now is my chance to get it setup properly.

FYI - I will be OOO for the next week so I will be unable to respond to any follow-up questions.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-10-31T18:24:41.000Z"
