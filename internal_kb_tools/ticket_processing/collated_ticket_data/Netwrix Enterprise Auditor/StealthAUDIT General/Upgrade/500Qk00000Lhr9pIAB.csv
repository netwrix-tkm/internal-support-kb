Meeting is planned for 21st of February.","We started by upgrading the Enterprise Auditor. Upgrade was performed successfully and we verified that File System solution configuration is intact. 
Next, the AIC - Access Information Center was upgraded too. 
We skipped an upgrade for the Sensitive Data Discovery addon as it is no longer used. 

We then upgraded the Activity Monitor Console as well as all the Activity Monitoring Agents.","Guidance","Artem Naskal","Request","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Upgrade","11.6","11.6.0.72","10.8","Closed - Resolved","Dubai Petroleum","Syed Tabish","2025-02-10T17:59:09.000Z","2025-02-21T13:04:51.000Z"
