"500Qk00000BrS9VIAV","00412020","Support Ticket","Upgrade Prod & Fail environments","","","","","Upgraded from the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Prod & Fail Environments:

FROM:
StealthAUDIT (SA)                            11.5.0.214
SA Access Information (AIC)            11.5.0.125

New install paths:

On both Prod and Fail we ran the following to update the URL Certs
Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:LocalMachineMy |Select-Object -Property * |Sort-Object NotAfter |Sort-Object NotAfter -Descending |
Format-Table Thumbprint,Subject,FriendlyName, NotAfter -AutoSize

##netsh update SSL Cert
netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8082
$guid = ""bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8"" # This will be the same for all installations because it is a GUID from the built-in webserver application
$certHash = ""INSERT THUMBNAIL VALUE FROM STEP 2 BETWEEN QUOTES""
$ip = ""0.0.0.0"" # this means all IP addresses
$port = ""8082"" # the default HTTPS port
""http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}"" | netsh

## AIC 11.6+
netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:481
$guid = ""bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8"" # This will be the same for all installations because it is a GUID from the built-in webserver application
$certHash = ""INSERT THUMBNAIL VALUE FROM STEP 2 BETWEEN QUOTES""
$ip = ""0.0.0.0"" # this means all IP addresses

We did have to run the following to correctly load the NEA URL.
#11.6 URL issues post upgrade ""fix"" ## If there are issues
netsh http show urlacl
netsh http delete urlacl url=""http://+:8082/""
netsh http add urlacl url=https://+:8082/ user=""NT AUTHORITYLOCAL SERVICE"" listen=yes delegate=no 


***NOTE*** Post a Fail over the following would need to be ran if the Prod SQL instance/DB is being used PRIOR to loading the console, same once back on Prod.

--  SA HOST MIRGRATED SQL UPDATE SCRIPT 
Declare @OHost varchar (128)
Declare @NHost varchar (128)
Set @OHost = '<OldSever>' -- Name of the original SA Console being cloned
Set @NHost = '<NewServer>' -- Name of the new SA Console
Update [HostMaster_SANodeFilter]
SET SA_Node = @NHost
Where SA_Node = @OHost;
Update [HostListsTbl]
SET SA_Node = @NHost
Where SA_Node = @OHost;
Update [QueryTbl]
SET SA_Node = @NHost
Where SA_Node = @OHost;
