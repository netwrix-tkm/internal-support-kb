My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From your description it looks like you are planning to migrate Access Analyzer to a new Windows server, and also want to upgrade to version 12.0.
Can you clarify if you are just look for instructions on how to perform this migration, or are you looking for any additional information or help doing this at this time?


Thank you,

H Ian,

I think it now might make sense to schedule a remote support session to do the upgrade and forego the server migration for now as I found some issues discovered during our last health check with our current installation that appear to be issues that I will need help with support on:

Those issues are as follows:

  *   Upgrade to v12
  *   Upgrade Access Information Center to latest version
  *   Fix Access Information Center Scans (showing none since 2023)
  *   Connect Enterprise Auditor to our SharePoint Online Instance
  *   Upgrade Activity Monitor

I am not sure if I should open a separate ticket on each issue listed or if we can combine into this ticket?

Thanks!

We would need separate tickets for all of these, but I can open them for you.
I should let you know that currently we are not doing any proactive upgrades to version 12.0 for a few weeks still, I can schedule you for an upgrade to 11.6 which you will need first anyway though.
I can also get the other tickets opened for you and we can trouble shoot them.

Hi Ian,

Looks like it failed again with a message of:

System.Exception: Scan data is incomplete, not importing partial results at Stealthbits StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.FSAABulkImportTask.InternalProcessRecord.

That message was listed once for each server, including the two new ones we added yesterday. The job from yesterday finished at 5am this morning.

Thanks!

Hello Casey,

It looks like we might have some stale data we need to clear out.
Can you tell me if the bulk import job failed again after our run yesterday?

Thank you,
