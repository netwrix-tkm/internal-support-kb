Thank you for the reply.

The upgrade might take ~2 hours, maybe less if we can simultaneously run the upgrade on all 4 servers.

Please use this link to schedule this activity. The meeting will take 2 hours in general:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=_KBtwy3NuOsKpukwsG8WoPhnNu9zsqbcCgOGweKaVNM-Z&MeetingID=vwe1KWPVpTVufnP_GlW1MdmU3kqdaZ.9Jh6YQ6xxACE-Z

Let me know if that's not an option for you and we can schedule 2 meetings for 1 hour each.

Hi Aleksandr,

 

We have created the change order CHG01423144 for the upgrade in our UAT servers Upgrade from V.11.5to v11.6.

 

And this is scheduled it on 07-09-2024 10:00:00 to 07-10-2024 06:00:00 but we will get the approval.

 

And copied the below NEA and AIC in this server: B0185-APP0699-S

 

But when we are trying to copy the same in the below servers getting error as “Unspecified Error” 

 

B0185-APP0700-S

B0185-APP0701-S 

B0185-APP0702-S

 

 



 





 

 

Please setup a call to copy the same in the other servers before the change.

 

 

Thanks,

Sravani

Hi AllState,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support.

Please make sure the latest NEA 11.6 is downloaded to the B servers and we can run the upgrade.
There are no prerequisites except that the scheduled scans should be completed/stopped during the upgrade.

It would be also useful to make server snapshots before the meeting to rollback if the upgrade fails.

How many B servers are affected?

Hi Aleksandr,

And this is scheduled it on 07-09-2024 10:00:00 to 07-10-2024 06:00:00 but we will get the approval.

 

And copied the below NEA and AIC in this server: B0185-APP0699-S

 

But when we are trying to copy the same in the below servers getting error as “Unspecified Error” 

 

B0185-APP0700-S

B0185-APP0701-S 

B0185-APP0702-S

 

 



 





 

 

Please setup a call to copy the same in the other servers before the change.

 

 

Thanks,

Hi AllState,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support.

Please make sure the latest NEA 11.6 is downloaded to the B servers and we can run the upgrade.
There are no prerequisites except that the scheduled scans should be completed/stopped during the upgrade.

It would be also useful to make server snapshots before the meeting to rollback if the upgrade fails.

How many B servers are affected?

Hi Sravani, Thank you for the reply. The upgrade might take ~2 hours, maybe less if we can simultaneously run the upgrade on all 4 servers. Please use this link to schedule this activity. The meeting will take 2 hours in general: https: //nwxcorp. my. salesforce-sites. com/cts?Id=_KBtwy3NuOsKpukwsG8WoPhnNu9zsqbcCgOGweKaVNM-Z&MeetingID=vwe1KWPVpTVufnP_GlW1MdmU3kqdaZ. 9Jh6YQ6xxACE-Z

Hi Aleksandr,

 

We have created the change order CHG01423144 for the upgrade in our UAT servers Upgrade from V.11.5to v11.6.

 

And this is scheduled it on 07-09-2024 10:00:00 to 07-10-2024 06:00:00 but we will get the approval.

 

And copied the below NEA and AIC in this server: B0185-APP0699-S

 

But when we are trying to copy the same in the below servers getting error as “Unspecified Error” 

 

B0185-APP0700-S

B0185-APP0701-S 

B0185-APP0702-S

 

 



 





 

 

Please setup a call to copy the same in the other servers before the change.

 

 

Thanks,

Sravani

Hi AllState, Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support. Please make sure the latest NEA 11. 6 is downloaded to the B servers and we can run the upgrade. There are no prerequisites except that the scheduled scans should be completed/stopped

Hi AllState,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support.

Please make sure the latest NEA 11.6 is downloaded to the B servers and we can run the upgrade.
There are no prerequisites except that the scheduled scans should be completed/stopped during the upgrade.

It would be also useful to make server snapshots before the meeting to rollback if the upgrade fails.

How many B servers are affected?

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
