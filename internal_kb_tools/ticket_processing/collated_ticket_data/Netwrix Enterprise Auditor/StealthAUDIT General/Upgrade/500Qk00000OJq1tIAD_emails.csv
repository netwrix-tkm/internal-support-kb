Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help. It sounds like you are already familiar with Netwrix Access Analyzer's upgrade process which requires two meetings. The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and to gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

Please use the following links to schedule the two meetings. Please make sure the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we completed the pre-flight process for upgrading your production environment to Netwrix Access Analyzer 12.0 (formally Netwrix Enterprise Auditor). We encountered no issues and made no changes while collecting the pre-flight information. 

The upgrade is already scheduled for April 30th. I see no issues with completed the upgrade on that date. If anything changes or you have any questions in the meantime, please let me know.
