This is the new ticket for upgrading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA). Like I said in my previous email from the other ticket, upgrading NEA requires two meetings. The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to gather reference screenshots and some configuration backups. This is also our opportunity to review your deployment and make a plan for the actual upgrade. Depending on your deployment, NEA has many components that may need upgrading. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

Please use the following links to schedule the 2 meetings. Please make the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=xWnfxgBbLbJUwUMOneJoCEC_vch1sNRVvqifqo1orE8-Z&MeetingID=hK7A.0y1vCuvULT_hJBmm1jzf4UjnErMrkKW3i8d2Eo-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=FQb5NJZ2h_x71gCdryH9F0B42UucnNrmI76oz.JmNEY-Z&MeetingID=0yy.42IgIGzEWWaBW48hCA9WQv5WofXXJBy9twPvmBA-Z

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we completed the pre-flight reconnaissance for the upgrade of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. The next step is to perform the actual upgrade of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, the AIC, and Netwrix Activity Monitor. That meeting is scheduled on 12/05/24 11AM EST.

We also secured the Published Reporting site with the cert you already had in place. We held off securing the AIC at this time because the new version doesn't use IIS anymore, so it would have to be redone anyway.

I asked internally, and apparently it is possible to configure automatic resources owner creation, using the Action Module. This is not something that we configure in Support and has to go through Professional Services. I can reach out to your Account Manager if you'd like to learn more about it.

Thank you,
