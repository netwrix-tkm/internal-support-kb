Hi Todd,

I was waiting for you in the meeting room for the Preflight meeting, but for some reason, you did not make it. You can use the same link to reschedule the meeting.

Correction... looks like we're on the latest FSAA proxy and SDD add-on versions so they won't need to be upgraded. Here's what I've downloaded:

- Enterprise auditor smp 11.6.0.138 (we are on 11.6.0.134)
- Enterprise auditor aic 11.6.0.37 (we are on 11.6.0.36)

Thank you for your time today.
I did the preflight in today's meeting and reviewed the current setting.
I also upgraded the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and the Access Information Center to the latest version.
The upgrade went well, and I advised you to log in to the report and AIC sites to ensure you have access.
I am closing this ticket as resolved, but please let me know if you have any issues with the upgrade.
 
Thanks,

Hey Frantz,

 

When I click that link it just says the meeting is completed.  I don’t see an option to reschedule…
