This caused us to have to uninstall the 11.6 proxies and re-install the 11.5 version as well as correct the Proxy host environmental variables to point to the correct historical location on the host where the T2 dbs and log files were located.","Guidance","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Upgrade","11.6","83","63.2","Closed - Resolved","American Express","Alex Parsa","2024-07-31T13:48:10.000Z","2024-10-02T18:35:56.000Z"
