Removed IIS from the Roles and Features via Windows Server Manager.

Noted that the Cert for the NEA and AIC URLs is set to expire on 11/1/2024

Once we have the new DigCert should be able to run the following:
Clear-Host
#Check Current cert details 
netsh http show sslcert
Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:LocalMachineMy |Select-Object -Property * |Sort-Object NotAfter |Sort-Object NotAfter -Descending |
Format-Table Thumbprint,Subject,FriendlyName, NotAfter -AutoSize
##  ^^^^  Copy the new Thumbprint

##  Past below then run the netsh update SSL Cert

netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:443
$guid = ""bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8"" # This will be the same for all installations because it is a GUID from the built-in webserver application
$certHash = ""INSERT THUMBPRINT VALUE FROM STEP 2 BETWEEN QUOTES""
$ip = ""0.0.0.0"" # this means all IP addresses
$port = ""443"" # the default HTTPS port
""http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}"" | netsh

## AIC 11.6+
netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:481
$guid = ""bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8"" # This will be the same for all installations because it is a GUID from the built-in webserver application
$certHash = ""INSERT THUMBPRINT VALUE FROM STEP 2 BETWEEN QUOTES""
$ip = ""0.0.0.0"" # this means all IP addresses
$port = ""481"" # the default HTTPS port
""http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}"" | netsh
