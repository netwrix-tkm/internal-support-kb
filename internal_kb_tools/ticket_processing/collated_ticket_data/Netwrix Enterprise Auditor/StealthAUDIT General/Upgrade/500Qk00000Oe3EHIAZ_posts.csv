ERROR: Sequence contains more than one matching element.

We also get a similar error when clicking on the jobs.

I've tried the following to no avail:
1. Reregistering the tasks.
2. Deleting all tasks and creating new ones-- we can create the task, but then get an error the same error as before, but with the new job listed in it.
3. Check for duplicates in C:WindowsTasks but only had the SA.dat file there.

Customer uploaded artifacts, just waiting on them to come through, but there isn't much in the logs. No errors were logged in any of the following WEL: Application, StealthAUDIT, System, Microsoft/TaskScheduler.

NAA 12.0 was installed with an admin account, and all installers were unblocked. I also confirmed local admins have full control permissions on the C:WindowsSystem32Tasks folder. The user logged in and the scheduled tasks user are both NAA Console Admins as well.","","","","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2025-04-30T20:29:44.000Z"
