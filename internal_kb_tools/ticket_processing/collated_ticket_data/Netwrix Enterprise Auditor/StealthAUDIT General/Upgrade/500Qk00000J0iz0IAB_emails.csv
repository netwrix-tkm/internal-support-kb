Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Josh, and I'm happy to help.

The upgrade process for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor varies depending on the solutions you have configured and additional components you have deployed.
It looks like you are licensed for File System and Sensitive Data Discovery, so I will include links to all of the relevant upgrade documents.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console: Enterprise Auditor Core Upgrade Instructions
Access Information Center: Upgrade Procedure
File System Proxy Service: Upgrade Proxy Service Procedure
Sensitive Data Discovery: Upgrade Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on

We recommend allowing us to help with the upgrade. Because deployments vary per environment, the upgrade will require two meetings:

The first is a 45-minute pre-flight meeting to plan out what components need to be upgraded and to gather reference screenshots and backup configuration files. We will not be making any changes during the pre-flight meeting. The second is a 90-minute upgrade meeting where we perform the actual upgrade.

Please use the following links to schedule the 2 meetings. Please make the upgrade meeting is scheduled after the pre-flight meeting.

Pre-flight (45-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=W4Fz8Kgt7JRzpRD0UzuMCB0nV_O5odx6kTj7Y8r17Po-Z&MeetingID=sRcdlz1AIY0nBJbLdvLmQaSFtwPO6bZqx05f6R0urV0-Z

Upgrade (90-minutes):
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=4VhRp0ly2h.pLoaLaxvwta7uddL.465nzeRH6dnW_Jk-Z&MeetingID=qD7W.7i_PHB7u148QHZNp5L6PBZlGxCV0mvWXh2zGco-Z

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you,
