Hi Frank,

Thank you for the updated information. If there isn't a PGSQL on the application server you ran the PowerShell command on then StealthDEFEND is on another server. 

If you would like to schedule a meeting you may use the link below:

Hello Frank,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. Can you please provide a text output of the results to the PowerShell command below on each application server?

#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions: 
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product | 
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | 
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize  
 
#PostgreSQL installed version  
(Get-ItemProperty  -Path ""HKLM:\SOFTWAREPostgreSQLInstallationspostgresql-x64*"" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue ).Version  

Multiple tickets will need to be created for each additional product as the each product has a different upgrade process. I will designate this ticket as a Netwrix Enterprise Auditor upgrade ticket. The initial meeting for this issue will be a pre-flight process and the following will be conducted:


	Taking screenshots of your global settings and custom jobs.
	Performing full backups of the Jobs folder.
	Performing backups of the GlobalOptions.xml and SPProfiles.xml

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thank you,

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved. The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Symptom

I want to schedule a time to get assistance with upgrading StealthAudit, StealthDefend, and StealthIntercept.

I would also like to review the certificate used for StealthDefend and possibly create a new certificate with our internal certificate authority

Cause

Proactive Upgrade

Resolution

Upgraded the StealthAudit 11.5 console and all associated applications to NEA 11.6.0.137 using the process described in the document below:
 

	Enterprise Auditor Core Upgrade Instructions

Also updated the ssl certificate bindings for both the AIC and Published Reports. During this process I discovered that the currently used certificate was not installed on the application server and may have possibly been expired. Due to this a new certificate will need to be generated and applied to the applications using the steps below:


	Run CMD - netsh http del sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8082 to delete current cert
	 
	To add new cert run CMD - netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8082 appid= certhash=
	 

Changing the port numbers to target both the AIC (481) and the Published Reports (8082) to apply these changes as well as including the updated cert hash when adding the new binding.


Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,
