"00aQk0000098Jl3IAE","500Qk00000FjJCMIA3","old SAM version is still being used on different server to audit different servers than the NEA host server SAM installation
-it was setup that way because they couldn't update .NET on those servers
-client is no longer interested in auditing those servers
-can remove old SAM 3.0 during upgrade call

no Azure jobs in schedule

gathering screenshots

lots of File servers which are all listed individually
-taking a long time to click through all the screens
-mostly set the same, just changes to the scoping

handful of proxies

no sensitive data

gathered all the files onto the app server desktop

uploaded document with screen shots to ticket
will upload zoom meeting recording when available","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-09-16T19:01:53.000Z","2024-09-16T19:09:33.000Z","false","false"

upgrade SAM to latest NAM 7.1

confirming .zip not blocked
extracting
running.msi from Admin CMD prompt

confirming previous install path:
D:Program FilesStealthBitsFile Monitor
-using same path for new version

install complted without issue

launching NAM
all servers' agents returning ""outdated""
-expected

kicking off agent upgrade in UI for the 1 server
-client only wants to keep the agent on the one server
-no longer auditing the other servers

agent upgrade completed
checking outputs
-2 NetAPP servers being audited
-each had an errro that they couldn't create the policy because one already existed with that name
--I think this is expected
-server connected after
-both seem to be getting data and working

Removed and uninstalled agent from other servers
3 servers failed the uninstall due to inability to communicate with server
just removed the servers from the list

after a couple minutes one of the NetAPP outputs errored saying it couldn't communicate with the server
-however, latest events was still updating

client's remote session died
we couldn't connect back
client is certain it's a network issue on their end and not related to our upgrade

client will let me know how it looks going forward","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-09-27T16:34:53.000Z","2024-09-27T16:34:53.000Z","false","false"
