I see that the other product ""Netwrix Auditor 10.7"" supports Windows 2025 for instance. 
But that is not the same product as our StealthAudit (Netwrix Enterprise Auditor) platform. 
 
I could not locate official documentation so just trying to find out before we upgrade our servers to the newest server OS release from Microsoft. 

We are currently on: 
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6.0.75 and on Win2016 bservers.

We are looking into performing a tech refresh, with new servers and newer updated versions of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor & other modules too. 

So we would need to upgrade the OS from win2016 to win2025 (or win2022 perhaps, but trying to get long term gains of going to win2025 if it is officially supported) and also our Netwrix Enterprise Auditor & other modules too. 
Netwrix Activity Monitor
Netwrix Activity Monitor Agent
Netwrix Access Information Center
Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6

Thanks!!!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-14T14:39:53.000Z"
