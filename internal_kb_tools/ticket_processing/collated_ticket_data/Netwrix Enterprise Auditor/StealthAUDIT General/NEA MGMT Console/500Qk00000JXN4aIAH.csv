As seen on log snippet above, it seems that the ""Root element is missing"" is caused by incorrect/corrupted xml in this folder on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server:
F:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITReports 

Solution:
1. Close Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console if it is running.

2. Find this folder on the Enterprise Auditor server:
F:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITReports

3. Rename the folder, for example by adding '_old' at the end of its name so that the folder name is ""Reports_old"".

4. Start Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console. This will re-create the ""Reports"" folder.
