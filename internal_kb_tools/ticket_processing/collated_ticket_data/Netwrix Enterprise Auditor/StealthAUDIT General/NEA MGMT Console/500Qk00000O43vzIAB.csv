Customer reported that SDDs Extractor log files are occupying around 90 GB each. 
As a result their End Customer`s space on the NAA server gets filled up pretty quickly. 

I asked them to clarify with end customer the size of the scanned environment to see if it is expected for us to produce such big log files. 

Also - Log files can be safely deleted to free up some space. 

In the mean time, I asked in SWAT for a way to control retention for SDD log files:

Was on a meeting with customer today. 
We confirmed that the biggest Extractor log file was created by File System SDD job. 
Job is scanning a single file server. 

Results of SDD for this server display these numbers:
Folder Count: 371709
File Count: 1 934 177
Item Count: 2 305 942

SDD criteria are the following:

We lowered logging level from Debug to Warning. I asked customer to restart File System solution and let me know if they see Extractor files reach the same size (around 90 gb).

In the mean time, need to clarify if it is expected to see Extractor files of such size with this File Server + SDD criteria settings.","Customer will reply back with results of FileSystem SDD scan after lowering log level to Warning.","Install directory for the Netwrix Access Analyzer was filling up with '_Extractor_' log files.
After performing a check on the Access Analyzer settings it was found that these logs were a debug level logging of the Sensitive Data Discovery job that was scanning a large File Server.

We disabled Debug logging by changing logging level to ""Warning"".
This decreased the size of the log files.

It was also suggested using ""History"" job tab to keep in check the number of log files kept by the job:

""History"" tab in the properties of the Jobs that use Sensitive Data Discovery.
There are log retention parameters that control how many log files to keep. By lowering the number of logs you can also keep the volume consumption to a minimum.
To get to these settings Right-Click needed job > select ""Properties"" > then navigate to the ""History"" tab.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Artem Naskal","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","NEA MGMT Console","11.6","11.6.0.132","21.1","Closed - Resolved","MANCOSA","ziyaad Rasool","2025-04-15T07:19:33.000Z","2025-05-06T09:00:22.000Z"
