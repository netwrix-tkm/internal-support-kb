Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. 

Looks like this was moved under the My Products page which should only require the same log in used to open tickets netwrix.com/my_products_int.html

Power BI Report Pack for Active Directory1.0 https://releases.netwrix.com/resources/stealthaudit/reportpack/stealthaudit-reportpack-powerbiad-1.0.zip 

To update our Technical Support Notes could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""BinAccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")

Please let me know if any additional assistance is needed for this case.
