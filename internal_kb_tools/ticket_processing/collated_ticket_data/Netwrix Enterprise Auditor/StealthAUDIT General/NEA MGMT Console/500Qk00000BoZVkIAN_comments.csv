- Reboot is the only fix (has happened 3 times since 6/1/24)
- SA Console logs have rolled over, but nothing stands out in the SA Windows App Event Log
- Found 8 instances of the console hanging since 5/2023
- There was no additional information in the Security and Maintenance
- No correlating errors/issues on the SQL server event logs
- Customer does take schedule back ups of the SQL db that could be causing issues based on how things line up -- he is going to check with his DBA on when this runs
- May be environmental on the SA ""Health"" console server
- There is antivirus with exclusions and customer is going to double check that they are still in place though I feel like we'd see this occur more if that was the issue

**Current Issue**
Console hangs at ""Testing SQL Connection"" when launching the console occasionally. There is a corresponding Event ID 1002 in the Windows App Event Log stating: The program StealthAUDIT.EXE version 11.6.1410.246 stopped interacting with Windows and was closed. (6/23/24 @ 7:58:12 AM) Hang type: Cross-thread. Rebooting is the only way to fix the issue.

**Troubleshooting Completed during Meeting**
- Verified the console is now set to DEBUG
- Checked SQL logs for any related errors/actions
- Verified the job that was running during the time of the hang (FS Advanced > EMC > FSAC) completed successfully
- NEA system has 32GB RAM/8c CPU and is only used for NEA so shouldn't be a resource issue 

**Logs/Screenshots Collected**
None

**Next Steps**
- Grab debug logs the next time the console hangs","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2024-06-28T14:53:51.000Z","2024-06-28T14:53:51.000Z","false","false"

**Problem Statement/Business Impact**
Console hangs at ""Testing SQL Connection"" when launching the console occasionally. There is a corresponding Event ID 1002 in the Windows App Event Log stating: The program StealthAUDIT.EXE version 11.6.1410.246 stopped interacting with Windows and was closed.

**Desired Outcome**
Customer would like to be able to open the console consistently without having to reboot.

**Steps to Reproduce**
In the customer's environment, it seems that the 2 jobs running when this happens is: FileSystem5. ActivitySecurityFS_HighRiskActivity & FileSystemAdvanced0.Collections1. EMC Collections1. Activity5-FSAC_Exceptions

**Troubleshooting Completed/Notes**
- Verified antivirus exclusions
- NEA system has 32GB RAM/8c CPU and is only used for NEA so shouldn't be a resource issue
- No errors found in the SQL logs
- Verified Usage Statistics are off in both the console and the GlobalOptions.xml
- Renamed the UsageStatistics folder in %SAInstallDir%SPSQLScripts to UsageStatisics_UNUSED
- Deleted the Stored Procedures under Programmability on the NEA database (All that started with ""dbo.SA_UsageStatistics_"")
--- In our meeting after this, it looks like the Stored Procedures were able to recreate themselves in SQL somehow
- 2 jobs running when trying to open console: FileSystem5. ActivitySecurityFS_HighRiskActivity & FileSystemAdvanced0.Collections1. EMC Collections1. Activity5-FSAC_Exceptions
-- Tried kicking off both jobs at the same time to force the hang but no luck on the call
