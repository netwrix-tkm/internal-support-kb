We are currently planning to upgrade our version of StealthAUDIT, but seems like the console doesn't have access rights for my admin account which previously i had, previously when i encounter this issue i managed to manually add the access rights using another admin account which the account was installed with, now even using that i'm unable to do so, can we have a session to address this issue before our upgrade tomorrow","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-19T07:38:18.000Z"

We investigated the issue when trying to open the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console (NEA). The error observed was access denied. To resolve this issue, we performed the following steps:

We deleted the ""RbaConfigured"" key from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareWow6432NodeStealthbits

We deleted the ""rba.conf"" file from the NEA installation directory.

After that we an error that license is expired. We imported the license and completed the wizard","","","","005Qk00000214EvIAI","2024-11-29T03:08:26.000Z"
