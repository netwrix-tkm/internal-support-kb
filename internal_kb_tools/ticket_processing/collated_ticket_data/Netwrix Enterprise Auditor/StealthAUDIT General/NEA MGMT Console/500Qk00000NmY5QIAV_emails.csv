Hello
I have gone through the add host list wizard a few times trying to add the new file server. I add the new server manually then when I get to the second step I have chosen all three of the options for the credentials and get the same error on all of them. I have verified that the service account is active, not locked and the password is still correct.

The new file server is showing in the activity monitor and it is showing changes in there as well.

2025_0407: Customer is running NEA v11.6.0.88 or so?? (far behind 11.6.0.139)
+++++
0) Only 1 of these 3 jobs normally takes days to run:

1) .Active Directory Inv running for 6 days and 10 hours

2) Active Directory running for 6 days 13 hours

3) Active Directory Advanced - 3d 5 hours

4) They were running at the same time and locking each other out

Error found in the SADebug.TSV log = ""Failed to add host <HOSTNAME> to master: The transaction log for database 'StealthAudit' is full due to 'ACTIVE_TRANSACTION'.

This is because one "".AD Inventory"" and 2 AD jobs were running (not successfully) at the same time.

5) Killed the 2 AD jobs and 1 .AD Inv job and now he was able to add the host name successfully.
