In NEA (or NAA) are you referring to ""Host Management"" where there are a number of created host lists?

See the Netwrix Help Center documentation here:

Yes. My question is given a host, how can I determine all of the host groups it is a member of? I don't see the answer in the documentation links you provided. I'll be out of the office until Monday.

Here is the SQL that could be configured in a Job to achieve what you are looking for.

I would run it against your database to see what it returns for a list. 

select hmt.name as Host_Name
, hlt.name as list_name
from HostListsContentTbl hlct
join HostListsTbl hlt on hlt.listID = hlct.listID
join SA_HostMasterTbl hmt on hmt.hostID = hlct.hostID
