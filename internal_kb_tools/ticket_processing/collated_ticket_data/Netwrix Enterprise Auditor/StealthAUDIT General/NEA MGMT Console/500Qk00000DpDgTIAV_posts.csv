Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""
    
    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

After that console launched, but the issue reoccurs after some time","","","","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2024-10-30T07:03:38.000Z"
