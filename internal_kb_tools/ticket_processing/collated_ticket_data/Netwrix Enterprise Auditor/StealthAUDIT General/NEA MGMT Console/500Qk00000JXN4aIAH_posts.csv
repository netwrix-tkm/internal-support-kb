As seen on log snippet above, it seems that the ""Root element is missing"" is caused by incorrect/corrupted xml in this folder on the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor server:
F:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITReports 

Solution:
1. Close Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console if it is running.

2. Find this folder on the Enterprise Auditor server:
F:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITReports

3. Rename the folder, for example by adding '_old' at the end of its name so that the folder name is ""Reports_old"".

4. Start Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console. This will re-create the ""Reports"" folder. 
Try navigating the console by opening settings for different jobs in File System and SharePoint solutions and let me know if the ""Root element is missing"" error appears again or not.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-01-03T07:38:42.000Z"
