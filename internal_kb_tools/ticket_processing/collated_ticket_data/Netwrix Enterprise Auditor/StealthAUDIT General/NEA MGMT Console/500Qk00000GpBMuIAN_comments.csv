One host initially threw this error ""Error executing query on instance 'FW-ITSQL-2.OHPNY.COMMSSQLSERVER' and database 'master' : 'USE master"" and the rest of the script is listed too.

Now after a few runs all hosts are doing that.  Customer has uploaded Debug logs.","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-12-05T15:33:22.000Z","2024-12-05T15:33:22.000Z","false","false"

@Ethan Israel @James Anderson @Michael Burrofato @Helen Randall @Salesforce Regarding the error reported yesterday - it seems that this is custom SQL written for the 4-SQL_ServerLogons_default_trace job that is failing. We don't maintain this script.

@Laura Suter @Ethan Israel @Michael Burrofato @Helen Randall @Salesforce 

Looks like we are hitting the execution timeout now. 



This job creates 5 X 50MB files by default. If they fill it rolls over back to the first file, so it never uses more than 250MB. If pulling the data back is taking too long then reducing the size of the files should help. This will require more frequent collection to avoid losing entries.


The file size can be edited on this line near the top 

--- CODE ---
ADD TARGET package0.event_file(SET filename=N'netwrix-enterprise-auditor--successful-logins', max_file_size=(50))
--- CODE ---

Just alter the 50 to the size needed. Then delete the extended events session if it already exists and then run the job to create the extended event session again with the new file size

Permissions is behaving as a whole. We have some weirdness with a few hosts but overall the perms job is running.
I have also spun off a ticket for the activity.","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-12-12T22:06:01.000Z","2024-12-12T22:06:01.000Z","false","false"
