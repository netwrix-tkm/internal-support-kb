The .jar file that's flagged up is: 
c:program files (x86)stealthbitsstealthauditactionssurveytomcatbin<a href='https://tomcat-juli.jar' target='_blank'>tomcat-juli.jar</a>

We are already running version 11.6, is this .jar file still use by Enterprise Auditor or can it be removed?

Many thanks.","","I got more information from customer. 
They said that vulnerabilities that got flagged up for ""tomcat-juli.jar"" file are the following:
CVE-2019-0232L  - Apache Tomcat: Important: Remote Code Execution on Windows (CVE-2019-0232)
CVE-2020-1938 - Apache Tomcat: High: AJP Request Injection and potential Remote Code Execution (CVE-2020-1938)
 
Both of these vulnerabilities are mentioned in here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000I0wCAE.html
 
This one - CVE-2019-0232L  - Apache Tomcat: Important: Remote Code Execution on Windows (CVE-2019-0232), is not a threat to customer as per description from the article above says:
""We don't ship with any CGI components configured in web.xml, additionally we don't use CGI in any capacity""
 
However, the second one has this description:
""AJP can be manually disabled via the in conf/server.xml. See details in the related YT ticket, SMPC-9278."" 
 
I`ve check the config file of the tomcat webserver that is shipped with NEA - and the ""Connector protocol=""AJP/1.3"" is commented out(means disabled). 
The Tomcat config file is located here:
C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITActionsSurveyTomcatconfserver.xml 
This connector protocol is commented out and is not used:
    <Connector protocol=""AJP/1.3""
               address=""::1""
               port=""8009""
               redirectPort=""8443"" />

This means that both vulnerabilities are addressed in the latest NEA versions and customer can keep using the tomcat-juli.jar file.","Support provided customer with information about vulnerabilities and how they are addressed in NEA.
