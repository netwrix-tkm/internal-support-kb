We haven't identified the issue yet but we have what we need to investigate. We don't have anything else to check with the customer at this point, we just need to pull this on to investigate the provided artifacts once bandwidth allows.

@Salesforce @Helen Randall - I moved this up in stackrank to be pulled on sooner than the 12.0 code freeze. We should be able to pull this on to investigate next sprint and provide actionable information 10/30. The timeline for delivery of any needed fix would depend on the outcome of the investigation.

It looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off.

@Salesforce Hi Damir! Could you please ask the customer to provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html), making use of procdump -ma PID

where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 they'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes. For example, if they expect to have 5 jobs running, they should take dumps of more than 5 processes. They should also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console. It will be most useful if they perform this next time they see the issue.
When they perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as they'll be of use alongside the dump files.

@Salesforce On the below as well, it would be handy to know how many processes were running vs how many jobs should be running when sending back this information! Thanks.

@Salesforce Hi Damir, could you ask the customer to try the following. Wherever they have NEA installed, if they go to the following path STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITSPSQLScriptsUsageStatistics they should see some .proc files starting with SA_UsageStatistics like so:


If they move all of these files from this location (and store somewhere else on safe keeping) and then let us know if that resolves the issue. If this doesn't resolve the issue, we'll probably need some more log and procdump files when it happens again so we can look into it further. 

Thanks,
Carla

@Salesforce @Ethan Israel @Carla Whiteford @Sanjay Meghani Yes, we will get an item on our backlog to review why the usage stats queries were causing a hang. Probably also need to review why they were being ran, as we wouldn't expect those to be ran if usage stats was turned off.

But glad to hear that the workaround is working.
