Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. 
My name is Artem, and I will be assisting you with this ticket. 

I have checked a new installation of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor in my lab, and I can confirm that the ""c:program files (x86)stealthbitsstealthauditactionssurveytomcatbintomcat-juli.jar"" file is there, which means that it is still been shipped with the 11.6 version of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor.  

Please, allow me some time to clarify the use case for this file, whether it can be removed or not and what impact that will have on the Enterprise Auditor as a whole.
I will get back to you as soon as I have an update. 
Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA
