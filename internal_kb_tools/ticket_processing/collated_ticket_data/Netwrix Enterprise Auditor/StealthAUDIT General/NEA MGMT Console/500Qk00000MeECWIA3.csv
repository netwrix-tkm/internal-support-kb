Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.240

As directed by R&D we found that the Web UI was not able to load either in relation to the “hexadecimal value 0x00, is an invalid character. Line 1” error.

The correction was to rebuild the Reports Folder under the install path  D:STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITReports  the original folder was renamed ap[pending _03132025 to the end.
Closed and reopened the SA Console to rebuild the folder.

We then re-published the reports under the .Active Directory Inventory Job Group 
•	Publish – Publishes the reports from the selected job group or job without regenerating the report. See the Reporting topic for additional information.
