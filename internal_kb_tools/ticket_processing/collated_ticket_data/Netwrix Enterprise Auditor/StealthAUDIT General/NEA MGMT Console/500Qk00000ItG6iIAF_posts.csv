They said that vulnerabilities that got flagged up for ""tomcat-juli.jar"" file are the following:
CVE-2019-0232L  - Apache Tomcat: Important: Remote Code Execution on Windows (CVE-2019-0232)
CVE-2020-1938 - Apache Tomcat: High: AJP Request Injection and potential Remote Code Execution (CVE-2020-1938)
 
Both of these vulnerabilities are mentioned in here:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000I0wCAE.html
 
This one - CVE-2019-0232L  - Apache Tomcat: Important: Remote Code Execution on Windows (CVE-2019-0232), is not a threat to customer as per description from the article above says:
""We don't ship with any CGI components configured in web.xml, additionally we don't use CGI in any capacity""
 
However, the second one has this description:
""AJP can be manually disabled via the in conf/server.xml. See details in the related YT ticket, SMPC-9278."" 
 
I`ve check the config file of the tomcat webserver that is shipped with NEA - and the ""Connector protocol=""AJP/1.3"" is commented out(means disabled). 
The Tomcat config file is located here:
C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITActionsSurveyTomcatconfserver.xml 
This connector protocol is commented out and is not used:
    <Connector protocol=""AJP/1.3""
               address=""::1""
               port=""8009""
               redirectPort=""8443"" />

This means that both vulnerabilities are addressed in the latest NEA versions and customer can keep using the tomcat-juli.jar file.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2024-12-10T13:47:45.000Z"
