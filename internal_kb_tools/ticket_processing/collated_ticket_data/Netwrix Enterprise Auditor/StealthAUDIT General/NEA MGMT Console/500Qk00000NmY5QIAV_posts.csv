1) .Active Directory Inv running for 6 days and 10 hours
 
2) Active Directory running for 6 days 13 hours 
 
3) Active Directory Advanced - 3d 5 hours

4) They were running at the same time and locking each other out

Error found in the SADebug.TSV log = transaction log for database 'StealthAudit' is full due to 'ACTIVE_TRANSACTION'.

This is because 3 AD jobs were running (not successfully) at the same time.
