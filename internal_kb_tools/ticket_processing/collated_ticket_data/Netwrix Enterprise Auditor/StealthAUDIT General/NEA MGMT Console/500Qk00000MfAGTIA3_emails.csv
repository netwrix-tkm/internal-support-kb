Please refer to some of the security methods our application can implement:

Securing the reports:

Role Based Access:

While I understand the urgency - all of our security steps can be found in the documentation in our Help Center, and there is no 'hardening guide' available.

Hello Shashitharan,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! I've tried to call you but it didn't connect. I'm re-assigning this ticket to our APAC Team for better coverage.

Could you please specify what you mean by 'application hardening'? Some of our products allow for agent hardening, but I'm unsure if we're able to do that on the console level.

Best wishes,

Hello Shashitharan,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Tech Support! I've tried to call you but it didn't connect. I'm re-assigning this ticket to our APAC Team for better coverage.

Could you please specify what you mean by 'application hardening'? Some of our products allow for agent hardening, but I'm unsure if we're able to do that on the console level.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

I hope you are doing well. I haven't had a response on this ticket after attempting to contact you previously. As your original query has been answered and additional tickets have launched for other products, this incident will now be closed. If you require further information, the incident ticket can be reopened within 30 days, after this time a new ticket can be created and linked to this incident ticket for history.

Have a great day!

Hi Shashi,

Thank you for your response. I have created two separate tickets 00438498 and 00438499 for Netwrix Threat Prevention and Netwrix Threat Manager respectively. I have shared my response on those tickets. For this ticket, if all is set am I good to close this case?

Have a great day!

Please refer to some of the security methods our application can implement:

Securing the reports:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm

Role Based Access:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Settings/Access/RoleBased/RoleDefinitions.htm

While I understand the urgency - all of our security steps can be found in the documentation in our Help Center, and there is no 'hardening guide' available.
