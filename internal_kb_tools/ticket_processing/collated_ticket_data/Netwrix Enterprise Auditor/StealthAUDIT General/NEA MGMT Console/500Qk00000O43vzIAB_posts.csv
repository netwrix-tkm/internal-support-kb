Customer reported that SDDs Extractor log files are occupying around 90 GB each. 
As a result their End Customer`s space on the NAA server gets filled up pretty quickly. 

I asked them to clarify with end customer the size of the scanned environment to see if it is expected for us to produce such big log files. 

Also - Log files can be safely deleted to free up some space. 

In the mean time, I asked in SWAT for a way to control retention for SDD log files:

Was on a meeting with customer today. 
We confirmed that the biggest Extractor log file was created by File System SDD job. 
Job is scanning a single file server. 

Results of SDD for this server display these numbers:
Folder Count: 371709
File Count: 1 934 177
Item Count: 2 305 942

SDD criteria are the following:
https://nwxcorp.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/ContentDocument/069Qk00000NZWEHIA5/view

We lowered logging level from Debug to Warning. I asked customer to restart File System solution and let me know if they see Extractor files reach the same size (around 90 gb).

In the mean time, need to clarify if it is expected to see Extractor files of such size with this File Server + SDD criteria settings.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-04-25T11:02:17.000Z"
