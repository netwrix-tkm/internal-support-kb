Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
My name is Artem, I will be assisting you with this ticket.

To help us expedite issue resolution and streamline our support for you, please, provide additional information from your side by answering these questions:


	What is a company name of the endpoint customer? 
	Currently the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation folder is been filled up with files containing ""_Extractor_"" in their names. That is the main issue, correct?
	Could you please take screenshots of these files and share these screenshots with me?
	What jobs/solutions are currently configured and are running in this Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation? 
	When did this issue with ""_Extractor_"" files started to happen? Did it happen after configuring a new Data Collection/Job? 
	Were there any changes implemented to the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) recently?



To continue, it would help me a lot if you could share the exact build number of Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) that is currently installed on the server in question.
Run this PowerShell command from an admin Powershell to get the exact build number of Netwrix software that is currently installed:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Please, share the output of this command with me via email. The version/build number must be visible.

I am looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

I have an update for you.

The _Extractor_ files are the log files for the Sensitive Data Discovery module. As seen on the screenshot you shared these files are several weeks old. You can safely delete them to free up space on the drive.

To understand the reason why Sensitive Data Discovery job created logs of such size an inspection of the SDD Jobs is required.
Could you clarify with end customer which solutions have Sensitive Data Discovery jobs enabled? Are they using Sensitive Data Discovery for SharePoint solution for example?

Hello Ziyaad, 

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
My name is Artem, I will be assisting you with this ticket.

To help us expedite issue resolution and streamline our support for you, please, provide additional information from your side by answering these questions:


	What is a company name of the endpoint customer? 
	Currently the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation folder is been filled up with files containing ""_Extractor_"" in their names. That is the main issue, correct?
	Could you please take screenshots of these files and share these screenshots with me?
	What jobs/solutions are currently configured and are running in this Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation? 
	When did this issue with ""_Extractor_"" files started to happen? Did it happen after configuring a new Data Collection/Job? 
	Were there any changes implemented to the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) recently?



To continue, it would help me a lot if you could share the exact build number of Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) that is currently installed on the server in question.
Run this PowerShell command from an admin Powershell to get the exact build number of Netwrix software that is currently installed:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Please, share the output of this command with me via email. The version/build number must be visible.

I am looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Ziyaad,

I have an update for you.

The _Extractor_ files are the log files for the Sensitive Data Discovery module. As seen on the screenshot you shared these files are several weeks old. You can safely delete them to free up space on the drive.

To understand the reason why Sensitive Data Discovery job created logs of such size an inspection of the SDD Jobs is required.
Could you clarify with end customer which solutions have Sensitive Data Discovery jobs enabled? Are they using Sensitive Data Discovery for SharePoint solution for example?

Hi Ziyaad,

Thank you very much for sharing all of these details!

According to information you provided the files are generated by Sensitive Data Discovery module.
To continue troubleshooting I need to analyze application logs.

Please, collect the following log files and place them into ZIP archive:
This entire folder:
StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

And an SDDScanHost log file/files from this folder:
SensitiveDatalogs

Please, upload resulting archive to the ticket 00442050 using customer portal and notify me once the upload has completed:  https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
I am looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Thank you for getting back to me with this update and for providing this information.
In such case, most likely it is the SharePoint SDD (Sensitive data scan) that is producing such big scan logs.

I would suggest finding out the number of Sites/Sites Collections and estimated number of items on their SharePoint side that SDD is scanning - this will help us understand if it is expected to see such log size.
Please, let me know if you have this information at your disposal. Thank you!

Hello Ziyaad, 

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
My name is Artem, I will be assisting you with this ticket.

To help us expedite issue resolution and streamline our support for you, please, provide additional information from your side by answering these questions:


	What is a company name of the endpoint customer? 
	Currently the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation folder is been filled up with files containing ""_Extractor_"" in their names. That is the main issue, correct?
	Could you please take screenshots of these files and share these screenshots with me?
	What jobs/solutions are currently configured and are running in this Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation? 
	When did this issue with ""_Extractor_"" files started to happen? Did it happen after configuring a new Data Collection/Job? 
	Were there any changes implemented to the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) recently?



To continue, it would help me a lot if you could share the exact build number of Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) that is currently installed on the server in question.
Run this PowerShell command from an admin Powershell to get the exact build number of Netwrix software that is currently installed:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Please, share the output of this command with me via email. The version/build number must be visible.

I am looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Ziyaad,

Thank you for getting back to me with this update and for providing this information.
In such case, most likely it is the SharePoint SDD (Sensitive data scan) that is producing such big scan logs.

I would suggest finding out the number of Sites/Sites Collections and estimated number of items on their SharePoint side that SDD is scanning - this will help us understand if it is expected to see such log size.
Please, let me know if you have this information at your disposal. Thank you!

Hello Ziyaad,

I have an update for you.

The _Extractor_ files are the log files for the Sensitive Data Discovery module. As seen on the screenshot you shared these files are several weeks old. You can safely delete them to free up space on the drive.

To understand the reason why Sensitive Data Discovery job created logs of such size an inspection of the SDD Jobs is required.
Could you clarify with end customer which solutions have Sensitive Data Discovery jobs enabled? Are they using Sensitive Data Discovery for SharePoint solution for example?

Hello Ziyaad, 

I have an update for you.

The _Extractor_ files are the log files for the Sensitive Data Discovery module. As seen on the screenshot you shared these files are several weeks old. You can safely delete them to free up space on the drive.

To understand the reason why Sensitive Data Discovery job created logs of such size an inspection of the SDD Jobs is required.
Could you clarify with end customer which solutions have Sensitive Data Discovery jobs enabled? Are they using Sensitive Data Discovery for SharePoint solution for example?

Hello Ziyaad, 

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
My name is Artem, I will be assisting you with this ticket.

To help us expedite issue resolution and streamline our support for you, please, provide additional information from your side by answering these questions:


	What is a company name of the endpoint customer? 
	Currently the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation folder is been filled up with files containing ""_Extractor_"" in their names. That is the main issue, correct?
	Could you please take screenshots of these files and share these screenshots with me?
	What jobs/solutions are currently configured and are running in this Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation? 
	When did this issue with ""_Extractor_"" files started to happen? Did it happen after configuring a new Data Collection/Job? 
	Were there any changes implemented to the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) recently?



To continue, it would help me a lot if you could share the exact build number of Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) that is currently installed on the server in question.
Run this PowerShell command from an admin Powershell to get the exact build number of Netwrix software that is currently installed:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Please, share the output of this command with me via email. The version/build number must be visible.

I am looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Ziyaad,

Thank you for clarifying this.
May I suggest we schedule a meeting for 30-40 minutes to perform a check up of the Sensitive Data Discovery jobs for the end customer?
It will help me understand configuration in detail as this information is needed to confirm if such size of log files is expected or not.

Please, use this link to schedule meeting with me:

Hi Ziyaad,

Thank you for getting back to me with this update and for providing this information.
In such case, most likely it is the SharePoint SDD (Sensitive data scan) that is producing such big scan logs.

I would suggest finding out the number of Sites/Sites Collections and estimated number of items on their SharePoint side that SDD is scanning - this will help us understand if it is expected to see such log size.
Please, let me know if you have this information at your disposal. Thank you!

Hello Ziyaad,

I have an update for you.

The _Extractor_ files are the log files for the Sensitive Data Discovery module. As seen on the screenshot you shared these files are several weeks old. You can safely delete them to free up space on the drive.

To understand the reason why Sensitive Data Discovery job created logs of such size an inspection of the SDD Jobs is required.
Could you clarify with end customer which solutions have Sensitive Data Discovery jobs enabled? Are they using Sensitive Data Discovery for SharePoint solution for example?

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Ziyaad,

Thank you very much for sharing all of these details!

According to information you provided the files are generated by Sensitive Data Discovery module.
To continue troubleshooting I need to analyze application logs.

Please, collect the following log files and place them into ZIP archive:
This entire folder:
StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

And an SDDScanHost log file/files from this folder:
SensitiveDatalogs

Please, upload resulting archive to the ticket 00442050 using customer portal and notify me once the upload has completed:  https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html
I am looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Hello Ziyaad, 

I have an update for you.

The _Extractor_ files are the log files for the Sensitive Data Discovery module. As seen on the screenshot you shared these files are several weeks old. You can safely delete them to free up space on the drive.

To understand the reason why Sensitive Data Discovery job created logs of such size an inspection of the SDD Jobs is required.
Could you clarify with end customer which solutions have Sensitive Data Discovery jobs enabled? Are they using Sensitive Data Discovery for SharePoint solution for example?

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Ziyaad, 

Thank you very much for sharing all of these details!

According to information you provided the files are generated by Sensitive Data Discovery module.
To continue troubleshooting I need to analyze application logs.

Please, collect the following log files and place them into ZIP archive:
This entire folder:
StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

And an SDDScanHost log file/files from this folder:
SensitiveDatalogs

Please, upload resulting archive to the ticket 00442050 using customer portal and notify me once the upload has completed:  https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html 
I am looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Best regards,

Hi Artem,

 

Apologies was out of office.

 

Please see requested information below in RED:

 


	What is a company name of the endpoint customer?  - Mancosa
	Currently the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation folder is been filled up with files containing ""_Extractor_"" in their names. That is the main issue, correct? – Yes, that is the issue for this ticket.
	Could you please take screenshots of these files and share these screenshots with me? – Please see attached below (Image1).
	What jobs/solutions are currently configured and are running in this Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation? – Active Directory, Entra, FileSystems, SharePoint, Permission Analyzer
	When did this issue with ""_Extractor_"" files started to happen? Did it happen after configuring a new Data Collection/Job?  - I am not too sure but only started investigating when discovering the disk space starting to fill up. From the timestamps on the below screenshot it looks like 5th March 2025.
	Were there any changes implemented to the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) recently? – No

Hello Ziyaad, 

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
My name is Artem, I will be assisting you with this ticket.

To help us expedite issue resolution and streamline our support for you, please, provide additional information from your side by answering these questions:


	What is a company name of the endpoint customer? 
	Currently the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation folder is been filled up with files containing ""_Extractor_"" in their names. That is the main issue, correct?
	Could you please take screenshots of these files and share these screenshots with me?
	What jobs/solutions are currently configured and are running in this Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation? 
	When did this issue with ""_Extractor_"" files started to happen? Did it happen after configuring a new Data Collection/Job? 
	Were there any changes implemented to the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) recently?



To continue, it would help me a lot if you could share the exact build number of Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) that is currently installed on the server in question.
Run this PowerShell command from an admin Powershell to get the exact build number of Netwrix software that is currently installed:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Please, share the output of this command with me via email. The version/build number must be visible.

I am looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Artem Naskal

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
The following is a recap of what we discussed:

After comparing the dates on the Extractor log files and the File System SDD scan we found that the biggest Extractor log file was created by File System SDD collection.

As such, we agreed to test File System SDD job after lowering the logging level in Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) to ""Warning"".
Please, let me know results once SDD job for File Server finishes and let me know if you see the Extractor log files of the similar size after it (around 90 gb).

To continue, we also checked previous results of the File System SDD scan and the number of items and files is the following:

Folder Count: 371709
File Count: 1 934 177
Item Count: 2 305 942

At the same time, Mancosa has the following SDD Criteria configured:


 

I will consult with my team to clarify if this size of Extractor log files is expected for the File System SDD scan in case of this size of File Server and these Criteria settings. I will get back to you once I have any news.

In the mean time, I am looking forward to your reply with results of the SDD job for File Server.
Thank you!

Hi Ziyaad, 

Thank you for clarifying this.
May I suggest we schedule a meeting for 30-40 minutes to perform a check up of the Sensitive Data Discovery jobs for the end customer?
It will help me understand configuration in detail as this information is needed to confirm if such size of log files is expected or not.

Please, use this link to schedule meeting with me:

Hi Ziyaad, 

Thank you for getting back to me with this update and for providing this information.
In such case, most likely it is the SharePoint SDD (Sensitive data scan) that is producing such big scan logs.

I would suggest finding out the number of Sites/Sites Collections and estimated number of items on their SharePoint side that SDD is scanning - this will help us understand if it is expected to see such log size.
Please, let me know if you have this information at your disposal. Thank you!

To help us expedite issue resolution and streamline our support for you, please, provide additional information from your side by answering these questions:


	What is a company name of the endpoint customer? 
	Currently the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation folder is been filled up with files containing ""_Extractor_"" in their names. That is the main issue, correct?
	Could you please take screenshots of these files and share these screenshots with me?
	What jobs/solutions are currently configured and are running in this Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) installation? 
	When did this issue with ""_Extractor_"" files started to happen? Did it happen after configuring a new Data Collection/Job? 
	Were there any changes implemented to the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) recently?



To continue, it would help me a lot if you could share the exact build number of Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) that is currently installed on the server in question.
Run this PowerShell command from an admin Powershell to get the exact build number of Netwrix software that is currently installed:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Please, share the output of this command with me via email. The version/build number must be visible.

I am looking forward to your reply. Thank you!

Best regards,

We are currently looking for the best solution for your main concern about the size of Extractor log files. But we still need additional time for it.

In the mean time, I wanted to ask if you have an update about results of the File System SDD job.
Have you noticed the same log file size after we decreased the logging level from ""Debug"" to ""Warning""?

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hello Ziyaad, 

Thank you for your time on a meeting today.
The following is a recap of what we discussed:

After comparing the dates on the Extractor log files and the File System SDD scan we found that the biggest Extractor log file was created by File System SDD collection.

As such, we agreed to test File System SDD job after lowering the logging level in Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) to ""Warning"".
Please, let me know results once SDD job for File Server finishes and let me know if you see the Extractor log files of the similar size after it (around 90 gb).

To continue, we also checked previous results of the File System SDD scan and the number of items and files is the following:

Folder Count: 371709
File Count: 1 934 177
Item Count: 2 305 942

At the same time, Mancosa has the following SDD Criteria configured:


 

I will consult with my team to clarify if this size of Extractor log files is expected for the File System SDD scan in case of this size of File Server and these Criteria settings. I will get back to you once I have any news.

In the mean time, I am looking forward to your reply with results of the SDD job for File Server.
Thank you!

Hi Ziyaad, 

Thank you for clarifying this.
May I suggest we schedule a meeting for 30-40 minutes to perform a check up of the Sensitive Data Discovery jobs for the end customer?
It will help me understand configuration in detail as this information is needed to confirm if such size of log files is expected or not.

Please, use this link to schedule meeting with me:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=5dqUugyhnLyESHi_PgBneShqIWtil8irgMRFT54RuI4-Z&MeetingID=QKb6V54604rKWoKCPHhx003lM_ums_MtUDGFjamKC.w-Z

Let me know if you have any additional questions or suggestions - I will be happy to help!

Hi Ziyaad, 

Thank you for getting back to me with this update and for providing this information.
In such case, most likely it is the SharePoint SDD (Sensitive data scan) that is producing such big scan logs.

I would suggest finding out the number of Sites/Sites Collections and estimated number of items on their SharePoint side that SDD is scanning - this will help us understand if it is expected to see such log size.
Please, let me know if you have this information at your disposal. Thank you!

Hello Ziyaad, 

I have an update for you.

The _Extractor_ files are the log files for the Sensitive Data Discovery module. As seen on the screenshot you shared these files are several weeks old. You can safely delete them to free up space on the drive.

To understand the reason why Sensitive Data Discovery job created logs of such size an inspection of the SDD Jobs is required.
Could you clarify with end customer which solutions have Sensitive Data Discovery jobs enabled? Are they using Sensitive Data Discovery for SharePoint solution for example?

Best regards,
Artem Naskal

Hi Ziyaad, 

Thank you very much for sharing all of these details!

According to information you provided the files are generated by Sensitive Data Discovery module.
To continue troubleshooting I need to analyze application logs.

Please, collect the following log files and place them into ZIP archive:
This entire folder:
StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs

And an SDDScanHost log file/files from this folder:
SensitiveDatalogs

Please, upload resulting archive to the ticket 00442050 using customer portal and notify me once the upload has completed:  https://www.netwrix.com/tickets.html 
I am looking forward to your reply. Thank you!
