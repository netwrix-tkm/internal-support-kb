Hasbul,

Thank you for reaching out to support.
We are aligning your ticket with an engineer to assist with your issue.

Is anyone from your team able to log into the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) console?

Do you have a custom Job that resets users accounts within NEA/SA? Password resets are not typical functionality within this application.

Along with the following please attach any image that will help with troubleshooting the issue(s).

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Hasbul,

Thank you for reaching out to support. 
We are aligning your ticket with an engineer to assist with your issue.

Is anyone from your team able to log into the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) console?

Do you have a custom Job that resets users accounts within NEA/SA? Password resets are not typical functionality within this application.

Along with the following please attach any image that will help with troubleshooting the issue(s).

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""BinAccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")

Thank You for your time.
