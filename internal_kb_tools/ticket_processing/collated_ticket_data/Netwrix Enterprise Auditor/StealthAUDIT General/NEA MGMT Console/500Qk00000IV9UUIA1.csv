We are currently planning to upgrade our version of StealthAUDIT, but seems like the console doesn't have access rights for my admin account which previously i had, previously when i encounter this issue i managed to manually add the access rights using another admin account which the account was installed with, now even using that i'm unable to do so, can we have a session to address this issue before our upgrade tomorrow","","The customer is trying to open the NEA console and gets an error message that they are not authorized to access the console. Since the customer is not responding, we haven't been able to get a session for looking into a potential issue.


We investigated the issue when trying to open the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console (NEA). The error observed was access denied. To resolve this issue, we performed the following steps:

We deleted the ""RbaConfigured"" key from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareWow6432NodeStealthbits

We deleted the ""rba.conf"" file from the NEA installation directory.

After that we an error that license is expired. We imported the license and completed the wizard","Customer will acquire the SQL DB credentials, complete the wizard and let us know by noon today. I will send a follow up email too later today.","deleted the RbaConfigured key from ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareWow6432NodeStealthbits"" followed by removing """"rbac.conf"""" file from NEA installation directory.""","Product defect","Saqib Sharif","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","NEA MGMT Console","11.6","11.6.0.117","13.0","Closed - Resolved","Overseas Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC)","Shashitharan Navandran","2024-11-19T07:38:16.000Z","2024-12-02T07:43:20.000Z"
