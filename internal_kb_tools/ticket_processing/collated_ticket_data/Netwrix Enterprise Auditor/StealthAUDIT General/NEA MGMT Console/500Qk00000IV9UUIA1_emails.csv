Best wishes,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
investigated the issue when you were trying to open the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console (NEA). The error observed was access denied. To resolve this issue, we performed the following steps:

We deleted the ""RbaConfigured"" key from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareWow6432NodeStealthbits

We deleted the ""rba.conf"" file from the NEA installation directory.

After that we an error that license is expired. We imported the license and completed the wizard. I am also attaching the reference article link:

Update License Key

However, at the end of the wizard we saw that NEA was asking for SQL DB credentials for connection.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Acquire the SQL DB credentials and complete the wizard.

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved. The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Symptom
When you were trying to open the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Console, you were getting access denied error

Resolution
To resolve the issue, we deleted the RbaConfigured key from ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESoftwareWow6432NodeStealthbits"" followed by removing """"rbac.conf"""" file from NEA installation directory. The NEA wizard asked for credentials for SQL server. You will work out with your team internally and set the correct credentials for storage profile to be used for storing data in DB."
