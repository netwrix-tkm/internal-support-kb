Hi Damir,

 

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

 

Please review the logs and share the findings.

 

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

 

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay. Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE. html), making use of procdump -ma PID Where PID is



 


Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions  https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.


Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off. Can you provide the full results of the query?

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.

 

Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet. I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed

 

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Hi Sukanya, judging on symptoms it looks like job schedule might be the issue here, do you run Active Directory Inventory on weekends?

Could you please tell me if highlighted checkbox is on for Active Directory Inventory?



When this issue reoccurs again, could you please run this query in SQL management studio and provide me the output?

SELECT

    c.session_id,
    s.login_name,
    c.connect_time,
    s.host_name,

Hi Damir,

 

Yes, the issue has reoccurred this weekend. I would like to highlight that we have noticed it happening more frequently on weekends compared to weekdays since it first occurred.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""
    
    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor


This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;


This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT 
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;


Additionally you were asking about securing web console, you can do this using this article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm

If you need assistance with securing web console, please log another ticket.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for prompt response, AIC shouldn't affect loading of NEA, AIC shouldn't create high load on SQL side, and we're suspecting that multiple jobs somehow suspend new connections.

I realize that this wasn't the issue with StealthAUDIT 11.5. We're still looking into it.

Could you please send me screenshot of schedules?



 


	As mentioned, we are encountering this issue following the upgrade of the StealthAudit application to version 11.6. However, we have observed that the StealthAudit Access Information Center is still at version 11.5. Shouldn’t this component have been upgraded along with the StealthAudit application? - Yes, we recommend this component to be updated as well. If you need assistance with upgrade, please log a new ticket for that and we will be happy to assist you.


      2. Could this version mismatch be contributing to the problem? - No, it shouldn't contributing to the problem, AIC doesn't create such load or sessions to affect SQL database connectivity.

Hi Damir,

 

Currently, I could see 3 jobs are running in NEA console. PFB snip for your reference.

 



 

 

Queries related to the case:

 


	As mentioned, we are encountering this issue following the upgrade of the StealthAudit application to version 11.6. However, we have observed that the StealthAudit Access Information Center is still at version 11.5. Shouldn’t this component have been upgraded along with the StealthAudit application?
	Could this version mismatch be contributing to the problem?


 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, could you please tell me how many jobs you have running at the time?
We need to determine if many jobs running at same time is affecting NEA launching process.

If you have other queries regarding the issue please let me know - what exactly are those queries, so I can get answers for before we have meeting, if such meeting would be required. To keep our interaction productive.

Hi Damir,

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

Please review the logs and share the findings.

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay. Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE. html), making use of procdump -ma PID Where PID is

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html__;!!E09OEw!f6YPeyKyH6Tcsey5PygMOF4seiXxfenj7d5qmzelIGLZYjbtOQFbO1XpUdGSNsXq9b6zlL4uGoFvDKhg0LvQKBWuLQ$>), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.


Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off. Can you provide the full results of the query?

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,



Thanks for the response.



As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.



Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.



Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet. I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed



Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #416701 - - [EXTERNAL] SQL transaction issue due to which Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console is not accessible [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0DpDgT:ref ]

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""

    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor


This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;


This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;


Additionally you were asking about securing web console, you can do this using this article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm__;!!E09OEw!eRHMe0dvutfdxy3JpGNydm0LIz2maK2jyjxfyibfYLPGVpUQQq1EVWFLR671FE6G-kKYwS4G-nQE7DeM__ahooaF7w$>

Thank you for update Sukanya, I am checking with my team, I can see that multiple jobs are scheduled for same time, but it's not something like 20+ jobs on same time which could cause issues. I will get back to you later today or tomorrow

Hi Sukanya, thank you for prompt response, AIC shouldn't affect loading of NEA, AIC shouldn't create high load on SQL side, and we're suspecting that multiple jobs somehow suspend new connections.

I realize that this wasn't the issue with StealthAUDIT 11.5. We're still looking into it.

Could you please send me screenshot of schedules?

[cid:image011.png@01DB3261.7B091190]



  1.  As mentioned, we are encountering this issue following the upgrade of the StealthAudit application to version 11.6. However, we have observed that the StealthAudit Access Information Center is still at version 11.5. Shouldn’t this component have been upgraded along with the StealthAudit application? - Yes, we recommend this component to be updated as well. If you need assistance with upgrade, please log a new ticket for that and we will be happy to assist you.

      2. Could this version mismatch be contributing to the problem? - No, it shouldn't contributing to the problem, AIC doesn't create such load or sessions to affect SQL database connectivity.

Hi Sukanya, could you please tell me how many jobs you have running at the time?
We need to determine if many jobs running at same time is affecting NEA launching process.

If you have other queries regarding the issue please let me know - what exactly are those queries, so I can get answers for before we have meeting, if such meeting would be required. To keep our interaction productive.

Hi Damir,

 

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

 

Please review the logs and share the findings.

 

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

 

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay. Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE. html), making use of procdump -ma PID Where PID is

 

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.

Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off. Can you provide the full results of the query?

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.

 

Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet. I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed

 

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""
    
    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;

This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT 
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;

Additionally you were asking about securing web console, you can do this using this article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm

If you need assistance with securing web console, please log another ticket.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for prompt response, AIC shouldn't affect loading of NEA, AIC shouldn't create high load on SQL side, and we're suspecting that multiple jobs somehow suspend new connections.

I realize that this wasn't the issue with StealthAUDIT 11.5. We're still looking into it.

Could you please send me screenshot of schedules?

[Inline image name : image011.png]

 

As mentioned, we are encountering this issue following the upgrade of the StealthAudit application to version 11.6. However, we have observed that the StealthAudit Access Information Center is still at version 11.5. Shouldn’t this component have been upgraded along with the StealthAudit application? - Yes, we recommend this component to be updated as well. If you need assistance with upgrade, please log a new ticket for that and we will be happy to assist you.

      2. Could this version mismatch be contributing to the problem? - No, it shouldn't contributing to the problem, AIC doesn't create such load or sessions to affect SQL database connectivity.

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, could you please tell me how many jobs you have running at the time?
We need to determine if many jobs running at same time is affecting NEA launching process.

If you have other queries regarding the issue please let me know - what exactly are those queries, so I can get answers for before we have meeting, if such meeting would be required. To keep our interaction productive.

Hi Damir,

 

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

 

Please review the logs and share the findings.

 

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

 

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay. Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE. html), making use of procdump -ma PID Where PID is

 

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.

Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off.

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.

 

Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet. I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed

 

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""
    
    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;

This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT 
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;

Additionally you were asking about securing web console, you can do this using this article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm

If you need assistance with securing web console, please log another ticket.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for prompt response, AIC shouldn't affect loading of NEA, AIC shouldn't create high load on SQL side, and we're suspecting that multiple jobs somehow suspend new connections.

I realize that this wasn't the issue with StealthAUDIT 11.5. We're still looking into it.

Could you please send me screenshot of schedules?

[Inline image name : image011.png]

 

As mentioned, we are encountering this issue following the upgrade of the StealthAudit application to version 11.6. However, we have observed that the StealthAudit Access Information Center is still at version 11.5. Shouldn’t this component have been upgraded along with the StealthAudit application? - Yes, we recommend this component to be updated as well. If you need assistance with upgrade, please log a new ticket for that and we will be happy to assist you.

      2. Could this version mismatch be contributing to the problem? - No, it shouldn't contributing to the problem, AIC doesn't create such load or sessions to affect SQL database connectivity.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, could you please tell me how many jobs you have running at the time?
We need to determine if many jobs running at same time is affecting NEA launching process.

If you have other queries regarding the issue please let me know - what exactly are those queries, so I can get answers for before we have meeting, if such meeting would be required. To keep our interaction productive.

Hi Damir,

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

Please review the logs and share the findings.

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html__;!!E09OEw!f6YPeyKyH6Tcsey5PygMOF4seiXxfenj7d5qmzelIGLZYjbtOQFbO1XpUdGSNsXq9b6zlL4uGoFvDKhg0LvQKBWuLQ$>), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.


Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off. Can you provide the full results of the query?

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,



Thanks for the response.



As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.



Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.



Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet. I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed



Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Hi Damir,



Thanks for the response.



Active Directory Inventory job is scheduled to run every day.



Yes, the option “Collect only updates since the last scan” is enabled for the job. Please find the below snip for your reference.



As suggested, will run the given query when the issue reoccurs and share the results.

Hi Sukanya, judging on symptoms it looks like job schedule might be the issue here, do you run Active Directory Inventory on weekends? Could you please tell me if highlighted checkbox is on for Active Directory Inventory? When this issue reoccurs



Hi Sukanya, judging on symptoms it looks like job schedule might be the issue here, do you run Active Directory Inventory on weekends?

Could you please tell me if highlighted checkbox is on for Active Directory Inventory?

[cid:image008.png@01DB35EC.31833D00]

When this issue reoccurs again, could you please run this query in SQL management studio and provide me the output?

Hi Damir,



Yes, the issue has reoccurred this weekend. I would like to highlight that we have noticed it happening more frequently on weekends compared to weekdays since it first occurred.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""

    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor


This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;


This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;


Additionally you were asking about securing web console, you can do this using this article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm__;!!E09OEw!eRHMe0dvutfdxy3JpGNydm0LIz2maK2jyjxfyibfYLPGVpUQQq1EVWFLR671FE6G-kKYwS4G-nQE7DeM__ahooaF7w$>

Hi Sukanya, thank you for prompt response, AIC shouldn't affect loading of NEA, AIC shouldn't create high load on SQL side, and we're suspecting that multiple jobs somehow suspend new connections.

I realize that this wasn't the issue with StealthAUDIT 11.5. We're still looking into it.

Could you please send me screenshot of schedules?

[cid:image012.png@01DB35EC.31833D00]



  1.  As mentioned, we are encountering this issue following the upgrade of the StealthAudit application to version 11.6. However, we have observed that the StealthAudit Access Information Center is still at version 11.5. Shouldn’t this component have been upgraded along with the StealthAudit application? - Yes, we recommend this component to be updated as well. If you need assistance with upgrade, please log a new ticket for that and we will be happy to assist you.

      2. Could this version mismatch be contributing to the problem? - No, it shouldn't contributing to the problem, AIC doesn't create such load or sessions to affect SQL database connectivity.

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, could you please tell me how many jobs you have running at the time?
We need to determine if many jobs running at same time is affecting NEA launching process.

If you have other queries regarding the issue please let me know - what exactly are those queries, so I can get answers for before we have meeting, if such meeting would be required. To keep our interaction productive.

Hi Damir,

 

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

 

Please review the logs and share the findings.

 

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

 

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay. Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE. html), making use of procdump -ma PID Where PID is

 

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.

Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off.

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.

 

Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet. I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed

 

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""
    
    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;

This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT 
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;

Additionally you were asking about securing web console, you can do this using this article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm

If you need assistance with securing web console, please log another ticket.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for prompt response, AIC shouldn't affect loading of NEA, AIC shouldn't create high load on SQL side, and we're suspecting that multiple jobs somehow suspend new connections.

I realize that this wasn't the issue with StealthAUDIT 11.5. We're still looking into it.

Could you please send me screenshot of schedules?

[Inline image name : image012.png]

 

As mentioned, we are encountering this issue following the upgrade of the StealthAudit application to version 11.6. However, we have observed that the StealthAudit Access Information Center is still at version 11.5. Shouldn’t this component have been upgraded along with the StealthAudit application? - Yes, we recommend this component to be updated as well. If you need assistance with upgrade, please log a new ticket for that and we will be happy to assist you.

      2. Could this version mismatch be contributing to the problem? - No, it shouldn't contributing to the problem, AIC doesn't create such load or sessions to affect SQL database connectivity.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Damir,

Thanks for the clarification.

As suggested, we have disabled “Usage Statistics” under the application settings. Will monitor the application and let you know if this improves the situation.

Meanwhile, please keep us informed if you receive any updates from the Development team.

Hi Damir,

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

Please review the logs and share the findings.

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html__;!!E09OEw!f6YPeyKyH6Tcsey5PygMOF4seiXxfenj7d5qmzelIGLZYjbtOQFbO1XpUdGSNsXq9b6zlL4uGoFvDKhg0LvQKBWuLQ$>), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.


Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off.

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,



Thanks for the response.



As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.



Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.



Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet. I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed



Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Hi Damir,



Yes, the issue has reoccurred this weekend. I would like to highlight that we have noticed it happening more frequently on weekends compared to weekdays since it first occurred.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""

    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor


This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;


This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;


Additionally you were asking about securing web console, you can do this using this article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm__;!!E09OEw!eRHMe0dvutfdxy3JpGNydm0LIz2maK2jyjxfyibfYLPGVpUQQq1EVWFLR671FE6G-kKYwS4G-nQE7DeM__ahooaF7w$>

Hi Sukanya, thank you for prompt response, AIC shouldn't affect loading of NEA, AIC shouldn't create high load on SQL side, and we're suspecting that multiple jobs somehow suspend new connections.

I realize that this wasn't the issue with StealthAUDIT 11.5. We're still looking into it.

Could you please send me screenshot of schedules?

[cid:image012.png@01DB3699.F586F400]



  1.  As mentioned, we are encountering this issue following the upgrade of the StealthAudit application to version 11.6. However, we have observed that the StealthAudit Access Information Center is still at version 11.5. Shouldn’t this component have been upgraded along with the StealthAudit application? - Yes, we recommend this component to be updated as well. If you need assistance with upgrade, please log a new ticket for that and we will be happy to assist you.

      2. Could this version mismatch be contributing to the problem? - No, it shouldn't contributing to the problem, AIC doesn't create such load or sessions to affect SQL database connectivity.

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Damir,

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

Please review the logs and share the findings.

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay. Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE. html), making use of procdump -ma PID Where PID is

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html__;!!E09OEw!f6YPeyKyH6Tcsey5PygMOF4seiXxfenj7d5qmzelIGLZYjbtOQFbO1XpUdGSNsXq9b6zlL4uGoFvDKhg0LvQKBWuLQ$>), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.


Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off. Can you provide the full results of the query?

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,



Thanks for the response.



As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.



Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.



Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""

    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor


This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;


This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;


Additionally you were asking about securing web console, you can do this using this article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm__;!!E09OEw!eRHMe0dvutfdxy3JpGNydm0LIz2maK2jyjxfyibfYLPGVpUQQq1EVWFLR671FE6G-kKYwS4G-nQE7DeM__ahooaF7w$>

If you need assistance with securing web console, please log another ticket.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for prompt response, AIC shouldn't affect loading of NEA, AIC shouldn't create high load on SQL side, and we're suspecting that multiple jobs somehow suspend new connections.

I realize that this wasn't the issue with StealthAUDIT 11.5. We're still looking into it.

Could you please send me screenshot of schedules?

[cid:image023.png@01DB38B7.9FC351B0]



  1.  As mentioned, we are encountering this issue following the upgrade of the StealthAudit application to version 11.6. However, we have observed that the StealthAudit Access Information Center is still at version 11.5. Shouldn’t this component have been upgraded along with the StealthAudit application? - Yes, we recommend this component to be updated as well. If you need assistance with upgrade, please log a new ticket for that and we will be happy to assist you.

      2. Could this version mismatch be contributing to the problem? - No, it shouldn't contributing to the problem, AIC doesn't create such load or sessions to affect SQL database connectivity.

Hi Damir,

 

Thanks for the clarification.

 

As suggested, we have disabled “Usage Statistics” under the application settings. Will monitor the application and let you know if this improves the situation.  

 

Meanwhile, please keep us informed if you receive any updates from the Development team.

Hi Damir,

 

As checked, Usage Statistics is enabled in Settings>Application. Before we proceed with disabling it, could you please let us the purpose of the setting and whether disabling it will have any impact?

As mentioned earlier, kindly ensure that you include all recipients in your response by replying to all, as I have included my teammates in the email thread.

Hi Damir,

 

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

 

Please review the logs and share the findings.

 

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

 

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay. Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE. html), making use of procdump -ma PID Where PID is

 

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.

Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.

 

Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet. I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed

 

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""
    
    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;

This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT 
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;

Additionally you were asking about securing web console, you can do this using this article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm

If you need assistance with securing web console, please log another ticket.

Thank you for update Sukanya, I am checking with my team, I can see that multiple jobs are scheduled for same time, but it's not something like 20+ jobs on same time which could cause issues. I will get back to you later today or tomorrow

Hi Damir,

This is to inform you that we are still observing SQL transaction issue while accessing Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console even after disabling “Usage Statistics” under the application settings as suggested.

Could you please let us know if you have received any updates from the Development team.

Hi Damir,

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

Please review the logs and share the findings.

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay. Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE. html), making use of procdump -ma PID Where PID is

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html__;!!E09OEw!f6YPeyKyH6Tcsey5PygMOF4seiXxfenj7d5qmzelIGLZYjbtOQFbO1XpUdGSNsXq9b6zlL4uGoFvDKhg0LvQKBWuLQ$>), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.


Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off. Can you provide the full results of the query?

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,



Thanks for the response.



As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.



Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.



Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Hi Damir,



Thanks for the response.

Hi Sukanya, judging on symptoms it looks like job schedule might be the issue here, do you run Active Directory Inventory on weekends? Could you please tell me if highlighted checkbox is on for Active Directory Inventory? When this issue reoccurs



Hi Sukanya, judging on symptoms it looks like job schedule might be the issue here, do you run Active Directory Inventory on weekends?

Could you please tell me if highlighted checkbox is on for Active Directory Inventory?

When this issue reoccurs again, could you please run this query in SQL management studio and provide me the output?

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""

    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor


This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;


This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t

Hi Damir,

 

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

 

Please review the logs and share the findings.

 

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

 

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay. Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE. html), making use of procdump -ma PID Where PID is

 

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.

Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off.

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.

 

Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet. I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed

 

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #416701 - - [EXTERNAL] SQL transaction issue due to which Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console is not accessible [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0DpDgT:ref ]

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""
    
    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor

This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;

This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT 
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;

Additionally you were asking about securing web console, you can do this using this article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm

If you need assistance with securing web console, please log another ticket.

Hi Damir,

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

Please review the logs and share the findings.

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay. Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE. html), making use of procdump -ma PID Where PID is

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html__;!!E09OEw!f6YPeyKyH6Tcsey5PygMOF4seiXxfenj7d5qmzelIGLZYjbtOQFbO1XpUdGSNsXq9b6zlL4uGoFvDKhg0LvQKBWuLQ$>), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.


Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off. Can you provide the full results of the query?

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,



Thanks for the response.



As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.



Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.



Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""

    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor


This query might help you DBA to determine which sessions are using Temp DB

SELECT
    s.session_id,
    r.status,
    r.command,
    r.cpu_time,
    r.total_elapsed_time,
    r.reads,
    r.writes,
    t.text AS query_text,
    (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) * 8 AS tempdb_space_kb
FROM sys.dm_db_task_space_usage tsu
JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests r ON tsu.session_id = r.session_id
JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions s ON r.session_id = s.session_id
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE (tsu.internal_objects_alloc_page_count + tsu.user_objects_alloc_page_count) > 0
ORDER BY tempdb_space_kb DESC;


This query will help to point out blocked sessions:

SELECT
    blocking_session_id AS blocker,
    session_id AS blocked_session,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    t.text AS blocked_query_text
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) t
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;


Additionally you were asking about securing web console, you can do this using this article:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Install/Application/Reports/Secure.htm__;!!E09OEw!eRHMe0dvutfdxy3JpGNydm0LIz2maK2jyjxfyibfYLPGVpUQQq1EVWFLR671FE6G-kKYwS4G-nQE7DeM__ahooaF7w$>

Hi Damir,

 

As checked, Usage Statistics is enabled in Settings>Application. Before we proceed with disabling it, could you please let us the purpose of the setting and whether disabling it will have any impact?

As mentioned earlier, kindly ensure that you include all recipients in your response by replying to all, as I have included my teammates in the email thread.

Hi Sukanya, could you please check if Usage Statistics is enabled in Settings>Application? If it is enabled, can you disable it and see if that improves situation? I am asking since we want to minimize number of active sessions to SQL server

Hi Damir,

 

As requested, we have collected process dump, Application logs and SAJobEngine logs from StealthAudit server when the issue reoccurred and uploaded in the case.

 

Please review the logs and share the findings.

 

However, we were unable to take a screenshot of ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree from the console as the issue reoccurred and we had to terminate jobs to temporarily fix the issue. Please find the screenshot from task manager for the StealthAudit jobs running during the issue observed.

 

How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring? – 24 StealthAudit processes and based on task scheduler 12 jobs were running.

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay. Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE. html), making use of procdump -ma PID Where PID is

 

Hi Sukanya, my apologies for delay.

Could you please provide a process dump (as per these instructions https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000J03CAE.html), making use of procdump -ma PID

Where PID is the process ID in question (e.g. for PID 12345 you'll do procdump -ma 12345 at an administrator command prompt), and to do it for a sampling of the running StealthAUDIT.exe processes.

For example, if you expect to have 5 jobs running, you should take dumps of more than 5 processes.

Please also take some screenshots of the ""Running Instances"" node in the job tree of the console.

It will be most useful if you perform this next time you see the issue.

When you perform this action, it would be handy to get fresh log files from the StealthAUDITSADatabaseLogs folder (from both the Application and SAJobEngine subfolders), as you'll be of use alongside the dump files.

Last thing please clarify the following:

1. How many processes were running and how many jobs when you see this issue occurring?

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, it looks like we're missing some information in the query response you provided, on the second line it cuts off after ""EX_MetricsCollec"", we can't tell, for example, whether it's just those two jobs or if there's more info missing below where it's cut off.

Hi Sukanya, I realize it was working fine on 11.5, we're working on permament solution in parallel to what I suggested, we're still investigating issue internally, next status update from development team is expected by the end of October, that why I am checking if there's any temporary workaround for this issue.

I will keep you posted on any findings.

Hi Damir,

 

Thanks for the response.

 

As informed earlier, we haven’t made any changes to the schedule and the application was functioning properly with version 11.5. However, we have encountered the issue only after the upgrade.

 

Please note, other jobs may have dependency on the Active Directory Inventory job, we would prefer not to change the schedule. Additionally, even if we schedule the job to run for 2-3 days, the issue might occur on the scheduled days. Hence, we request you to suggest an alternative solution to address this problem permanently.

 

Regards,

Sukanya Jaivelu

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet. I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed

 

Hi Sukanya, I am doing ok thank you, hope you're doing well too, the issue is still being investigated, I didn't get an update from R&D team yet.

I would like you to clarify if Active Directory Inventory job schedule can be changed as temporary workaround until we find a solution?
Does it have to run daily? Or can you afford to run it once in 2-3 days?

I am asking since on troubleshooting session, stopping that job helped us to launch Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console normally.

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call today, on meeting we've stopped all running jobs and ended every single StealthAudit process using task manager, then we ran this script:

# Specify the path to the folder you want to scan
$folderPath = ""%sainstalldir%""

# Recursively find all files with the .lck extension
$lckFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $folderPath -Recurse -Filter *.lck

# Check if any files were found
if ($lckFiles.Count -eq 0) {
    Write-Host ""No files with the .lck extension found.""
} else {
    Write-Host ""The following files with the .lck extension were found:""
    $lckFiles | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_.FullName }

    # Ask the user if they want to delete the files
    $response = Read-Host ""Do you want to delete these files? (y/n)""
    
    if ($response -eq 'y') {
        # Delete the found files
        $lckFiles | Remove-Item -Force
        Write-Host ""Files successfully deleted.""
    } else {
        Write-Host ""Deletion cancelled by the user.""
    }
}

To remove any orphanated .lck files.

After running the script we've checked with DBA team on any aborted/hung jobs in tempdb, DBA team confirmed that no jobs were found.

We've launched Netwrix Enterprise Auditor console without any issues.

Next action:

1. Run jobs manually and on schedule to confirm that issue is resolved.

I will keep this ticket on hold until Friday so you have time to test, on Friday I will follow up with you and if issue no longer occurs will proceed with ticket closure.

Damir Akhmatshin

Hi Sukanya, thank you for your time on call, we've reviewed the issue. Using Powershell script I've provided we've detected multiple running.lck files (5+ files), after stopping ADI job we could launch the application.

Running.lck file contains information on PID of scan and stops the job from running again whilst it exists, and orphanated running.lck files could be an issue for loading Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application.

Next actions:

1. Stop all running jobs
2. Run script I've provided to you to remove running.lck files. (I will attach this script in case you would need it, it is attached as txt file)
3. After ensuring all jobs has been stopped and running.lck files were removed, please request your DBA to check Temp DB for aborted/hung jobs and clear them if they exist in Temp DB.
4. Run Netwrix Enterprise Auditor
