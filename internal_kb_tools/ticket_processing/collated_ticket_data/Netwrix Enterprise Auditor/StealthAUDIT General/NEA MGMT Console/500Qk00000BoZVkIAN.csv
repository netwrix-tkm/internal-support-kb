After rebooting the NEA server the console launches without issue, however this kills and currently running jobs.

This may be some network latency or other influence. Will need to correlate if current running jobs may correlate with the issue, any issues accessing SQL server during time issue is occurring such as through SSMS, or SQL server logs.
