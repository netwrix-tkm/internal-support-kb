Hey Nick,
Hope you had a nice weekend! A for logins, yes we would like to test out grabbing successful ones if possible. If it creates too much noise and data, we'll look to pull it back on some servers or all. So just let us know what sort of script modifications are needed for this and we can go from there.

Thanks !

Doug

No update on the perms yet. Dev is still sifting through our last results.

Did we get an update on the Logins?
I know we were kind of waiting for confirmation from you if you needed to capture the successful logins, as our job only collects failures at this point.

Thanks,

Bad news is it didn't actually get perms data. Kind of good news is that the timeout we see here is the same as we saw before. So more evidence for development at least.

I'll circle back with James in the morning for an update.
