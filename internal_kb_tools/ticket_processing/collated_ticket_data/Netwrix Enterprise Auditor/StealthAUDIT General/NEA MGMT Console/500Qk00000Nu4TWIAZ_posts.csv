If there is no way to determine this from UI navigation, then I'd like some help building a Job that can report such output. We have a very large number of hosts and host groups, and I've had several use cases for this information. The latest is that owner of a particular Host has been transferred to me without any historical context - other then it may be related to Netwrix. I would like to know which Host Groups the host is a member of so I make an assessment on if the Host was replaced, what Jobs run against it, if it is acting as a proxy for Auditing, and other such questions.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-10T12:08:04.000Z"
