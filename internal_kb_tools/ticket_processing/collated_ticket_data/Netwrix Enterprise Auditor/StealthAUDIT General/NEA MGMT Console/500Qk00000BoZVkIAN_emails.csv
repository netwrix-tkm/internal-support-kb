Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

	Found eight instances of SA crashing since May 2023, three since June 2024
	There was no additional information in Security and Maintenance
	Looking at the SQL logs and reports, it appears there is a database backup occurring at the time of the SA Console hangs
	There is AV on the SA Console server, but the necessary exclusions are in place


I'm going to review my findings with my team today to come up with next steps to prevent this from reoccurring. In the meantime, please check with your DBA on when that db backup kicks off and double check the AV exclusions.

Let me know if there are any more hang ups or issues!

Thank you,

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:

	Verified the console is now set to DEBUG
	Checked SQL logs for any related errors/actions
	Verified the job that was running during the time of the hang (FS Advanced > EMC > FSAC) completed successfully
	NEA system has 32GB RAM/8c CPU and is only used for NEA so shouldn't be a resource issue


If/when you run into the issue again, please let us know. We currently have the console in debug mode which should allow us to collect more information on the issue the next time it presents itself.

Hey Rick,

Can you please upload the logs from %SAInstallDir%SADatabaseLogsApplication to the ticket so we can take a look?

Here is a link so we can also get you scheduled for another remote session for us to continue investigating:

Hey Rick,

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:

  *   Verified the console is now set to DEBUG
  *   Checked SQL logs for any related errors/actions
  *   Verified the job that was running during the time of the hang (FS Advanced > EMC > FSAC) completed successfully
  *   NEA system has 32GB RAM/8c CPU and is only used for NEA so shouldn't be a resource issue

If/when you run into the issue again, please let us know. We currently have the console in debug mode which should allow us to collect more information on the issue the next time it presents itself.

Thank you,

Hey Rick,

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:

  *   Verified the console is now set to DEBUG
  *   Checked SQL logs for any related errors/actions
  *   Verified the job that was running during the time of the hang (FS Advanced > EMC > FSAC) completed successfully
  *   NEA system has 32GB RAM/8c CPU and is only used for NEA so shouldn't be a resource issue

If/when you run into the issue again, please let us know. We currently have the console in debug mode which should allow us to collect more information on the issue the next time it presents itself.

Thank you,

  *   Checked SQL logs for any related errors/actions
  *   Verified the job that was running during the time of the hang (FS Advanced > EMC > FSAC) completed successfully
  *   NEA system has 32GB RAM/8c CPU and is only used for NEA so shouldn't be a resource issue

If/when you run into the issue again, please let us know. We currently have the console in debug mode which should allow us to collect more information on the issue the next time it presents itself.

Thank you,

Hey Rick,

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:


	Verified the console is now set to DEBUG
	Checked SQL logs for any related errors/actions
	Verified the job that was running during the time of the hang (FS Advanced > EMC > FSAC) completed successfully
	NEA system has 32GB RAM/8c CPU and is only used for NEA so shouldn't be a resource issue



If/when you run into the issue again, please let us know. We currently have the console in debug mode which should allow us to collect more information on the issue the next time it presents itself.

Thank you,

If you navigate to the Settings > Application in StealthAUDIT, is the box for ""Usage Statistics"" checked?

Hey Rick,

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:

  *   Verified the console is now set to DEBUG
  *   Checked SQL logs for any related errors/actions
  *   Verified the job that was running during the time of the hang (FS Advanced > EMC > FSAC) completed successfully
  *   NEA system has 32GB RAM/8c CPU and is only used for NEA so shouldn't be a resource issue

If/when you run into the issue again, please let us know. We currently have the console in debug mode which should allow us to collect more information on the issue the next time it presents itself.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hey Rick,

Thank you for meeting with us today. To recap our session, we:


	Verified the console is now set to DEBUG
	Checked SQL logs for any related errors/actions
	Verified the job that was running during the time of the hang (FS Advanced > EMC > FSAC) completed successfully
	NEA system has 32GB RAM/8c CPU and is only used for NEA so shouldn't be a resource issue



If/when you run into the issue again, please let us know. We currently have the console in debug mode which should allow us to collect more information on the issue the next time it presents itself.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hey Rick,

Thank you for meeting with us today. Looks like the team thinks they have it figured out-

If you navigate to the Settings > Application in StealthAUDIT, is the box for ""Usage Statistics"" checked?

Thank you,
