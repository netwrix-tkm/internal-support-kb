Unfortunately, I have not received any confirmation from the internal teams.

My recommendation would be to Upgrade at least to the last 11.5 build if we cannot move to the current 11.6 version. 

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Sean,

Thank You for the update.

I started an internal communication with the R&D team.

If I recall correctly, this was a UI bug that was corrected in a later build of  Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA).

Once I get confirmation of this from them, I will reach out with our options.

Have a great weekend.

Again, thank You for your time.

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) 11.5.0.240

As directed by R&D we found that the Web UI was not able to load either in relation to the “hexadecimal value 0x00, is an invalid character. Line 1” error.

The correction was to rebuild the Reports Folder under the install path D:STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITReports  the original folder was renamed appending _03132025 to the end.
Closed and reopened the SA Console to rebuild the folder.

We then re-published the reports under the .Active Directory Inventory Job Group

	Publish – Publishes the reports from the selected job group or job without regenerating the report. See the Reporting topic for additional information.
	Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Navigating the Console > Navigation Pane > Jobs Tree Right-click Menus  > Jobs Tree Primary Nodes
	https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Navigate/Pane.htm 


Additional Reports can be re-published manually or rebuilt when the related Job completes next.
 
I will close out this ticket as we noted.

We have 30days to reopen once the closure email is received.

To reopen we can just reply to that email to bring the case back into my queue.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. 

Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link.

Have a great weekend.

Again, thank You for your time.
