Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, I was unable to uninstall and reinstall AIC. While trying to uninstall the AIC, we get an error message ""Windows is unable to stop the service for the Access Information Center""
I tried to disable the server, but that didn't work.
You rebooted the server that did not help.

Hello Frantz,

I was able to stop the service and remove the NAIC from the server and reinstall it. It looks like it working just fine. Don’t think we need to meet on Thursday unless you just want to check over a couple things.
