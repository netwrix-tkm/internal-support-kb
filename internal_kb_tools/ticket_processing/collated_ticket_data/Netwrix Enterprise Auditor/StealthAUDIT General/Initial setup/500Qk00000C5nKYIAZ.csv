"500Qk00000C5nKYIAZ","00412503","Support Ticket","Filesystem permissions report returning historical (old) data","Hello. We recently took over management of the EA tool. A customer of ours has advised us that there is some inconsistency between the permissions data in the tool and the actual filesystem. In particular, the EA data shows permission on a particular folder that does not exist on the filesystem. The customer is running a SQL query directly against the database (will attach the query to the ticket, but the corresponding published report also shows the permission data. So the data does not seem to be getting updated in the database. But since we only recently took ownership of the tool, we need assistance and guidance from Support in troubleshooting the issue. Requesting help from a support engineer to review the permission report and help us debug why the data is not being updated in the database as expected. I am attaching the SQL query for reference.

We identified that the sample file gathered was at least 5 levels deep but the configuration of the FSAA system scan was only scanning 3 levels deep. We also suggested a more optimized way of scanning deeper without hyper-extending the system scan times by utilizing the different FSAA scoping options.","Guidance","Scottie Taylor","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.6","","12.9","Closed - Resolved","John Deere Company","Scott Prigge","2024-06-20T18:16:02.000Z","2024-07-03T16:29:17.000Z"
