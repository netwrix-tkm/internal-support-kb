"00aQk000008Y6xeIAC","500Qk00000DpJsMIAV","We assigned a new cert to AIC and the Publish Report.
We were able to access the login page, but it says the page is not secure
I advised the customer to talk to the cert team or use a different certificate.
 
For the login access:
The default admin account for AIC was enabled but protected by a password.
I cleared the password from the config file to force the default admin and password to reactivate.
When logged in, the page goes directly to the Database configuration page with the error message ""Unable to connect to the  database, please review the settings below.""
 
The database is lock to a CLQ account ""StealthID"" and they don't know the password for it.
In StealthAUDIT, the database is set to use Windows auth.
I switched the AIC database to Window's auth, it's not working
 
The customer is looking for a way to log in to the AIC.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-08-15T17:01:21.000Z","2024-08-15T17:01:21.000Z","false","false"
