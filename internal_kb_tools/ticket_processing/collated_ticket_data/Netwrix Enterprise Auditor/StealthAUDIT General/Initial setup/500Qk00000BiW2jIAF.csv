"500Qk00000BiW2jIAF","00411652","Support Ticket","Blocking Database","ttached blocking in Stealthbits database on PGCOITDATA21 could block some other processes for up to 24 houso I didnâ€™t know how much the blocking affected the application or it was just a regular process.


If need, Can you please have someone get the comments from the vendor?","","","","Performed an investigation into the possible causes for SQL statements being blocked/deadlocked.  Identified that there could be multiple transactions occurring before one can complete which causes deadlocks/blocking. We suggested identifying which jobs are running and possibly prompting an error on the NEA server. 

Closing this ticket at the request of the customer while they perform more investigation into their SQL server as well as other SQL scripts correlating to jobs being run in NEA. The customer may reopen ticket at a later date.","Guidance","Scottie Taylor","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.0","","7.0","Closed - Resolved","Prince George's County, Maryland","William Addis","2024-06-11T18:54:58.000Z","2024-06-18T20:00:14.000Z"
