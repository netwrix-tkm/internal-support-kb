Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We discovered that there were duplicate entries under the sa_database_id column which was creating the error presented in this ticket. We removed the duplicate entries and reran the Oracle permissions scan. 

Please let me know the results of the scan and if the same errors are still present after making the necessary changes. 

Thank you,
