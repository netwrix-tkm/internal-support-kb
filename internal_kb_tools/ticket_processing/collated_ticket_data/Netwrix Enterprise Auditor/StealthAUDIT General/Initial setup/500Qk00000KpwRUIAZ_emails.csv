Thank you for your reply. I am glad to hear I was able to assist with your request. 

The following is a summary of the ticket for your records:

According to conversation with Profession Services team the Job group (job folder) consists of these two jobs:“1.GetHostList1” and “GetHostShares1” jobs.
These jobs must be configured with the following host lists settings:

“1.GetHostList1” - this job must be configured with ""GET SHARE WIN"" list (with list of servers for scanning).
“GetHostShares1” - this job must have its own separate ""hosts"" settings. for this job you must add only StealthAudit server (AZITSBITS01). 

These jobs will produce a ""Hosts"" table. The ""HOST"" column within that table shows a server from which the PowerShell job ""GetHostShares1"" was running from.
If there are multiple servers there - then you must check the ""HostList"" of the ""GetHostShares1"" job to see which servers are added there. This HostList (for the ""GetHostShares1"" job) should only have StealthAudit server. 

The ""Remark"" column will show text that was added to the comments when the Windows Share was created.  

The final report does not show which shares are newly found and which were already found during previous job run. Currently the ""GetHostShares1"" job does not have such functionality. 

The ShareType column represents the type of share that was identified during job processing:

This is most likely related to the Microsoft Windows types of shares, which are the following:


	
		
			0 (Admin)
			Hidden shares used for system administration
			C$, Admin$, IPC$, Print$
		
	



	
		
			1 (Default)
			User-created file shares for general use
			Documents, Public
		
	



	
		
			2 (Printer)
			Shares for printers
			Printer share (e.g., HP_Printer)
		
	



	
		
			3 (Special)
			Non-standard, specialized shares
			Mailslot, service-specific shares
		
	


Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return.
