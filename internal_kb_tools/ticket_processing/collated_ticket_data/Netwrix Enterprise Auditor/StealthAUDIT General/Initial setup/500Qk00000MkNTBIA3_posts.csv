We are upgrading the Windows server Operating System to Version 2022 in our system. We wanted to know does our products like Stealthaudit, Defend and SAm are compatible with the version or do we need to upgrade for 2022 OS version.

Appreciate your valuable feedback on the same.

Thanks and Regards,
