"500Qk00000EDwXdIAL","00417682","Support Ticket","Renewing Certs for websites - after new Root domain CA issued with 11.6 of StealthAudit","Hello, I'd like some guidance on updating certs on the latest and greatest StealthAudit application. We had an internal CA issue new root cert, so anything with old cert will no longer be functional in near future. Hence we need to re-issue certs with the updated root CA built in.

I'm just not fully confident in doing this on the upgraded version. Thanks","","","","The customer opened this ticket because he thought he had a certificate issue and realized there was no cert issue. We're closing this ticket as solved.","Guidance","Frantz Baptiste","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.6","","3.1","Closed - Resolved","MISO Energy","Patrick Sager","2024-08-09T14:14:12.000Z","2024-08-12T17:17:06.000Z"
