Ian, would it be possible to re-open this case? I have a new certificate in P7B format which I've imported to the certificate store. However, when I run the powershell script you provided, I am getting this error:

SSL Certificate update failed, Error: 1312
A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated.

I've been googling, converting to different formats, and I can't seem to find the right sequence of commands. If re-opening this ticket is not possible, just let me know and I'll open a new ticket.

Sorry Ian, you can disregard, there is no need to re-open this case. I figured it out. I had problems importing the certificate because it was not created with the Microsoft certificate utilities. But eventually I was able to import the cert with the private key and that fixed the Powershell error. Then I restarted the service and I can see the new cert. Sorry to bother you.

That's an easy fix! You can't bind a new certificate to that port without removing the one already there.

You'll need to run this line first:
netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8082

Then you can bind the new certificate for the published reports. To do the same for the AIC, just change that 8082 to 481.

More on this here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000ITtCAM.html

Let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you,
