"500Qk00000L65SUIAZ","00433602","Support Ticket","POC for FRANMAX","Hello,

We're running AUDITOR poc for Lithuanian customer FRANMAX.
Generally they are interested in AD audit only. Since they have 15k users + 8 domain controllers in 4 countries:

What would be advantages and disadvantages of using ENTERPRISE AUDITOR? Is there any comparison that we could read or watch?

For now AUDITOR seems a bit too basic and they are interested almost in custom filters / customer reports and custom alerts.","> This is a great ticket without actual reproduction steps
