Hello Ganesan,

Since you have Windows authentication and if you are not going to change users under the database - you can change owner.

Hello Ganesan,

The ticket was re-assigned to me. The DB owner was assigned to databases when it was created during the StealthAUDIT/StealthINTERCEPT installation process.

What user do you have assigned for the StealthAUDIT database:

Hello Ganesan, 

Since you have Windows authentication and if you are not going to change users under the database - you can change owner. 

Thank you!

Hello Ganesan, 

The ticket was re-assigned to me. The DB owner was assigned to databases when it was created during the StealthAUDIT/StealthINTERCEPT installation process. 

What user do you have assigned for the StealthAUDIT database:

Hello Ganesan,

The ticket was re-assigned to me. The DB owner was assigned to databases when it was created during the StealthAUDIT/StealthINTERCEPT installation process.

What user do you have assigned for the StealthAUDIT database:
