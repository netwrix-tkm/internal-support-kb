I suspect it is our ""phantom"" ini file issue most likely. May have to wipe and redeploy the agent in order for it to correct the path to the log files. Make sure if you go that route to back up the data in the SBTFILEMON logs folder","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-06-27T13:11:42.000Z","2024-06-27T13:11:42.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000007g6RaIAI","500Qk00000CM6PfIAL","Discovered that the FSAC system scan job was completed with warnings. The warning stated a network path was not found an issue where the account used to access the activity log could not properly access the file path location. We also discovered that the file path was incorrectly assigned to the agent monitoring the activity. Once we made the change to the listed file path and updated it with the correct one we then ran the FSAC system scan job again and were successfully able to scan that host.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-07-01T21:45:15.000Z","2024-07-01T21:45:15.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000007rC73IAE","500Qk00000CM6PfIAL","Discovered that the agents associated with the hosts in the FSAC system scan job were not configured to be monitored with the NAM console. Configured those agents to be monitored so that the FSAC system scan can properly run. Also identified that another FSAC system scan job needed to be run again because a previous scan required a bulk import to run. Successfully ran the system and awaiting results of the bulk import.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-07-10T21:50:41.000Z","2024-07-10T21:50:41.000Z","false","false"
