Hello Scottie,

You’re welcome. Thanks for the quick response to my ticket submission.

Good question. No. The errors I shared were received prior to ending the SA task via Task Manager. After ending the SA task via Task Manager and attempting to reopen my SA console I get stuck here:

[cid:image001.png@01DAD2DE.2539D250]

I think this may indicate many jobs are currently in progress. Please correct me if I am wrong.

I cannot open my console. Luckily I do not have any issues accessing my AIC.

Hello Scottie,

I was able to get the console to open a moment ago. No error messages popping up for me anymore.

Please feel free to close out my ticket. Thank you, sir.

Respectfully,
Sean

Makes sense. Okay. I will attempt to open again and let it sit. How long should I wait before going to the next step you recommended?

At this point, the only thing you can do is wait until it establishes a connection with the SQL server. Usually it displays an error message if a connection could not be established. If that happens then testing a connection between the NEA server and SQL server is the next step.

Hello Scottie,

You’re welcome. Thanks for the quick response to my ticket submission.

Good question. No. The errors I shared were received prior to ending the SA task via Task Manager. After ending the SA task via Task Manager and attempting to reopen my SA console I get stuck here:

[cid:image001.png@01DAD302.02BC2150]

I think this may indicate many jobs are currently in progress. Please correct me if I am wrong.

I cannot open my console. Luckily I do not have any issues accessing my AIC.

Respectfully,
Sean

Hi Sean,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. After receiving that error message did completely close the NEA console and end the StealthAudit.exe task within the task manager before re-opening the console?

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

To clarify I had no issues on Friday. I left my computer and my RDP session I had open to access my SA console expired. I then remoted back into the same PAM account I use to get to my console.. Then got the top error in the screenshot I attached to my ticket... I then clicked OK. I then got the bottom error .

Damus, a fellow SB admin at my organization, did not get this error on his side. But he was logged in to the instance under a different PAM account. Curious if my suspicion is valid or if there are bigger issues that could be in my SA environment. Thanks[Image removed by sender.]
