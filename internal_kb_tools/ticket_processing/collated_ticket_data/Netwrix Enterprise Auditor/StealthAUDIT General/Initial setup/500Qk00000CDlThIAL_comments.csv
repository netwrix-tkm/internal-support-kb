We noticed some jobs failed but have not failed because of the upgrade.
We noticed the number of threats assigned to the job (4 threats) and suspected that could be one reason why it was taking longer to run. 
We agreed to increase it to 8 to see if that made any difference. 
I will review the log to see if there is anything related to the increase in time.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-06-25T23:32:08.000Z","2024-06-25T23:32:08.000Z","false","false"
