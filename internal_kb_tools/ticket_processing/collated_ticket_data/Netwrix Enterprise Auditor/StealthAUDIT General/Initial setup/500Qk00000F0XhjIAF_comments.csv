We got some errors related to the installation of the Microsoft Graft Module.
We tried running the PowerShell script related to the Microsoft Graft Module section manually, but it still failed.
We will review the error in the next meeting and try to set it up manually.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-09-05T23:11:40.000Z","2024-09-05T23:11:40.000Z","false","false"

We created a new connection profile in StealthAUDIT and plugged the new Client ID and the Key into the new profile.
We assigned the new profile to the Entra ID Inventory job, which ran successfully.
We tested a few jobs under the Entra ID group, and they ran successfully.
We scheduled the Entra ID group to run. The customer will reply to this email to provide an update on the Entra ID group.
