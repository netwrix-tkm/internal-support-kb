Customer reported that recently RAM utilization on SQL server for Netwrix Access Analyzer was increased. 

I asked customer to provide more details and here is their reply:
     1. You are currently experiencing 90% RAM utilization on the SQL server for for Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor). Is that correct? Yes
    2. Do you have a dedicated/separate SQL server for Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) database? Or application and SQL server are located on the same machine? Separate database server
    3. How much RAM and CPU resources does your SQL server have? 8 cores and 36GB RAM
    4. Why 90% RAM usage on SQL server is unexpected to you? Was RAM usage lower previously? yes
    5. If the RAM usage was different before - what has changed in the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) application? Did you configure a new job/solution recently? No but recently lots of jobs were enabled where it was disabled previously

Asking customer which jobs were enabled recently and which jobs exactly are running right now.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-04-17T08:54:48.000Z"

Also, customer did not provide NAA build number. 
Need to ask them one more time to run this: 
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-04-17T08:57:24.000Z"
