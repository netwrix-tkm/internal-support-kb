The customer will contact the admin to ensure he is a member of the domain admin group from the domain controller he wants to query.
He will also contact his Azure admin to clarify his Azure permission access level.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-09-04T19:09:28.000Z","2024-09-04T19:09:28.000Z","false","false"
