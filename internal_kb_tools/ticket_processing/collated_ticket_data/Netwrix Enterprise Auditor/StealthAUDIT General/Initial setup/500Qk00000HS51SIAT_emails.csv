Thank you Mike.  I've scheduled for next Friday.


Update on today's Exchange:
Job ""EX_Perms"" has ran, did not get previous permissions error (after we updated HGIC permissions in EAC/Entra).
We did get several other errors after running 32m 56s:

Many other errors (from what appears to be all disabled users/revoked E5 licensing/ mailboxes changed to Shared Mailboxes-for compliance retention):
Approx. 166 errors relating to disabled users similar to below:
""UserDN could not be obtained for mailbox 'Rebecca DeCastell<rdecastell@polarahealth.com>': Error getting user settings (InvalidUser): Invalid user 'rdecastell@polarahealth.com' specified. ""

  Thank you Mike.  I've scheduled for next Friday.

 

 

Update on today's Exchange:

Job ""EX_Perms"" has ran, did not get previous permissions error (after we updated HGIC permissions in EAC/Entra).

We did get several other errors after running 32m 56s:

Many other errors (from what appears to be all disabled users/revoked E5 licensing/ mailboxes changed to Shared Mailboxes-for compliance retention):

Approx. 166 errors relating to disabled users similar to below:

 

""UserDN could not be obtained for mailbox 'Rebecca DeCastell<rdecastell@polarahealth.com>': Error getting user settings (InvalidUser): Invalid user 'rdecastell@polarahealth.com' specified. ""

  Thank you Mike.  I've scheduled for next Friday.

 

 

Update on today's Exchange:

Job ""EX_Perms"" has ran, did not get previous permissions error (after we updated HGIC permissions in EAC/Entra).

We did get several other errors after running 32m 56s:

 

'HGIC@polarahealth.com' - Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.Data.ServiceRequestException: The request failed. The remote server returned an error: (503) Server Unavailable. ---> System.Net.WebException: The remote server returned an error: (503) Server Unavailable.

   at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.EwsMailbox.Tasks.MailboxPermissionTask.<>c__DisplayClass8_0.<ProcessMailboxes>b__1(MailboxInfo mbxInfo)

 

 

 

Many other errors (from what appears to be all disabled users/revoked E5 licensing/ mailboxes changed to Shared Mailboxes-for compliance retention):

Approx. 166 errors relating to disabled users similar to below:

 

""UserDN could not be obtained for mailbox 'Rebecca DeCastell<rdecastell@polarahealth.com>': Error getting user settings (InvalidUser): Invalid user 'rdecastell@polarahealth.com' specified. ""
