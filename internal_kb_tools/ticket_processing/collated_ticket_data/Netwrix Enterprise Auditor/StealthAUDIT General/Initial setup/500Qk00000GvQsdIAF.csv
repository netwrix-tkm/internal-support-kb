1) At some point since your upgrade from StealthAUDIT 11.5 to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6, your CDSA job started failing.

2) Today on a call with Josh and I, we made a new instance of your CDSA job called ""CDSA1"", we ran it without error and it generated the 3 PowerPoint presentation (*.pptx) files into your Groups_zCDSA folder (or therabouts).

3) You opened the ""StealthAUDIT_CDSA_Template.pptx"" (or ""Netwrix_CDSA_Template.pptx"" equivalent) on your laptop and the report was populated correctly to the best of our knowledge.","Guidance","Mike Candon","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.6","","20.1","Closed - Resolved","Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe","Amy Gates","2024-10-11T15:09:06.000Z","2024-10-31T18:20:20.000Z"
