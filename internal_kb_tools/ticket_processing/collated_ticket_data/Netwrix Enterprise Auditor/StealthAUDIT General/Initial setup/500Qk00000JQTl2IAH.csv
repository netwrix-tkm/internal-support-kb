"500Qk00000JQTl2IAH","00429711","Support Ticket","Unable to configure host on a seek job","Reference ticket 00424345...working with previous engineer who assisted with setting up multiple seek jobs with different hosts.  The issue now is that when i configure v2 scan with the noted hosts if replicates to scan_v3 & scan_v4 respectively. even if i switch and configure scan_v3 with a different host it will sync to the other 2 scans that previous engineer walked me thru.","","Cause:
Unknown, suspect that the .xml files with the copied job would not correctly update thus making the console display the last edited host.","","Symptom:
Duplicated jobs keep replacing the Individual hosts with the last edited for all prior renamed duplicated jobs.
Cause:
Unknown, suspect that the .xml files with the copied job would not correctly update thus making the console display the last edited host.
Resolution:
Had to clear out the initial Job copies (deleted from the left menu this also cleared data for these jobs from the SQL back end). 
1.	Copied the Canned job from the install folder (%sainstalldir%) “E:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITInstantSolutionsGROUP_FileSystemGROUP_0.CollectionJOB_1-SEEK System Scans”
2.	Closed the Console
3.	Pasted the JOB_1-SEEK System Scans into the Jobs folder path “E:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobsGROUP_FileSystemGROUP_0.Collection”
4.	Renamed JOB_1-SEEK System Scans with the Regions abbreviation (example JOB_1-SEEK System Scan_NYC)
5.	Renamed the JOB_1-SEEK System Scans.XML with the Regions abbreviation (example JOB_1-SEEK System Scan_NYC.XML)
6.	Repeated for the other Cluster host.
7.	Launched the NEA Console.
8.	Corrected the Concurrent Worker Threads from the Default 10 to 4 (Dev recommendations) 
9.	Updated the needed Scoping for the Scan.

Then we were able to utilize an existing report to filter down to the needed Host. (If issues arise we will spin off a new case for this)
