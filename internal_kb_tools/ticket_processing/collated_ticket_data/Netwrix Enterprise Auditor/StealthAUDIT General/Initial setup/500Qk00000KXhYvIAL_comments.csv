@Ethan Israel @Michael Burrofato @WaitingOnEngineer

The NEA doesn't refresh the host if the host is updated recently or in a time range that is configured in Settings > Host Inventory > Only refresh inventory items older than. By default, this value is 60 days. 


That means if the host is updated in the last 60 days then it will be skipped and you can see the below message for a few hosts in the log file provided by the customer.

""Host not added because last update is too recent: PSQLA581WLST1 - 1/8/2025 2:42:52 PM""

You can set it lower so the application picks it up.

@Ethan Israel @Helen Randall @Michael Burrofato @Salesforce

I can reproduce the issue in 11.6 ( the below message) but this is fixed in 12.0 as part of the scheduler refactor ticket. So we need to merge just the fix down to 11.6.

""Host not added because the queue is not active""
