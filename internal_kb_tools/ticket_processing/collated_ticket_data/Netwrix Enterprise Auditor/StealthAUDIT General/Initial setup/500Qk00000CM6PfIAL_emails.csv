Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Discovered that the FSAC system scan job was completed with warnings. The warning stated a network path was not found an issue where the account used to access the activity log could not properly access the file path location. We also discovered that the file path was incorrectly assigned to the agent monitoring the activity. Once we made the change to the listed file path and updated it with the correct one we then ran the FSAC system scan job again and were successfully able to scan that host. 

I am glad that this was able to get your issue resolved. Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Discovered that the agents associated with the hosts in the FSAC system scan job were not configured to be monitored with the NAM console. Configured those agents to be monitored so that the FSAC system scan can properly run. Also identified that another FSAC system scan job needed to be run again because a previous scan required a bulk import to run. Successfully ran the system and awaiting results of the bulk import. 

Please let me know the results of the FSAC system scan.

Thank you,

They’re not separate issues. The goal of the ticket was to get file share activity working, and there are still errors on those jobs.

I would like to have another remote session to go over some more errors I’m seeing in the jobs.

Dear Benjamin,

I wanted to follow up because I have not heard from you since my last email. May I ask what the current status of the issue is?

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance on this case.

Regards,
