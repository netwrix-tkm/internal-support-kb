1) In your ""CDSA_logs.tsa"" log, do you specifically know which module the failures are associated with?

2) You recently upgraded from NEA 11.5 to 11.6 and there is a new version of this CDSA instant job in 11.6.
Did you already try to replace the old version of the job with the new version of the job?

I have attached a few screenshots on how to ""Add Instant Job"" for the CDSA Job:

""SS01_NEA_Jobs_Add_Instant_Job_SS01_2024-10-11_142250.png""
""SS02_NEA_Instant_Job_Wizard__CDSA__Next_SS_2024-10-11_142353.png""

Here are links to some of the documentation for the CDSA Job and Instant Jobs:

3) To Turn on DEBUG, right-click on the ""CDSA"" Job in NEA, scroll to the bottom of the list and select ""Properties"" 
and in the ""Job Properties"" popup screen change the Log Level to ""DEBUG"" from the default of ""WARNING"".  Then re-run the CDSA job.
