Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. Performed an investigation into the possible causes for SQL statements being blocked/deadlocked.  Identified that there could be multiple transactions occurring before one can complete which causes deadlocks/blocking. We suggested identifying which jobs are running and possible prompting an error on the NEA server. I will close this ticket at your request. If you would like to reopen this ticket you have the option too within 30 days.

Thank you,

Thank you,
