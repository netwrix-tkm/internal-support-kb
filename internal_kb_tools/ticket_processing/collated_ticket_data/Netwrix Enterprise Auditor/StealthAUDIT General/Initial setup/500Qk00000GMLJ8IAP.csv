We're in the middle of a really important government bid that involves primarily Netwrix Auditor and NEA. We have some questions that are crucial for participating in this process. Could you please get the following answers for us?

1: Is there any way we can get information in real time or with a gap of less than 24
hours (notifications and/or schedules)? 

2: Is it possible to detect data sharing activities (who, when, where) with NEA or NA?

3: Do ""Actions"" are executed only when the report is run/scheduled, or it take action as soon as some change occured? 

4: Can NA or NEA be integrated with threat intelligence/response platforms via API or other ways?

6: Is it possible to audit an object's owner change via NA or NEA?

7: Does NA or NEA use “journaling” or “diagnostics” when auditing Microsoft Exchange?

8: Can NA or NEA audit firewall and other perimeter tools?

9: NEA is able to monitor real-time attempts of cybercriminal intrusions? If so, how?


The questions include NA, but it's not a problem at all if the answers are specific to NEA.","","","","Sales Demo needed for Application functionality.","Guidance","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.6","","2.9","Closed - Resolved","AIQON Servicos em Informatica LTDA - MSP","Rafael Zacarias","2024-09-27T18:28:54.000Z","2024-09-30T15:14:45.000Z"
