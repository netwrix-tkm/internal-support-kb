I just wanted to reach out from the support ticket and provide you a link where you can upload the artifacts that were requested by R&D.

https://www.netwrix.com/sign_in.html?rf=my_tickets.html

After following the link above and logging in, from your ""My Tickets"" page you'll be able to expand the 00415128 ticket and you should see a small '+' button near the bottom that can be used to attach the artifacts.

Please let me know if you have any issues with the attachment process. If you could provide an update once those are available so that I may make our development team aware that would be appreciated.


Regards,

Kurt Gerth
Technical Support Team Lead
