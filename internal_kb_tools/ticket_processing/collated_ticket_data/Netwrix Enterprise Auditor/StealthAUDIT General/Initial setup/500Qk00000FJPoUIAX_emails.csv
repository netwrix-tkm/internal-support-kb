You can close this one. I know now, why it fails. It happens when it gets interrupted during the bulk import or when the database tempdb runs out of disk space. Re-running the Bulk Import and then running the schedule from the beginning solves the issue. Might be a bug in the new version, because being interrupted in the previous versions did not result in the job failing every time from that moment forward.

Hi Brandon,

There definitely was conflict with jobs that I believe I have addressed for the most part, but it is a constant struggle. Part of the issue was scheduling the jobs properly, but another issue is how long some of the jobs take to run. I got everything caught up only for the job to fail again and cause me to have to start the catch up process all over again.

Share point took over 2 weeks to process last time and to be honest I am not even sure it was successful. There were a lot of errors but it did continue on to the next job and eventually ran through the whole set. The SPSEEK job alone took up a good majority of that time and honestly I don’t remember it ever taking that long. But maybe its working now and wasn’t before. I have no idea.

The on-prem file share seek job doesn’t work at all. I didn’t even put in a support ticket  for that, since we were already dealing with other issues.

As mentioned before I think this entire environment needs to be looked at and given a health check I can fix issues and keep everything moving but it’s starting to become a full time job. With jobs taking over a week or more to complete and not being able to run together, I fall behind and then spend my time trying to catch up on all the daily jobs that have not run for a week or more.

I said to close this ticket because I know why the activity job is failing and how to fix it, but we probably want to open a generic ticket that will allow someone to go through the entire system and get everything working as expected again.

Adjust scheduled jobs to avoid conflict causing Out of Mem issue. 

Need to understand as to why there are interrupts (where/are these from NEA or 3rd party) during the bulk import, Support is aware that if the NEA jobs do not complete correctly the database tempdb will not clear out which will result in the SQL host running out of disk space
