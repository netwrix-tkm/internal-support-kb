Are you moving those files to another server or within a server?

Was it working before with the Chinese characters in files?

What are your language settings on StealthAUDIT server?

The current ticket was re-assigned to me. I can see that the version of StealthAUDIT is set to 11.0. Please clarify a build number.

You can execute the following PowerShell script on the StealthAUDIT console server to check the build number:

#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize

As I can see from the bug fix document - there was an enhancement that can be related to the issue.
