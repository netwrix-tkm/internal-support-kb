Customer needs additional assistance from professional services team to configure the ""GetHostShares1"" job so that it only shows single server in the ""HOST"" column in the resulting table. 

I have sent a request to profession services team and to Kyle Vogley (Kyndryl Company Account owner) in this email thread:
RE: Kyndryl | Netwrix Enterprise Auditor | Questions about custom job for discovering Shares on Windows hosts 

In the meantime, will ask customer to provide ""hosts"" settings for “1.GetHostList1” and “GetHostShares1” jobs.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-02-25T15:14:35.000Z"
