Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
My name is Artem and I will be assisting you with this ticket.

According to latest information from our Netwrix Access Analyzer help center this is provided as SQL Server Requirements:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Overview.htm
 

The server requirements include one of the following SQL Server versions:


	
	SQL Server 2016 through SQL Server 2022
	
	
	Azure SQL Managed Instances
	


Additionally the server must meet this requirement:


	
	US English language installation
	
	 
	


As such, whether it is as VM in Azure cloud that is running SQL server instance, or if it is an Azure SQL Managed Instance - both are suitable as a SQL database server.

Please, let me know if this answers your question or if there is anything else I can assist you with.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
Technical Support Engineer EMEA
