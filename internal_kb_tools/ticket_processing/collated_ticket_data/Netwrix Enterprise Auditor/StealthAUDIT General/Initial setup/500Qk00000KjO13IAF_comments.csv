@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer Can you provide the input.db file for the action?

if you are referring to the customers environment. 
I can replicate this exactly with no .DB file.

This folder has all that my server creates. My set up is same as customer where we target our Own NEA App server.

Here is the result of a successful action and error message in the results.

Customer is apprehensive of using this on a large scale, if they can't trust the job results.
They are trying to use this to purge malicious files.","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2025-02-11T20:43:39.000Z","2025-02-11T21:09:59.000Z","false","false"

@Salesforce
There should be an input.db file located at:

STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFileSystemAMDatasession-yyyymmddThhmmssinput.db
Or it can be located as previously mentioned here
StealthbitsStealthAUDITActionsFileSystemyyyymmddThhmmssHOST.input1.db


Every action execution produces that input.db so if it's not there in either location someone may have deleted it.

We want to get that input.db file so we can validate whether the action is targeting the directory or the file because this looks very similar to another issue we had with a different customer (https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce.com/500Qk00000IlzH1IAJ) and the resolution would be to update the action to target the file rather than the folder.
