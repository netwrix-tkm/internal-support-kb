We are currently having an issue with NAIC, Whenever we try to login to the gui it gives the following error ""Unable to use to the SQL Server Database provided"" We checked the SQL that its connected to it and it seems fine. Could you guys give it a look?

Thanks,","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-10-31T14:18:56.000Z"
