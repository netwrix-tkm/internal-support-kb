Thank you for contacting Netwrix technical support. I've reviewed your account, and I don't see any licensing for Netwrix Auditor.

It looks like you are currently licensed for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (formerly StealthAUDIT) and Netwrix Activity Monitor.

If you believe this to be incorrect, I'd be happy to loop in your account owner.

Hi Tay
I was in contact with Sean about this and from what he said it sounds like we should be able to get these.

The account lockout reporting is a function within our Netwrix Auditor product line which your manager probably saw on our website.  But with what you currently own today Netwrix Enterprise Auditor for AD and AD Activity Monitoring you would be able to populate account lockout reports.  Please let me know if this helps and if you would like to schedule some time next week to look through it.  Thank you.

I assumed from this that the Netwrix Auditor and Netwrix Enterprise Auditor were the same thing and that we could use this. I may be very wrong though.

Thanks

Jason

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and Netwrix Auditor are 2 different products we offer.


	Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (formerly StealthAUDIT): https://www.netwrix.com/enterprise-auditor.html
	Netwrix Auditor: https://www.netwrix.com/auditor.html


However, I believe what Sean was trying to convey is that Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and Netwrix Activity Monitor already has this function built-in so another product shouldn't be necessary. In NEA, under the Active Directory > 6. Activity > Lockouts you should find the AD_Lockouts job and this should accomplish what you are looking for.

Let me know if you have any additional questions!

Thank you,

Oh OK, that makes sense. I was hoping that it would give more information. In the tool it says it can tell us things like where it was locked out from and such. Seems that this cannot do that.
Oh well.

You can close this ticket.
