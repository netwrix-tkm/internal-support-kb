Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we tried to run the AADI_RegisterAzureAppAuth to create the Entra Inventory.
We ran some PowerShell commands to install Microsoft Graph, NuGet, and the Azure Module.
We are getting an error when running the AADI_RegisterAzureAppAuth because the user account cannot communicate properly with the tenant, and we believe it has to do with Okta.
You will work with your internal team on the permission issue and reschedule the meeting.
