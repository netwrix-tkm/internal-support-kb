1. Setup and Calculate - checks the non-compliant accounts
2. Get Status - gets the status of the tickets relating to the item 1 above
3. Create new ticket based on the results of item 2 above.

Now since job 2 showed only 1 result, job 3 creates duplicate tickets even if there are existing ticket for the account in item 1.

Attached are the logs.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-16T15:20:43.000Z"

As per customer, they are seeing duplicate tickets getting generated. As far as I have observed, they have copied over the same job and made it a part of custom Job Group (folder). I have asked them a number of questions apart from standard template in my initial response to assess the situation if it requires support help or PSO:

From the screenshot image you have shared, it appears that the solution/jobs you are running are not default jobs and are rather custom built. Please confirm if it is the case?
What is expected output of the job?
Are you running the production environment jobs i.e., BM as well while connected to test DB via scheduled task?
What is the status of same jobs in your production environment?","","","","005Qk00000214EvIAI","2025-03-17T06:40:57.000Z"
