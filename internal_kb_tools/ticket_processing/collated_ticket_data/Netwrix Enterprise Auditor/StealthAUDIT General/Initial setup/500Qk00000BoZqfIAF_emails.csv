Hi Gregory,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, I confirmed the issue occurs when we try and view the Host List at the group level. When you have a chance, please upload the SQL script used to update host names as well as the Application logs located at %SAInstallDir%SADatabaseLogs

Thank you,

I'm not sure why I'm not seeing it on my side. There's a potential that our spamfilter grabbed it, but I don't see it in quarantine for me to review. Would you mind sending it again?

I believe our next step would be to uninstall the current console, and reinstall after verifying the installer is not blocked via File Properties. If you wish to do this together on a call, please let me know and I'd be happy to send you a meeting scheduling link.

Thank you,

Hi Gregory,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, I confirmed the issue occurs when we try and view the Host List at the group level. When you have a chance, please upload the SQL script used to update host names as well as the Application logs located at %SAInstallDir%SADatabaseLogs

Thank you,

Hey Gregory,

I'm not sure why I'm not seeing it on my side. There's a potential that our spamfilter grabbed it, but I don't see it in quarantine for me to review. Would you mind sending it again?

I believe our next step would be to uninstall the current console, and reinstall after verifying the installer is not blocked via File Properties. If you wish to do this together on a call, please let me know and I'd be happy to send you a meeting scheduling link.

Thank you,

Hey Gregory,

I'm not sure why I'm not seeing it on my side. There's a potential that our spamfilter grabbed it, but I don't see it in quarantine for me to review. Would you mind sending it again?

I believe our next step would be to uninstall the current console, and reinstall after verifying the installer is not blocked via File Properties. If you wish to do this together on a call, please let me know and I'd be happy to send you a meeting scheduling link.

Thank you,

Hey Greg,

Could I please get you to try uploading those app logs again? Not sure what happened, but I'm only seeing the SQL stuff.

Hi Gregory,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, I confirmed the issue occurs when we try and view the Host List at the group level. When you have a chance, please upload the SQL script used to update host names as well as the Application logs located at %SAInstallDir%SADatabaseLogs

Thank you,
