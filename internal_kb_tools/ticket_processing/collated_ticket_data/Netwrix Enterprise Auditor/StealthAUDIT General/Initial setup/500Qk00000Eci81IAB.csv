I am requesting assistance with the ""Published Reports"" icons, as it not functioning. I am unable to create reports for my senior management team. 
Also, I am requesting assistance with creating an automated report from our STEALTHBits Audit Server. This report should be automatically emailed every 60 days to certain stakeholders in my organization and should display the user breakdown for the following folders: SFTPPRD3 & SFTPPRD4. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
Respectfully,
