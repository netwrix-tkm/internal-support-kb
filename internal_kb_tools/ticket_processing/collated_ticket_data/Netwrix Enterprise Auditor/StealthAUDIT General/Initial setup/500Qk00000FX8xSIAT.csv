"500Qk00000FX8xSIAT","00420465","Support Ticket","Sql data needs to be purged","We recently received a disk space alert for our data drive for the sql server.  I asked for disk space report and was provided the following details: 
tempdb occupied 1.2 TB and StealthAudit database occupied 1.3 TB in E: drive

How do i go about trimming/purging stale data within the noted databases to reclaim the space for that drive.","","","","Symptom:
Alert: Received for disk space on the SQL server data drive.

Objective: Reclaim space on the E: drive by trimming or purging stale data within the tempdb and StealthAudit databases.
Cause:
Disk Space issue:
    tempdb: Occupied 1.2 TB.
    StealthAudit database: Occupied 1.3 TB.
Resolution:

Confirmed that the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) SQL DB did have some old data for host that are no longer active.

For this we created a zSandBox job for FSAA Drop Data.
REF: Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Data Collectors > FileSystemAccess Data Collector > FSAA: Query Selection > Maintenance options: Remove Host Data
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/QuerySelection.htm

Created a New Host List (Drop host list) via the Import option and pointing to our temp text file.
REF: Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.6 > Administration > Host Management > Host Management Activities > Import Hosts Option
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/HostManagement/Actions/ImportHost.htm  

From there were can spot check for any remnants of the host via the following TSQL 
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM SA_FSAA_ResourcesView  
WHERE HostName Like '<HOST IN QUESTION>%'

Once the clean up completes the DBAs can shrink the DB to recover the needed diskspace.","Guidance","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.6","69","38.0","Closed - Resolved","Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC","Damus Aulu","2024-09-09T19:11:15.000Z","2024-10-17T18:53:58.000Z"
