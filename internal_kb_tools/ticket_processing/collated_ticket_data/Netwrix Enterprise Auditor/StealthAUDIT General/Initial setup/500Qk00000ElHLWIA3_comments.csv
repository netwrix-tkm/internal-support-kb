We investigated the Foreign Key constraint and the columns and table relationships and identified that the SPAA_Hosts table was listed as a compatible table for the JOIN statement. We then updated the USN value of the host within the SPAA_Hosts table using the below SQL command:

UPDATE dbo.SA_SPAA_Hosts
SET USN = 0

and reran the SPAC Bulk Import job. The changes we made to the USN value did not resolve the bulk import error and it persisted. 

We gathered the job jogs and identified that the SPAC T2s were about 28 GBs in size. I will start the escalation process of this issue.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-09-04T17:39:05.000Z","2024-09-04T17:39:05.000Z","false","false"
