report on permission change activity not updating

found activity change report not updating

Cause

No Root Cause


Resolution

Since the change was made at the top level in AD that change was reported in the ADI scan but not the FSAA system scan. We determined that this functions as expected and a change would need to be made at the file share level to report on file permission changes.","Guidance","Scottie Taylor","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.5","","5.8","Closed - Resolved","Daimler Trucks North America LLC","john anunsen","2024-08-30T21:21:21.000Z","2024-09-05T17:38:02.000Z"
