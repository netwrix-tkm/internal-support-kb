We need assistance scoping our infrastructure in the new domain (server configuration / service accounts, etc.). Then we need assistance installing products and then configuring them for the new domain.</p><p> </p><p><b>Resolution Notes:  </b>The customer is not planning to migrate any data; he wants to create a new environment with a new DC and SQL server.</p><p>I explained to the customer that he would need to follow the new environment&#39;s guidelines to ensure proper permission is created for each server.</p><p>Since it&#39;s a new install, no migration is involved. I will close this ticket, and the customer will open a new ticket when ready to install NEA in the new server.</p>","","","","00570000003KXurAAG","2025-03-13T12:42:32.000Z"
