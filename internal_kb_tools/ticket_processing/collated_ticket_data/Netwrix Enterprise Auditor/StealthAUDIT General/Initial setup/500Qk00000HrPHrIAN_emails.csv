Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we reviewed StealthAUDIT, and this covered the SEEK System Scan erring out because Sensitive Data was not installed.
We downloaded and installed the Sensitive data. You will run the SEK System Scan and the Bulk Import before you run the DLP.
You can reply to this email to provide an update.

Hello Latonya,

I wanted to follow up after our recent online meeting to see how things are going. I haven’t heard from you since our last discussion and wanted to check if you were able to make progress on the items we talked about or if you still need assistance.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further support—I’m here to help!

Looking forward to your response.

Ticket Number: 00425917
Ticket Subject: Locating PII Using DLP scans
Ticket Details: Hello,

Previously, just based on old reports, it looks like we were able to find some PII using the DLP scans in StealthAUDIT. As of now, though, when we run them, it is returning no data even though we know there are files on the servers that have PII. We haven't been able to figure out why it's not returning any data and would like some assistance, thanks!

Thank you!

Frantz Baptiste
Technical Support Engineer
