We identified that the sample file gathered was at least 5 levels deep but the configuration of the FSAA system scan was only scanning 3 levels deep. We also suggested a more optimized way of scanning deeper without hyper-extending the system scan times by utilizing the different FSAA scoping options.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-07-03T16:24:55.000Z","2024-07-03T16:25:13.000Z","false","false"
