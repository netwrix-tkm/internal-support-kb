"00aQk000008ER29IAG","500Qk00000D8nyXIAR","Met with customer on 7/26 and 7/30 to assist with tempdb issues. Modified Schedules and disabled the Exchange solution set. Modified SharePoint group for 5 level depth with differential enabled post SP Data Drop job run. Detailed notes on the TempDB modifications can be seen in the attached word doc. From a support perspective, this should be good to close. 

Mark Richmond and James Freeman will continue communication on their end since this derives from a POC for Exchange and SharePoint.","0054u000006goKcAAI","2024-07-30T14:19:51.000Z","2024-07-30T14:19:51.000Z","false","false"
