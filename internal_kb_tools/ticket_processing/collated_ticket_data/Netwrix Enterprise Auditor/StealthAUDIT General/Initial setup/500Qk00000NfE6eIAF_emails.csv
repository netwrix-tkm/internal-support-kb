Hello Mike,

I wanted to follow up after our recent online meeting to see how things are going. I haven’t heard from you since our last discussion and wanted to check if you were able to make progress on the items we talked about or if you still need assistance.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further support—I’m here to help!

Looking forward to your response.

Ticket Number: 00440919
Ticket Subject: FSAA job errors after 0 seconds
Ticket Details: FSAA job errors after 0 seconds

Lots of errors about permissions not found etc but I ran it manually a couple weeks ago and it seemed to run fine. Just not running when it is scheduled to run and it prevents all the following jobs from executing.

Thank you!

Frantz Baptiste
Technical Support Engineer
