"500Qk00000GBD8oIAH","00421923","Support Ticket","Purge older detections to get Disk space back on SQL Server","HI, we have an issue with our sql server keep filling up.  The data is collected for the stealtaudit (11.5) onto there.  We have a script created that purged the data for the NVmonitorData down to 7 months, but the Stealthaudit DB just keeps growing.  Is there a setting anywhere I can change, to cut the amount kept for the Stealthaudit down, so we can keep some space on the disk for the SQL server?

Apologies if this is not clear, I can explain more with screenshots if needs be?

kind regards
