"500Qk00000ICPpvIAH","00426778","Support Ticket","Temporary datbase size","There is a drive on the server hosting the database that is 461gb for the temp files created I believe while jobs are running. This drive at times will fill up. Is this expected that temp files would take up a lot of space? From what I'm told the temp files it's writing are as big as the database itself. Just want to make sure there isn't something going on here or if we need to look at expanding that drive. Thanks","","Customer is asking about the size of the tempDB for NEA. I provided documentation to help him size it, but the size of his current tempDB that he is worrying about doesn't seem very large.
