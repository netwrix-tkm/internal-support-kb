we require assistance sorting Enterprise auditor database, where its it utilizing 90% of memory.","","---------------

Customer reported that recently RAM utilization on SQL server for Netwrix Access Analyzer was increased. 

I asked customer to provide more details and here is their reply:
     1. You are currently experiencing 90% RAM utilization on the SQL server for for Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor). Is that correct? Yes
    2. Do you have a dedicated/separate SQL server for Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) database? Or application and SQL server are located on the same machine? Separate database server
    3. How much RAM and CPU resources does your SQL server have? 8 cores and 36GB RAM
    4. Why 90% RAM usage on SQL server is unexpected to you? Was RAM usage lower previously? yes
    5. If the RAM usage was different before - what has changed in the Netwrix Access Analyzer (Enterprise Auditor) application? Did you configure a new job/solution recently? No but recently lots of jobs were enabled where it was disabled previously

Asking customer which jobs were enabled recently and which jobs exactly are running right now. 

Also, customer did not provide NAA build number. 
Need to ask them one more time to run this: 
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue","Customer will reply with information about which jobs were recently enabled in NAA. These extra jobs is what increased RAM usage.","Today we saw that SQL server RAM utilization was at 94%.

I then checked Enterprise Auditor for any running jobs or tasks - but there were no instances of running jobs in Enterprise Auditor console. 
Also, the Enterprise Auditor logs were investigated and they did not indicate any actively running tasks.
We also checked if there are any active connections to SQL server by opening SSMS and running this query:

SELECT
    session_id,
    login_name,
    host_name,
    program_name,
    login_time,
    status
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions

Result showed us that the only active connection was the one we created using SQL Server Management Studio.

Since Netwrix Enterprise Auditor was not actively running any tasks - it was suggested to ask for assistance from database administrator from your team.
As we discussed with database administrator  - it is expected from Microsoft SQL Server to keep allocated memory even if the task that required this RAM is not running anymore. This is because Microsoft SQL server uses allocated RAM as a buffer to improve server performance.

As such, database administrator suggested adding a cap for SQL server to keep RAM utilization under 90%.
A cap for 30 GB of RAM was added by changing this setting using SSMS: Database Instance > Properties > Memory > Server memory options settings.","Backend Server Fix","Artem Naskal","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.6","","12.1","Closed - Resolved","Qatar Energy","Ohoud AlKaabi","2025-04-16T07:09:40.000Z","2025-04-28T08:52:52.000Z"
