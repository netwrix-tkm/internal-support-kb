Adam,

Could you please clarify if you are planning to host Enterprise Auditor on an OS that is different from Windows Server?

As per our requirements, only Windows Server OS is supported:
 
Enterprise Auditor Console & Access Information Center Server Requirements

The server can be physical or virtual. The requirements are:


	
	Windows Server 2012 through Windows Server 2022
	


Additionally the server must meet these requirements:


	
	US English language installation
	
	
	Domain member
	
	 
	


Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Hi, we planning to move to a new Netapp machine A70.

The OS is going to be CDOT 9.15.1

Is there a special preparation that we need to do or other consideration?

 

Our current ""Enterprise Auditor"" version is 11.6.0.62
