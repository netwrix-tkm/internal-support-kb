Hi Scottie,

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red – I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run
[cid:image004.png@01DB9E77.E68BF3B0]

The new servers I would expect to see are
SHRPRDWAV007
SHRPRDWAV008
SHRPRDWAV009
SHRPRDWAV010

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

Thanks,
Gary

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host. 

Our next steps are:

Further investigate the file structure in the AIC and FSAA system scan against the desired hosts.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hi Scottie,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red – I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run



 

The new servers I would expect to see are

SHRPRDWAV007

SHRPRDWAV008

SHRPRDWAV009

SHRPRDWAV010

 

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. 

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:  

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Users unable to request access to shares published in AIC; Share Owners unable to respond to access requests or administer access to the file shares.  Currently there are resource audits going on within the AIC, I do not know what affect this has on those yet, I will be finding out and can let you know/.
Who is affected by this issue? Anyone requesting access to published shares in the AIC, Share owners
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? We have been working through the DFS share configuration to try and run scans to recognize DFS resources.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? While working the issue we are wondering if there is any way of rapidly changing current server names to new server names on any impacted resources.
Is this a new configuration, data collection or report? No, we have been using the AIC for many years -
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? 3 servers that hosted shares have been replaced.
When did this issue start?  We found out today.
What are the steps to reproduce? Request a resource in the AIC.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue



Please perform the follow steps and upload the resulting Artifacts:

Enable Debug Logging
From the NEA Console > Settings > Application
Set Log Level to Debug
Rerun jobs that are failing to collect logs in full detail. Return Log level to warning afterwards.


Please provide logs from the following locations: 
Enterprise Auditor Console: %SAInstallDir%SADatabaseLogsApplication 
Access Information Center (11.6): C:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsAccess Information Center 
Access Information (11.5): C:inetpubwwwrootStealthAUDIT Compliance 

Export of Job(s) – note jobs may be nested under multiple Groups:
Right click on the Job or Job Group experiencing problems and select Export. This creates .zip file containing all logs and configuration settings of your jobs that we can import and review.


From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred: 
 

Thank you,

Hi Tay,

Good news – it worked!  We are seeing the folders we expected to in the DFS path (never a doubt 😊 ).

Please let us know if it is at all possible to update paths via the database (swapping physical path with the DFS path) for the Resources in AIC/Audit.  I know it’s a long shot, but worth asking.

Thank you,
Rick

Hi Tay – we do have an issue with the DFS.

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

Here’s the resource that I want to add via DFS path
[cid:image001.png@01DBA21F.2957FE00]

It won’t open the folder via DFS
[cid:image002.png@01DBA21F.2957FE00]

But let’s me take the top folder

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Users unable to request access to shares published in AIC; Share Owners unable to respond to access requests or administer access to the file shares.  Currently there are resource audits going on within the AIC, I do not know what affect this has on those yet, I will be finding out and can let you know/.
Who is affected by this issue? Anyone requesting access to published shares in the AIC, Share owners
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? We have been working through the DFS share configuration to try and run scans to recognize DFS resources.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? While working the issue we are wondering if there is any way of rapidly changing current server names to new server names on any impacted resources.
Is this a new configuration, data collection or report? No, we have been using the AIC for many years -
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? 3 servers that hosted shares have been replaced.
When did this issue start?  We found out today.
What are the steps to reproduce? Request a resource in the AIC.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
[cid:image005.png@01DBA21F.2957FE00]

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. Are you experiencing an error when you attempt to add the resource?

Just for clarification, is it the REP_SPTest appended path that isn't being added or is it the rocshr50 path that isn't being added? 

If so, has NEA successfully completed its FSDFS system scan and Bulk Import and are those paths quarriable in the SQL database? 

Thank you,

Hi Tay – we do have an issue with the DFS.

 

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

 

Here’s the resource that I want to add via DFS path



 

It won’t open the folder via DFS



 

But let’s me take the top folder



 

Thanks,
Rick

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed a duplicate entry of \W2RSHR02.excellus.comData that did not have any links attached via the HostID
	Reran the FSDFS_SystemScan job
	Enabled the Resolve Links analysis tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import


Let me know how the AIC looks for the DFS stuff once that FS Job group completes!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Gary,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host. 

Our next steps are:

Further investigate the file structure in the AIC and FSAA system scan against the desired hosts.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hi Scottie,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red – I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run



 

The new servers I would expect to see are

SHRPRDWAV007

SHRPRDWAV008

SHRPRDWAV009

SHRPRDWAV010

 

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hi Scotty,

It is the REP_SPTest appended path that is not adding when we attempt to add \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest>
But the physical path shows as available to add: \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest<file://shrprdwav007/share-vold$/REP_SPTest>
The physical path is what I am looking to avoid in favor of the DFS path

The FSDS and FSAA Bulk imports have run since Tay helped us make the adjustments to get the FSDS job working.

I will have to defer to Gary regarding the SQL database queries.

Thanks,
Rick

Thank you for the updated information. Technically, the Namespace would be created on the DFS server or replication enabled pointing to the DFS server and NEA is only using the FSDFS system scan to scan the target servers Namespace. I would recommend verifying if NEA is pulling that path from the DFS server by reviewing the results node from the most recent scan or running a target query against the FSDFS_Links table for that resource path. The AIC can't add resources but it can add a resource owner to an already indexed resource path from the DFS server. 

Thank you,

Hi Scotty,

 

It is the REP_SPTest appended path that is not adding when we attempt to add \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest

But the physical path shows as available to add: \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest

The physical path is what I am looking to avoid in favor of the DFS path

 

The FSDS and FSAA Bulk imports have run since Tay helped us make the adjustments to get the FSDS job working.

 

I will have to defer to Gary regarding the SQL database queries.

 

Thanks,
Rick

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. Are you experiencing an error when you attempt to add the resource?

Just for clarification, is it the REP_SPTest appended path that isn't being added or is it the rocshr50 path that isn't being added? 

If so, has NEA successfully completed its FSDFS system scan and Bulk Import and are those paths quarriable in the SQL database? 

Thank you,

Hi Tay – we do have an issue with the DFS.

 

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

 

Here’s the resource that I want to add via DFS path



 

It won’t open the folder via DFS



 

But let’s me take the top folder



 

Thanks,
Rick

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed a duplicate entry of \W2RSHR02.excellus.comData that did not have any links attached via the HostID
	Reran the FSDFS_SystemScan job
	Enabled the Resolve Links analysis tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import


Let me know how the AIC looks for the DFS stuff once that FS Job group completes!

Thank you,

Hello Gary,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host. 

Our next steps are:

Further investigate the file structure in the AIC and FSAA system scan against the desired hosts.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hi Scottie,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red – I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run



 

The new servers I would expect to see are

SHRPRDWAV007

SHRPRDWAV008

SHRPRDWAV009

SHRPRDWAV010

 

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. 

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:  

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Users unable to request access to shares published in AIC; Share Owners unable to respond to access requests or administer access to the file shares.  Currently there are resource audits going on within the AIC, I do not know what affect this has on those yet, I will be finding out and can let you know/.
Who is affected by this issue? Anyone requesting access to published shares in the AIC, Share owners
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? We have been working through the DFS share configuration to try and run scans to recognize DFS resources.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? While working the issue we are wondering if there is any way of rapidly changing current server names to new server names on any impacted resources.
Is this a new configuration, data collection or report? No, we have been using the AIC for many years -
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? 3 servers that hosted shares have been replaced.
When did this issue start?  We found out today.
What are the steps to reproduce? Request a resource in the AIC.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue



Please perform the follow steps and upload the resulting Artifacts:

Enable Debug Logging
From the NEA Console > Settings > Application
Set Log Level to Debug
Rerun jobs that are failing to collect logs in full detail. Return Log level to warning afterwards.


Please provide logs from the following locations: 
Enterprise Auditor Console: %SAInstallDir%SADatabaseLogsApplication 
Access Information Center (11.6): C:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsAccess Information Center 
Access Information (11.5): C:inetpubwwwrootStealthAUDIT Compliance 

Export of Job(s) – note jobs may be nested under multiple Groups:
Right click on the Job or Job Group experiencing problems and select Export. This creates .zip file containing all logs and configuration settings of your jobs that we can import and review.


From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred:

Hi Scottie,

I’m not sure we can query the data please see below:

This is STBPRDWAV003 – our Audit server that we believe DFS is function properly, DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID are populated.

[cid:image009.png@01DBA24C.595AF8F0]

This is STBPRDWAV002 – the problem AIC server, notice it does not have DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID.  Despite the DB having data when I select the Link NameSpace results it just spins and I have to kill the console ( See screen shot below this one).

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Users unable to request access to shares published in AIC; Share Owners unable to respond to access requests or administer access to the file shares.  Currently there are resource audits going on within the AIC, I do not know what affect this has on those yet, I will be finding out and can let you know/.
Who is affected by this issue? Anyone requesting access to published shares in the AIC, Share owners
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? We have been working through the DFS share configuration to try and run scans to recognize DFS resources.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? While working the issue we are wondering if there is any way of rapidly changing current server names to new server names on any impacted resources.
Is this a new configuration, data collection or report? No, we have been using the AIC for many years -
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? 3 servers that hosted shares have been replaced.
When did this issue start?  We found out today.
What are the steps to reproduce? Request a resource in the AIC.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
[cid:image015.png@01DBA24C.595AF8F0]

Thank you for the updated information. The Namespace Path (W2RSHR02.excellus.com) is the duplicate that was removed previous. That may be the cause to the Null values. We would need to run a query search on that table against the \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest resource path to verify that NEA is collecting that namespace. If its not collecting it and indexing into the SQL database you won't be able to run a search in the AIC for it. 

Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

 

I’m not sure we can query the data please see below:

 

This is STBPRDWAV003 – our Audit server that we believe DFS is function properly, DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID are populated.

 



 

This is STBPRDWAV002 – the problem AIC server, notice it does not have DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID.  Despite the DB having data when I select the Link NameSpace results it just spins and I have to kill the console ( See screen shot below this one).

Hi Scotty,

 

It is the REP_SPTest appended path that is not adding when we attempt to add \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest

But the physical path shows as available to add: \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest

The physical path is what I am looking to avoid in favor of the DFS path

 

The FSDS and FSAA Bulk imports have run since Tay helped us make the adjustments to get the FSDS job working.

 

I will have to defer to Gary regarding the SQL database queries.

 

Thanks,
Rick

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. Are you experiencing an error when you attempt to add the resource?

Just for clarification, is it the REP_SPTest appended path that isn't being added or is it the rocshr50 path that isn't being added? 

If so, has NEA successfully completed its FSDFS system scan and Bulk Import and are those paths quarriable in the SQL database? 

Thank you,

Hi Tay – we do have an issue with the DFS.

 

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

 

Here’s the resource that I want to add via DFS path



 

It won’t open the folder via DFS



 

But let’s me take the top folder



 

Thanks,
Rick

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed a duplicate entry of \W2RSHR02.excellus.comData that did not have any links attached via the HostID
	Reran the FSDFS_SystemScan job
	Enabled the Resolve Links analysis tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import


Let me know how the AIC looks for the DFS stuff once that FS Job group completes!

Thank you,

Hello Gary,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host. 

Our next steps are:

Further investigate the file structure in the AIC and FSAA system scan against the desired hosts.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hi Scottie,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red – I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run



 

The new servers I would expect to see are

SHRPRDWAV007

SHRPRDWAV008

SHRPRDWAV009

SHRPRDWAV010

 

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hi Scottie/Tay,

After last nights scan it looks like it populated the DFS info we showed missing yesterday.
[cid:image001.png@01DBA2E7.2CB55CF0]

To answer your question Scottie – No, I am not able to query  \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest> in this table.  If you notice the highlighted line it only goes to  \w2rshr02DataShare<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/>.  Since that is the last shared folder before it breaks out to the individual folders we have published in the AIC.  We would think we could path down to those folders in the AIC as we did before.  Are we still missing something?  Should we be able to use the DFS path when publishing these folders in the AIC?  Can we set something up to walk through this?

Thanks,
Gary

Hello Gary,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host.

Our next steps are:

Further investigate the file structure in the AIC and FSAA system scan against the desired hosts.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hi Scottie,

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red – I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run
[cid:image008.png@01DBA2E7.2CB55CF0]

The new servers I would expect to see are
SHRPRDWAV007
SHRPRDWAV008
SHRPRDWAV009
SHRPRDWAV010

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

Thanks,
Gary

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Users unable to request access to shares published in AIC; Share Owners unable to respond to access requests or administer access to the file shares.  Currently there are resource audits going on within the AIC, I do not know what affect this has on those yet, I will be finding out and can let you know/.
Who is affected by this issue? Anyone requesting access to published shares in the AIC, Share owners
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? We have been working through the DFS share configuration to try and run scans to recognize DFS resources.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? While working the issue we are wondering if there is any way of rapidly changing current server names to new server names on any impacted resources.
Is this a new configuration, data collection or report? No, we have been using the AIC for many years -
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? 3 servers that hosted shares have been replaced.
When did this issue start?  We found out today.
What are the steps to reproduce? Request a resource in the AIC.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
[cid:image009.png@01DBA2E7.2CB55CF0]

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. If you're not seeing the path in the database then its not going to be displayed in the AIC as that's the reference the AIC uses to build its file structure. I would verify that the namespace is available on the DFS server. Then you'd need to get a successful FSDFS system scan, FSAA system scan and a FSAA Bulk Import before it will display in the AIC. I have tested this method in my lab and have gotten a few successful scans. I have provided screenshots below:

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NN0Rt:ref



Hi Scottie/Tay,

 

After last nights scan it looks like it populated the DFS info we showed missing yesterday. 



 

To answer your question Scottie – No, I am not able to query  \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest in this table.  If you notice the highlighted line it only goes to  \w2rshr02DataShare.  Since that is the last shared folder before it breaks out to the individual folders we have published in the AIC.  We would think we could path down to those folders in the AIC as we did before.  Are we still missing something?  Should we be able to use the DFS path when publishing these folders in the AIC?  Can we set something up to walk through this?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. The Namespace Path (W2RSHR02.excellus.com) is the duplicate that was removed previous. That may be the cause to the Null values. We would need to run a query search on that table against the \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest resource path to verify that NEA is collecting that namespace. If its not collecting it and indexing into the SQL database you won't be able to run a search in the AIC for it. 

Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

 

I’m not sure we can query the data please see below:

 

This is STBPRDWAV003 – our Audit server that we believe DFS is function properly, DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID are populated.

 



 

This is STBPRDWAV002 – the problem AIC server, notice it does not have DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID.  Despite the DB having data when I select the Link NameSpace results it just spins and I have to kill the console ( See screen shot below this one).

Hi Scotty,

 

It is the REP_SPTest appended path that is not adding when we attempt to add \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest

But the physical path shows as available to add: \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest

The physical path is what I am looking to avoid in favor of the DFS path

 

The FSDS and FSAA Bulk imports have run since Tay helped us make the adjustments to get the FSDS job working.

 

I will have to defer to Gary regarding the SQL database queries.

 

Thanks,
Rick

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. Are you experiencing an error when you attempt to add the resource?

Just for clarification, is it the REP_SPTest appended path that isn't being added or is it the rocshr50 path that isn't being added? 

If so, has NEA successfully completed its FSDFS system scan and Bulk Import and are those paths quarriable in the SQL database? 

Thank you,

Hi Tay – we do have an issue with the DFS.

 

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

 

Here’s the resource that I want to add via DFS path



 

It won’t open the folder via DFS



 

But let’s me take the top folder



 

Thanks,
Rick

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed a duplicate entry of \W2RSHR02.excellus.comData that did not have any links attached via the HostID
	Reran the FSDFS_SystemScan job
	Enabled the Resolve Links analysis tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import


Let me know how the AIC looks for the DFS stuff once that FS Job group completes!

Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

So to use DFS in the AIC all of the folders we currently have published will need to be shared out and defined in the DFS namespace?
Below is our name space today, but almost everything we have published in the AIC is a subfolder under those directories that are defined in the DFS.
[cid:image001.png@01DBA3B7.FF996FF0] [cid:image002.png@01DBA3B9.C446E7A0]

So for example, Rick has a folder published in the AIC \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest<file://shrprdwav007/share-vold$/REP_SPTest>.   The DFS target would be \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest>

If I search using the UNC I can see it (the same result happens when we try to publish a folder)
[cid:image004.png@01DBA3BA.53201E60]

If I search using DFS I don't (the same result when we try to publish a folder)
[cid:image003.png@01DBA3BA.BD0445E0]

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. If you're not seeing the path in the database then its not going to be displayed in the AIC as that's the reference the AIC uses to build its file structure. I would verify that the namespace is available on the DFS server. Then you'd need to get a successful FSDFS system scan, FSAA system scan and a FSAA Bulk Import before it will display in the AIC. I have tested this method in my lab and have gotten a few successful scans. I have provided screenshots below:



Thank you,

Hi Scottie/Tay,

After last nights scan it looks like it populated the DFS info we showed missing yesterday.
To answer your question Scottie - No, I am not able to query  \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest> in this table.  If you notice the highlighted line it only goes to  \w2rshr02DataShare<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/>.  Since that is the last shared folder before it breaks out to the individual folders we have published in the AIC.  We would think we could path down to those folders in the AIC as we did before.  Are we still missing something?  Should we be able to use the DFS path when publishing these folders in the AIC?  Can we set something up to walk through this?

Thanks,
Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. The Namespace Path (W2RSHR02.excellus.com) is the duplicate that was removed previous. That may be the cause to the Null values. We would need to run a query search on that table against the \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest> resource path to verify that NEA is collecting that namespace. If its not collecting it and indexing into the SQL database you won't be able to run a search in the AIC for it.

Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

I'm not sure we can query the data please see below:

This is STBPRDWAV003 - our Audit server that we believe DFS is function properly, DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID are populated.


This is STBPRDWAV002 - the problem AIC server, notice it does not have DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID.  Despite the DB having data when I select the Link NameSpace results it just spins and I have to kill the console ( See screen shot below this one).

Hi Scotty,

It is the REP_SPTest appended path that is not adding when we attempt to add \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest>
But the physical path shows as available to add: \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest<file://shrprdwav007/share-vold$/REP_SPTest>
The physical path is what I am looking to avoid in favor of the DFS path

The FSDS and FSAA Bulk imports have run since Tay helped us make the adjustments to get the FSDS job working.

I will have to defer to Gary regarding the SQL database queries.

Thanks,
Rick

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. Are you experiencing an error when you attempt to add the resource?

Just for clarification, is it the REP_SPTest appended path that isn't being added or is it the rocshr50 path that isn't being added?

If so, has NEA successfully completed its FSDFS system scan and Bulk Import and are those paths quarriable in the SQL database?

Thank you,

Hi Tay - we do have an issue with the DFS.

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

Here's the resource that I want to add via DFS path


It won't open the folder via DFS


But let's me take the top folder


Thanks,
Rick

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, we:

  1.  Removed a duplicate entry of \W2RSHR02.excellus.comData<file://W2RSHR02.excellus.com/Data> that did not have any links attached via the HostID
  2.  Reran the FSDFS_SystemScan job
  3.  Enabled the Resolve Links analysis tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import
Let me know how the AIC looks for the DFS stuff once that FS Job group completes!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Gary,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host.

Our next steps are:

Further investigate the file structure in the AIC and FSAA system scan against the desired hosts.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hi Scottie,

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red - I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run


The new servers I would expect to see are
SHRPRDWAV007
SHRPRDWAV008
SHRPRDWAV009
SHRPRDWAV010

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

Thanks,
Gary

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Users unable to request access to shares published in AIC; Share Owners unable to respond to access requests or administer access to the file shares.  Currently there are resource audits going on within the AIC, I do not know what affect this has on those yet, I will be finding out and can let you know/.
Who is affected by this issue? Anyone requesting access to published shares in the AIC, Share owners
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? We have been working through the DFS share configuration to try and run scans to recognize DFS resources.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? While working the issue we are wondering if there is any way of rapidly changing current server names to new server names on any impacted resources.
Is this a new configuration, data collection or report? No, we have been using the AIC for many years -
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? 3 servers that hosted shares have been replaced.
When did this issue start?  We found out today.
What are the steps to reproduce? Request a resource in the AIC.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue


Please perform the follow steps and upload the resulting Artifacts:

Enable Debug Logging
From the NEA Console > Settings > Application
Set Log Level to Debug
Rerun jobs that are failing to collect logs in full detail. Return Log level to warning afterwards.


Please provide logs from the following locations:
Enterprise Auditor Console: %SAInstallDir%SADatabaseLogsApplication
Access Information Center (11.6): C:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsAccess Information Center
Access Information (11.5): C:inetpubwwwrootStealthAUDIT Compliance

Export of Job(s) - note jobs may be nested under multiple Groups:
Right click on the Job or Job Group experiencing problems and select Export. This creates .zip file containing all logs and configuration settings of your jobs that we can import and review.


From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred:

Yes, from my tests the paths should be shared within the namespace. Then running the FSDFS system scan against the DFS server and the FSAA system scan successfully completing with the possible inclusion of a higher file depth scan depending on how many levels deep the path goes, with the addition of a successful FSAA Bulk Import will display the DFS file path structure within the AIC console. In my test environment I am able to UNC to my network share as well as running a search against that network share in the AIC. Once I made that path sharable on my DFS server and ran the necessary scans it built a file structure within the AIC which is the screenshot. I have also nested folders into my DFS Namespace Server and those folders are accessible within the AIC now as well.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NN0Rt:ref



Hi Scottie,

 

So to use DFS in the AIC all of the folders we currently have published will need to be shared out and defined in the DFS namespace? 

Below is our name space today, but almost everything we have published in the AIC is a subfolder under those directories that are defined in the DFS.

 

 

So for example, Rick has a folder published in the AIC  \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest.   The DFS target would be  \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest

 

If I search using the UNC I can see it (the same result happens when we try to publish a folder)



 

If I search using DFS I don’t (the same result when we try to publish a folder)



Thanks,

Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. Are you experiencing an error when you attempt to add the resource?

Just for clarification, is it the REP_SPTest appended path that isn't being added or is it the rocshr50 path that isn't being added? 

If so, has NEA successfully completed its FSDFS system scan and Bulk Import and are those paths quarriable in the SQL database? 

Thank you,

Hi Tay – we do have an issue with the DFS.

 

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

 

Here’s the resource that I want to add via DFS path

 

 

It won’t open the folder via DFS

 

 

But let’s me take the top folder

 

 

Thanks,
Rick

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed a duplicate entry of \W2RSHR02.excellus.comData that did not have any links attached via the HostID
	Reran the FSDFS_SystemScan job
	Enabled the Resolve Links analysis tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import


Let me know how the AIC looks for the DFS stuff once that FS Job group completes!

Thank you,

Hello Gary,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host. 

Our next steps are:

Further investigate the file structure in the AIC and FSAA system scan against the desired hosts.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hi Scottie,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red – I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run

 

 

The new servers I would expect to see are

SHRPRDWAV007

SHRPRDWAV008

SHRPRDWAV009

SHRPRDWAV010

 

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. 

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:  

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Users unable to request access to shares published in AIC; Share Owners unable to respond to access requests or administer access to the file shares.  Currently there are resource audits going on within the AIC, I do not know what affect this has on those yet, I will be finding out and can let you know/.
Who is affected by this issue? Anyone requesting access to published shares in the AIC, Share owners
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? We have been working through the DFS share configuration to try and run scans to recognize DFS resources.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? While working the issue we are wondering if there is any way of rapidly changing current server names to new server names on any impacted resources.
Is this a new configuration, data collection or report? No, we have been using the AIC for many years -
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? 3 servers that hosted shares have been replaced.
When did this issue start?  We found out today.
What are the steps to reproduce? Request a resource in the AIC.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
 


Please perform the follow steps and upload the resulting Artifacts:

Enable Debug Logging
From the NEA Console > Settings > Application

Hi Scottie,

Ugh - ok, so is there a way for us to just change the server name in in the column Resource Name without changing anything else or forcing the users to re-confirm ownership?
If we have to re-import all these folders the import process forces us to go back in and have user reconfirm ownership and we have to enable requesting and owner updates along with re-adding the groups.

Hello Gary,

Yes, from my tests the paths should be shared within the namespace. Then running the FSDFS system scan against the DFS server and the FSAA system scan successfully completing with the possible inclusion of a higher file depth scan depending on how many levels deep the path goes, with the addition of a successful FSAA Bulk Import will display the DFS file path structure within the AIC console. In my test environment I am able to UNC to my network share as well as running a search against that network share in the AIC. Once I made that path sharable on my DFS server and ran the necessary scans it built a file structure within the AIC which is the screenshot. I have also nested folders into my DFS Namespace Server and those folders are accessible within the AIC now as well.

[DFS Scans 4]
[DFS Scans 6]
[DFS Scans 5]

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NN0Rt:ref


Hi Scottie,

So to use DFS in the AIC all of the folders we currently have published will need to be shared out and defined in the DFS namespace?
Below is our name space today, but almost everything we have published in the AIC is a subfolder under those directories that are defined in the DFS.
[cid:image005.png@01DBA3E5.8E759370][cid:image006.png@01DBA3E5.8E759370]

So for example, Rick has a folder published in the AIC \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest<file://shrprdwav007/share-vold$/REP_SPTest>.   The DFS target would be \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest>

If I search using the UNC I can see it (the same result happens when we try to publish a folder)
[cid:image007.png@01DBA3E5.8E759370]

If I search using DFS I don't (the same result when we try to publish a folder)
[cid:image008.png@01DBA3E5.8E759370]
Thanks,
Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. If you're not seeing the path in the database then its not going to be displayed in the AIC as that's the reference the AIC uses to build its file structure. I would verify that the namespace is available on the DFS server. Then you'd need to get a successful FSDFS system scan, FSAA system scan and a FSAA Bulk Import before it will display in the AIC. I have tested this method in my lab and have gotten a few successful scans. I have provided screenshots below:

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NN0Rt:ref


Hi Scottie/Tay,

After last nights scan it looks like it populated the DFS info we showed missing yesterday.
To answer your question Scottie - No, I am not able to query  \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest> in this table.  If you notice the highlighted line it only goes to  \w2rshr02DataShare<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/>.  Since that is the last shared folder before it breaks out to the individual folders we have published in the AIC.  We would think we could path down to those folders in the AIC as we did before.  Are we still missing something?  Should we be able to use the DFS path when publishing these folders in the AIC?  Can we set something up to walk through this?

Thanks,
Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. The Namespace Path (W2RSHR02.excellus.com) is the duplicate that was removed previous. That may be the cause to the Null values. We would need to run a query search on that table against the \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest> resource path to verify that NEA is collecting that namespace. If its not collecting it and indexing into the SQL database you won't be able to run a search in the AIC for it.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Scottie,

I'm not sure we can query the data please see below:

This is STBPRDWAV003 - our Audit server that we believe DFS is function properly, DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID are populated.


This is STBPRDWAV002 - the problem AIC server, notice it does not have DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID.  Despite the DB having data when I select the Link NameSpace results it just spins and I have to kill the console ( See screen shot below this one).

Hi Scotty,

It is the REP_SPTest appended path that is not adding when we attempt to add \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest>
But the physical path shows as available to add: \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest<file://shrprdwav007/share-vold$/REP_SPTest>
The physical path is what I am looking to avoid in favor of the DFS path

The FSDS and FSAA Bulk imports have run since Tay helped us make the adjustments to get the FSDS job working.

I will have to defer to Gary regarding the SQL database queries.

Thanks,
Rick

Hi Tay - we do have an issue with the DFS.

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

Here's the resource that I want to add via DFS path


It won't open the folder via DFS


But let's me take the top folder

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, we:

  1.  Removed a duplicate entry of \W2RSHR02.excellus.comData<file://W2RSHR02.excellus.com/Data> that did not have any links attached via the HostID
  2.  Reran the FSDFS_SystemScan job
  3.  Enabled the Resolve Links analysis tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import
Let me know how the AIC looks for the DFS stuff once that FS Job group completes!

Thank you,

Hello Gary,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host.

Our next steps are:

Further investigate the file structure in the AIC and FSAA system scan against the desired hosts.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hi Scottie,

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red - I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run


The new servers I would expect to see are
SHRPRDWAV007
SHRPRDWAV008
SHRPRDWAV009
SHRPRDWAV010

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

Thanks,
Gary

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Users unable to request access to shares published in AIC; Share Owners unable to respond to access requests or administer access to the file shares.  Currently there are resource audits going on within the AIC, I do not know what affect this has on those yet, I will be finding out and can let you know/.
Who is affected by this issue? Anyone requesting access to published shares in the AIC, Share owners
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? We have been working through the DFS share configuration to try and run scans to recognize DFS resources.

Hi Scottie,

 

Ugh – ok, so is there a way for us to just change the server name in in the column Resource Name without changing anything else or forcing the users to re-confirm ownership?

If we have to re-import all these folders the import process forces us to go back in and have user reconfirm ownership and we have to enable requesting and owner updates along with re-adding the groups.  



 

Thanks,

Gary

Hello Gary,

Yes, from my tests the paths should be shared within the namespace. Then running the FSDFS system scan against the DFS server and the FSAA system scan successfully completing with the possible inclusion of a higher file depth scan depending on how many levels deep the path goes, with the addition of a successful FSAA Bulk Import will display the DFS file path structure within the AIC console. In my test environment I am able to UNC to my network share as well as running a search against that network share in the AIC. Once I made that path sharable on my DFS server and ran the necessary scans it built a file structure within the AIC which is the screenshot. I have also nested folders into my DFS Namespace Server and those folders are accessible within the AIC now as well. 





Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

 

So to use DFS in the AIC all of the folders we currently have published will need to be shared out and defined in the DFS namespace? 

Below is our name space today, but almost everything we have published in the AIC is a subfolder under those directories that are defined in the DFS.



 

So for example, Rick has a folder published in the AIC \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest.   The DFS target would be \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest

 

If I search using the UNC I can see it (the same result happens when we try to publish a folder)



 

If I search using DFS I don’t (the same result when we try to publish a folder)



Thanks,

Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. If you're not seeing the path in the database then its not going to be displayed in the AIC as that's the reference the AIC uses to build its file structure. I would verify that the namespace is available on the DFS server. Then you'd need to get a successful FSDFS system scan, FSAA system scan and a FSAA Bulk Import before it will display in the AIC. I have tested this method in my lab and have gotten a few successful scans. I have provided screenshots below:

Hi Scottie/Tay,

 

After last nights scan it looks like it populated the DFS info we showed missing yesterday. 

To answer your question Scottie – No, I am not able to query  \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest in this table.  If you notice the highlighted line it only goes to  \w2rshr02DataShare.  Since that is the last shared folder before it breaks out to the individual folders we have published in the AIC.  We would think we could path down to those folders in the AIC as we did before.  Are we still missing something?  Should we be able to use the DFS path when publishing these folders in the AIC?  Can we set something up to walk through this?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. The Namespace Path (W2RSHR02.excellus.com) is the duplicate that was removed previous. That may be the cause to the Null values. We would need to run a query search on that table against the \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest resource path to verify that NEA is collecting that namespace. If its not collecting it and indexing into the SQL database you won't be able to run a search in the AIC for it. 

Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

 

I’m not sure we can query the data please see below:

 

This is STBPRDWAV003 – our Audit server that we believe DFS is function properly, DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID are populated.

 

 

This is STBPRDWAV002 – the problem AIC server, notice it does not have DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID.  Despite the DB having data when I select the Link NameSpace results it just spins and I have to kill the console ( See screen shot below this one).

Hi Scotty,

 

It is the REP_SPTest appended path that is not adding when we attempt to add \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest

But the physical path shows as available to add: \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest

The physical path is what I am looking to avoid in favor of the DFS path

 

The FSDS and FSAA Bulk imports have run since Tay helped us make the adjustments to get the FSDS job working.

 

I will have to defer to Gary regarding the SQL database queries.

 

Thanks,
Rick

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. Are you experiencing an error when you attempt to add the resource?

Just for clarification, is it the REP_SPTest appended path that isn't being added or is it the rocshr50 path that isn't being added? 

If so, has NEA successfully completed its FSDFS system scan and Bulk Import and are those paths quarriable in the SQL database? 

Thank you,

Hi Tay – we do have an issue with the DFS.

 

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

 

Here’s the resource that I want to add via DFS path

 

 

It won’t open the folder via DFS

 

 

But let’s me take the top folder

 

 

Thanks,
Rick

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed a duplicate entry of \W2RSHR02.excellus.comData that did not have any links attached via the HostID
	Reran the FSDFS_SystemScan job
	Enabled the Resolve Links analysis tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import


Let me know how the AIC looks for the DFS stuff once that FS Job group completes!

Thank you,

I've been able to gather more information and it seems that there is an AIC Resources table that could possibly be updated but it will require involvement from our development team. Other than that the initial option of re-importing the resource paths is the only way unfortunately.

Hi Scottie,

 

Ugh – ok, so is there a way for us to just change the server name in in the column Resource Name without changing anything else or forcing the users to re-confirm ownership?

If we have to re-import all these folders the import process forces us to go back in and have user reconfirm ownership and we have to enable requesting and owner updates along with re-adding the groups.  



 

Thanks,

Gary

Hello Gary,

Yes, from my tests the paths should be shared within the namespace. Then running the FSDFS system scan against the DFS server and the FSAA system scan successfully completing with the possible inclusion of a higher file depth scan depending on how many levels deep the path goes, with the addition of a successful FSAA Bulk Import will display the DFS file path structure within the AIC console. In my test environment I am able to UNC to my network share as well as running a search against that network share in the AIC. Once I made that path sharable on my DFS server and ran the necessary scans it built a file structure within the AIC which is the screenshot. I have also nested folders into my DFS Namespace Server and those folders are accessible within the AIC now as well. 





Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NN0Rt:ref

 


Hi Scottie,

 

So to use DFS in the AIC all of the folders we currently have published will need to be shared out and defined in the DFS namespace? 

Below is our name space today, but almost everything we have published in the AIC is a subfolder under those directories that are defined in the DFS.



 

So for example, Rick has a folder published in the AIC \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest.   The DFS target would be \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest

 

If I search using the UNC I can see it (the same result happens when we try to publish a folder)



 

If I search using DFS I don’t (the same result when we try to publish a folder)



Thanks,

Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. If you're not seeing the path in the database then its not going to be displayed in the AIC as that's the reference the AIC uses to build its file structure. I would verify that the namespace is available on the DFS server. Then you'd need to get a successful FSDFS system scan, FSAA system scan and a FSAA Bulk Import before it will display in the AIC. I have tested this method in my lab and have gotten a few successful scans. I have provided screenshots below:

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NN0Rt:ref

 


Hi Scottie/Tay,

 

After last nights scan it looks like it populated the DFS info we showed missing yesterday. 

To answer your question Scottie – No, I am not able to query  \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest in this table.  If you notice the highlighted line it only goes to  \w2rshr02DataShare.  Since that is the last shared folder before it breaks out to the individual folders we have published in the AIC.  We would think we could path down to those folders in the AIC as we did before.  Are we still missing something?  Should we be able to use the DFS path when publishing these folders in the AIC?  Can we set something up to walk through this?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. The Namespace Path (W2RSHR02.excellus.com) is the duplicate that was removed previous. That may be the cause to the Null values. We would need to run a query search on that table against the \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest resource path to verify that NEA is collecting that namespace. If its not collecting it and indexing into the SQL database you won't be able to run a search in the AIC for it. 

Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

 

I’m not sure we can query the data please see below:

 

This is STBPRDWAV003 – our Audit server that we believe DFS is function properly, DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID are populated.

 

 

This is STBPRDWAV002 – the problem AIC server, notice it does not have DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID.  Despite the DB having data when I select the Link NameSpace results it just spins and I have to kill the console ( See screen shot below this one).

Hi Scotty,

 

It is the REP_SPTest appended path that is not adding when we attempt to add \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest

But the physical path shows as available to add: \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest

The physical path is what I am looking to avoid in favor of the DFS path

 

The FSDS and FSAA Bulk imports have run since Tay helped us make the adjustments to get the FSDS job working.

 

I will have to defer to Gary regarding the SQL database queries.

 

Thanks,
Rick

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. Are you experiencing an error when you attempt to add the resource?

Just for clarification, is it the REP_SPTest appended path that isn't being added or is it the rocshr50 path that isn't being added? 

If so, has NEA successfully completed its FSDFS system scan and Bulk Import and are those paths quarriable in the SQL database? 

Thank you,

Hi Tay – we do have an issue with the DFS.

 

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

 

Here’s the resource that I want to add via DFS path

 

 

It won’t open the folder via DFS

 

 

But let’s me take the top folder

 

 

Thanks,
Rick

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed a duplicate entry of \W2RSHR02.excellus.comData that did not have any links attached via the HostID
	Reran the FSDFS_SystemScan job
	Enabled the Resolve Links analysis tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import


Let me know how the AIC looks for the DFS stuff once that FS Job group completes!

Thank you,

Hello Gary,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host. 

Our next steps are:

Further investigate the file structure in the AIC and FSAA system scan against the desired hosts.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hi Scottie,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red – I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run

 

 

The new servers I would expect to see are

SHRPRDWAV007

SHRPRDWAV008

SHRPRDWAV009

SHRPRDWAV010

 

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. 

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:  

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Users unable to request access to shares published in AIC; Share Owners unable to respond to access requests or administer access to the file shares.  Currently there are resource audits going on within the AIC, I do not know what affect this has on those yet, I will be finding out and can let you know/.
Who is affected by this issue? Anyone requesting access to published shares in the AIC, Share owners
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? We have been working through the DFS share configuration to try and run scans to recognize DFS resources.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? While working the issue we are wondering if there is any way of rapidly changing current server names to new server names on any impacted resources.
Is this a new configuration, data collection or report? No, we have been using the AIC for many years -
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? 3 servers that hosted shares have been replaced.
When did this issue start?  We found out today.
What are the steps to reproduce? Request a resource in the AIC.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

Hi Scottie,

Ugh – ok, so is there a way for us to just change the server name in in the column Resource Name without changing anything else or forcing the users to re-confirm ownership?
If we have to re-import all these folders the import process forces us to go back in and have user reconfirm ownership and we have to enable requesting and owner updates along with re-adding the groups.

Hello Gary,

Yes, from my tests the paths should be shared within the namespace. Then running the FSDFS system scan against the DFS server and the FSAA system scan successfully completing with the possible inclusion of a higher file depth scan depending on how many levels deep the path goes, with the addition of a successful FSAA Bulk Import will display the DFS file path structure within the AIC console. In my test environment I am able to UNC to my network share as well as running a search against that network share in the AIC. Once I made that path sharable on my DFS server and ran the necessary scans it built a file structure within the AIC which is the screenshot. I have also nested folders into my DFS Namespace Server and those folders are accessible within the AIC now as well.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NN0Rt:ref


Hi Scottie,

So to use DFS in the AIC all of the folders we currently have published will need to be shared out and defined in the DFS namespace?
Below is our name space today, but almost everything we have published in the AIC is a subfolder under those directories that are defined in the DFS.
[cid:image005.png@01DBA787.50712EE0][cid:image006.png@01DBA787.50712EE0]

So for example, Rick has a folder published in the AIC \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest<file://shrprdwav007/share-vold$/REP_SPTest>.   The DFS target would be \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest>

If I search using the UNC I can see it (the same result happens when we try to publish a folder)
[cid:image007.png@01DBA787.50712EE0]

If I search using DFS I don’t (the same result when we try to publish a folder)
[cid:image008.png@01DBA787.50712EE0]
Thanks,
Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. If you're not seeing the path in the database then its not going to be displayed in the AIC as that's the reference the AIC uses to build its file structure. I would verify that the namespace is available on the DFS server. Then you'd need to get a successful FSDFS system scan, FSAA system scan and a FSAA Bulk Import before it will display in the AIC. I have tested this method in my lab and have gotten a few successful scans. I have provided screenshots below:



Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NN0Rt:ref


Hi Scottie/Tay,

After last nights scan it looks like it populated the DFS info we showed missing yesterday.
To answer your question Scottie – No, I am not able to query  \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest> in this table.  If you notice the highlighted line it only goes to  \w2rshr02DataShare<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/>.  Since that is the last shared folder before it breaks out to the individual folders we have published in the AIC.  We would think we could path down to those folders in the AIC as we did before.  Are we still missing something?  Should we be able to use the DFS path when publishing these folders in the AIC?  Can we set something up to walk through this?

Thanks,
Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. The Namespace Path (W2RSHR02.excellus.com) is the duplicate that was removed previous. That may be the cause to the Null values. We would need to run a query search on that table against the \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest> resource path to verify that NEA is collecting that namespace. If its not collecting it and indexing into the SQL database you won't be able to run a search in the AIC for it.

Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

I’m not sure we can query the data please see below:

This is STBPRDWAV003 – our Audit server that we believe DFS is function properly, DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID are populated.


This is STBPRDWAV002 – the problem AIC server, notice it does not have DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID.  Despite the DB having data when I select the Link NameSpace results it just spins and I have to kill the console ( See screen shot below this one).

Hi Scotty,

It is the REP_SPTest appended path that is not adding when we attempt to add \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest<file://w2rshr02/Data/Share/REP_SPTest>
But the physical path shows as available to add: \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest<file://shrprdwav007/share-vold$/REP_SPTest>
The physical path is what I am looking to avoid in favor of the DFS path

The FSDS and FSAA Bulk imports have run since Tay helped us make the adjustments to get the FSDS job working.

I will have to defer to Gary regarding the SQL database queries.

Thanks,
Rick

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. Are you experiencing an error when you attempt to add the resource?

Just for clarification, is it the REP_SPTest appended path that isn't being added or is it the rocshr50 path that isn't being added?

If so, has NEA successfully completed its FSDFS system scan and Bulk Import and are those paths quarriable in the SQL database?

Thank you,

Hi Tay – we do have an issue with the DFS.

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

Here’s the resource that I want to add via DFS path


It won’t open the folder via DFS


But let’s me take the top folder


Thanks,
Rick

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, we:

  1.  Removed a duplicate entry of \W2RSHR02.excellus.comData<file://W2RSHR02.excellus.com/Data> that did not have any links attached via the HostID
  2.  Reran the FSDFS_SystemScan job
  3.  Enabled the Resolve Links analysis tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import
Let me know how the AIC looks for the DFS stuff once that FS Job group completes!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Gary,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host.

Our next steps are:

Further investigate the file structure in the AIC and FSAA system scan against the desired hosts.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hi Scottie,

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red – I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run


The new servers I would expect to see are
SHRPRDWAV007
SHRPRDWAV008
SHRPRDWAV009
SHRPRDWAV010

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

Thanks,
Gary

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Users unable to request access to shares published in AIC; Share Owners unable to respond to access requests or administer access to the file shares.  Currently there are resource audits going on within the AIC, I do not know what affect this has on those yet, I will be finding out and can let you know/.
Who is affected by this issue? Anyone requesting access to published shares in the AIC, Share owners
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? We have been working through the DFS share configuration to try and run scans to recognize DFS resources.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? While working the issue we are wondering if there is any way of rapidly changing current server names to new server names on any impacted resources.
Is this a new configuration, data collection or report? No, we have been using the AIC for many years -
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? 3 servers that hosted shares have been replaced.
When did this issue start?  We found out today.
What are the steps to reproduce? Request a resource in the AIC.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue


Please perform the follow steps and upload the resulting Artifacts:

Enable Debug Logging
From the NEA Console > Settings > Application
Set Log Level to Debug
Rerun jobs that are failing to collect logs in full detail. Return Log level to warning afterwards.


Please provide logs from the following locations:
Enterprise Auditor Console: %SAInstallDir%SADatabaseLogsApplication
Access Information Center (11.6): C:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsAccess Information Center
Access Information (11.5): C:inetpubwwwrootStealthAUDIT Compliance

Export of Job(s) – note jobs may be nested under multiple Groups:
Right click on the Job or Job Group experiencing problems and select Export. This creates .zip file containing all logs and configuration settings of your jobs that we can import and review.


From the Job Status Export the Messages Table, CSV is preferred:

You're welcome! If there's anything else you need assistance with please don't hesitate to create a new ticket. I will provide a closing summary below:

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved. The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Symptom

Error enumerating links for namespace \<a href='https://excellus.com' target='_blank'>excellus.com</a>DFSTest (Domain): The RPC server is unavailable. But we are using a different DFS config and unable to access or update in Audit

Cause

Host list assignment for the job was only targeting ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" which does not have the DFS Namespace Server. 

Resolution

Targeted the DFS Namespace server and was able to get a successful DFS scan. We verified the update folder paths in SQL server running a search query against the FSDFS_Links table.

Removed the duplicate DFS namespace and enabled the resolve links analysis. 

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Hello Gary,

I've been able to gather more information and it seems that there is an AIC Resources table that could possibly be updated but it will require involvement from our development team. Other than that the initial option of re-importing the resource paths is the only way unfortunately.

Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

 

Ugh – ok, so is there a way for us to just change the server name in in the column Resource Name without changing anything else or forcing the users to re-confirm ownership?

If we have to re-import all these folders the import process forces us to go back in and have user reconfirm ownership and we have to enable requesting and owner updates along with re-adding the groups.  



 

Thanks,

Gary

Hello Gary,

Yes, from my tests the paths should be shared within the namespace. Then running the FSDFS system scan against the DFS server and the FSAA system scan successfully completing with the possible inclusion of a higher file depth scan depending on how many levels deep the path goes, with the addition of a successful FSAA Bulk Import will display the DFS file path structure within the AIC console. In my test environment I am able to UNC to my network share as well as running a search against that network share in the AIC. Once I made that path sharable on my DFS server and ran the necessary scans it built a file structure within the AIC which is the screenshot. I have also nested folders into my DFS Namespace Server and those folders are accessible within the AIC now as well. 





Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NN0Rt:ref

 


Hi Scottie,

 

So to use DFS in the AIC all of the folders we currently have published will need to be shared out and defined in the DFS namespace? 

Below is our name space today, but almost everything we have published in the AIC is a subfolder under those directories that are defined in the DFS.



 

So for example, Rick has a folder published in the AIC \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest.   The DFS target would be \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest

 

If I search using the UNC I can see it (the same result happens when we try to publish a folder)



 

If I search using DFS I don’t (the same result when we try to publish a folder)



Thanks,

Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. If you're not seeing the path in the database then its not going to be displayed in the AIC as that's the reference the AIC uses to build its file structure. I would verify that the namespace is available on the DFS server. Then you'd need to get a successful FSDFS system scan, FSAA system scan and a FSAA Bulk Import before it will display in the AIC. I have tested this method in my lab and have gotten a few successful scans. I have provided screenshots below:



Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NN0Rt:ref

 


Hi Scottie/Tay,

 

After last nights scan it looks like it populated the DFS info we showed missing yesterday. 

To answer your question Scottie – No, I am not able to query  \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest in this table.  If you notice the highlighted line it only goes to  \w2rshr02DataShare.  Since that is the last shared folder before it breaks out to the individual folders we have published in the AIC.  We would think we could path down to those folders in the AIC as we did before.  Are we still missing something?  Should we be able to use the DFS path when publishing these folders in the AIC?  Can we set something up to walk through this?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. The Namespace Path (W2RSHR02.excellus.com) is the duplicate that was removed previous. That may be the cause to the Null values. We would need to run a query search on that table against the \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest resource path to verify that NEA is collecting that namespace. If its not collecting it and indexing into the SQL database you won't be able to run a search in the AIC for it. 

Thank you,

Hi Scottie,

 

I’m not sure we can query the data please see below:

 

This is STBPRDWAV003 – our Audit server that we believe DFS is function properly, DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID are populated.

 

 

This is STBPRDWAV002 – the problem AIC server, notice it does not have DFSHost ID TargetGateID and TargetResourceID.  Despite the DB having data when I select the Link NameSpace results it just spins and I have to kill the console ( See screen shot below this one).

Hi Scotty,

 

It is the REP_SPTest appended path that is not adding when we attempt to add \w2rshr02DataShareREP_SPTest

But the physical path shows as available to add: \shrprdwav007share-vold$REP_SPTest

The physical path is what I am looking to avoid in favor of the DFS path

 

The FSDS and FSAA Bulk imports have run since Tay helped us make the adjustments to get the FSDS job working.

 

I will have to defer to Gary regarding the SQL database queries.

 

Thanks,
Rick

Hi Gary,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. Are you experiencing an error when you attempt to add the resource?

Just for clarification, is it the REP_SPTest appended path that isn't being added or is it the rocshr50 path that isn't being added? 

If so, has NEA successfully completed its FSDFS system scan and Bulk Import and are those paths quarriable in the SQL database? 

Thank you,

Hi Tay – we do have an issue with the DFS.

 

I cannot pull in subfolders of the DFS shares into AIC resources.  Is there a setting that allows us to path through the top DFS folder?

 

Here’s the resource that I want to add via DFS path

 

 

It won’t open the folder via DFS

 

 

But let’s me take the top folder

 

 

Thanks,
Rick

Hey Team,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed a duplicate entry of \W2RSHR02.excellus.comData that did not have any links attached via the HostID
	Reran the FSDFS_SystemScan job
	Enabled the Resolve Links analysis tasks on both the FSAA System Scan and FSAA Bulk Import


Let me know how the AIC looks for the DFS stuff once that FS Job group completes!

Thank you,

Hello Gary,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host. 

Our next steps are:

Further investigate the file structure in the AIC and FSAA system scan against the desired hosts.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hi Scottie,

 

Thanks for the quick reply.  My responses are below in red – I will upload the logs as requested.  While capturing a couple screen shots I decided to rerun the DFS scan job (failed) and then reran the DFSHost List query.  I assume it is still running but I do not see any new servers in the list, but checking the log I see them.  Maybe I need to let it run

 

 

The new servers I would expect to see are

SHRPRDWAV007

SHRPRDWAV008

SHRPRDWAV009

SHRPRDWAV010

 

I also want to know if there is a way we might be able to update our existing shares in the AIC where we could replace the current name with the new server name?  Is there a way to update if we get the DFS working?

 

Thanks,

Gary

Hello Gary,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. 

To help us streamline the troubleshooting process and resolve your issue more efficiently, please provide the following information:  

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Users unable to request access to shares published in AIC; Share Owners unable to respond to access requests or administer access to the file shares.  Currently there are resource audits going on within the AIC, I do not know what affect this has on those yet, I will be finding out and can let you know/.
Who is affected by this issue? Anyone requesting access to published shares in the AIC, Share owners
What steps to troubleshoot the issue have already been taken? We have been working through the DFS share configuration to try and run scans to recognize DFS resources.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? While working the issue we are wondering if there is any way of rapidly changing current server names to new server names on any impacted resources.
Is this a new configuration, data collection or report? No, we have been using the AIC for many years -
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? 3 servers that hosted shares have been replaced.
When did this issue start?  We found out today.
What are the steps to reproduce? Request a resource in the AIC.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
 


Please perform the follow steps and upload the resulting Artifacts:

Enable Debug Logging
From the NEA Console > Settings > Application
Set Log Level to Debug
Rerun jobs that are failing to collect logs in full detail. Return Log level to warning afterwards.


Please provide logs from the following locations: 
Enterprise Auditor Console: %SAInstallDir%SADatabaseLogsApplication 
Access Information Center (11.6): C:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsAccess Information Center 
Access Information (11.5): C:inetpubwwwrootStealthAUDIT Compliance 

Export of Job(s) – note jobs may be nested under multiple Groups:
Right click on the Job or Job Group experiencing problems and select Export. This creates .zip file containing all logs and configuration settings of your jobs that we can import and review.
