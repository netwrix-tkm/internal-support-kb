I have two errors I shared in my attachment. The top error appeared after I had remoted into my session. I had left the session open on Friday but my RDP session timed out. I think this is why I got this error. Please correct me if i'm wrong. 
I clicked ok.  My SA console opened. The bottom error then appeared when trying to do anything on my console. 

Could this be happen if there are other SA admins logged in at the same time? Please explain what these two errors mean for me. Thanks. 

Respectfully, 
Sean","","","","Instructed the customer to completely close the NEA console and end the StealthAudit.exe processes within task manager. This resolved the errors that the customer was experiencing.

Resolution


Recommend switching the SQL host PageFile from the capped 12GB to the system managed on the C: Drive and request a reboot of the server.

New space allocated displays as 24 GB which resolved the issue.","Guidance","Scottie Taylor","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.6","","33.9","Closed - Resolved","Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC","Sean Steinberg","2024-07-10T20:19:01.000Z","2024-08-13T17:24:39.000Z"
