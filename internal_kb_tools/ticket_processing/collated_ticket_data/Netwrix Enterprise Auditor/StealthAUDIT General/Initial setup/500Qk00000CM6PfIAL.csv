File share activity

I am not getting file share activity information ever since server change and upgrade to 11.5. I am assuming I don't have the right jobs enabled, or they'll failing, but I would like to schedule a call to understand exactly what jobs do what and sort out any issues with them.
Cause

Discovered that the FSAC system scan job was completed with warnings. The warning stated a network path was not found an issue where the account used to access the activity log could not properly access the file path location. We also discovered that the file path was incorrectly assigned to the agent monitoring the activity.

Resolution

Once we made the change to the listed file path and updated it with the correct one we then ran the FSAC system scan job again and were successfully able to scan that host.","Guidance","Scottie Taylor","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.5","","25.6","Closed - Resolved","CPP Corp","Benjamin Tanner","2024-06-26T23:41:32.000Z","2024-07-22T15:01:07.000Z"
