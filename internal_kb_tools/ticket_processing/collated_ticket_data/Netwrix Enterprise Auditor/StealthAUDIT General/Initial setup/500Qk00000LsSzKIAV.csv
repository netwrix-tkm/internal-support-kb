Hello Team,

We currently have Netwrix Auditor and would like to stand up a new Server with the current Netwrix Auditor we have plus Sharepoint auditing.

Is there any chance someone can arrange a meeting with me and I can show you what we have on our current Netwrix environment and I can go ahead and stand up new servers and so forth.

Thank you","N/A","The customer wants to migrate from Netwrix Auditor to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. They want to do the configurations themselves but they dont want to engage Professional Support team.
