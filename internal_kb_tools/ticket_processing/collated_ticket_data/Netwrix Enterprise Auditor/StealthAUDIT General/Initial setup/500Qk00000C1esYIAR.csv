"500Qk00000C1esYIAR","00412315","Support Ticket","DB Server (MSSSQLSERVER): (PWDADDBG-887)- Remediation for CCS scan","I would like to clarify with you on DB Owner for NV Monitor Config, NV Monitor Data and Stealth AUDIT whereby their value is pointing to sqlservice.
Fyi, we are conducting Infra hardening and found this gap in CCS report. Currently CCS is checking for the value of e2psa/sqladmin.

Therefore, seeking your advice if we change the value to sqladmin/e2psa, would it impact the server performance?
