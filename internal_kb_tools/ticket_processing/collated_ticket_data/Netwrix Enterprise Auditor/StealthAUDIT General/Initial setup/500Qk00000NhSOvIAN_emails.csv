My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From your description it sounds like you're looking to do a new setup to monitor a new storage array, and use the old setup as the basis for this.
Can you confirm for me that this is correct?

I apologize for asking again, but are you just looking for information on how to scale the new VMs or do you need assistance doing the deployment and new configuration of this environment?
Below I have linked the documentation on our scaling suggestions based on what modules you plan to use in an environment. I wouldn't be able to provide much more than this and these are not hard numbers but basic suggestions that may change based on the environment.

I just wanted to follow up to gather a bit of extra info for our internal teams.
Can you tell me the reason that you're looking at a second deployment and not just adding the Isilon to the current environment? Is this a scale issue, or possibly isolated networks?

Hello Frank,

I apologize for asking again, but are you just looking for information on how to scale the new VMs or do you need assistance doing the deployment and new configuration of this environment?
Below I have linked the documentation on our scaling suggestions based on what modules you plan to use in an environment. I wouldn't be able to provide much more than this and these are not hard numbers but basic suggestions that may change based on the environment.

Hello Ian – that is correct. I do not have any of the VMs set up yet, but plan to build them on the same criteria that I’m using on my NetApp setup (see attachment)

 

Thanks
Frank

Hello Frank,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From your description it sounds like you're looking to do a new setup to monitor a new storage array, and use the old setup as the basis for this.
Can you confirm for me that this is correct?


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello Ian,

We are wanting two separate environments as our current deployment is very large. I don't think the database will be able to handle the additional data from the Isilon as I understand it is quite huge.

I can't afford to attempt to bring it into our system and risk a crash or performance degradation.

Hope this helps.

Thanks Ian - I plan to scale my new VMs to the same size as what I'm currently running. What I'm looking for is some assistance rolling the apps out as in the past we ran into some snags and having someone on the call we were able to resolve the issue and get it deployed.

I see that Sean is copied on this so I will see if he can assist me to get this up and running.

Take care!

After discussing internally we have to routes we could take to help you get your second environment setup.
The first would be to have the support team assist you with the basic setup. The support team can assist with the new install and setting up the ADI scan, but any additional configuration would need to be handled by your team.
The second would be to engage professional services. They can assist with the full setup and install but they would incur an additional cost.

Could you please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I will get this moving for you?

Thank you,

Thanks Ian – I plan to scale my new VMs to the same size as what I’m currently running. What I’m looking for is some assistance rolling the apps out as in the past we ran into some snags and having someone on the call we were able to resolve the issue and get it deployed.

 

I see that Sean is copied on this so I will see if he can assist me to get this up and running.

 

Take care!

Frank

Hello Frank,

I apologize for asking again, but are you just looking for information on how to scale the new VMs or do you need assistance doing the deployment and new configuration of this environment?
Below I have linked the documentation on our scaling suggestions based on what modules you plan to use in an environment. I wouldn't be able to provide much more than this and these are not hard numbers but basic suggestions that may change based on the environment.

Hello Ian – that is correct. I do not have any of the VMs set up yet, but plan to build them on the same criteria that I’m using on my NetApp setup (see attachment)

 

Thanks

Hello Frank,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From your description it sounds like you're looking to do a new setup to monitor a new storage array, and use the old setup as the basis for this.
Can you confirm for me that this is correct?


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello Frank,

After discussing internally we have to routes we could take to help you get your second environment setup.
The first would be to have the support team assist you with the basic setup. The support team can assist with the new install and setting up the ADI scan, but any additional configuration would need to be handled by your team.
The second would be to engage professional services. They can assist with the full setup and install but they would incur an additional cost.

Could you please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I will get this moving for you?

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Ian,

We are wanting two separate environments as our current deployment is very large. I don't think the database will be able to handle the additional data from the Isilon as I understand it is quite huge.

I can't afford to attempt to bring it into our system and risk a crash or performance degradation.

Hope this helps.

Hello Frank,

I just wanted to follow up to gather a bit of extra info for our internal teams.
Can you tell me the reason that you're looking at a second deployment and not just adding the Isilon to the current environment? Is this a scale issue, or possibly isolated networks?

Thank you,

Hello Frank,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From your description it sounds like you're looking to do a new setup to monitor a new storage array, and use the old setup as the basis for this.
Can you confirm for me that this is correct?


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Thanks Ian for the follow up. Can you advise on how many hours you think it will take to deploy?

 

@sean.comiskey@netwrix.com Based on this, please provide me with an estimate on a cost on Proserv hours as we are exploring other products, and I need a cost for comparison.

 

Thanks

Frank

Hello Frank,

After discussing internally we have to routes we could take to help you get your second environment setup.
The first would be to have the support team assist you with the basic setup. The support team can assist with the new install and setting up the ADI scan, but any additional configuration would need to be handled by your team.
The second would be to engage professional services. They can assist with the full setup and install but they would incur an additional cost.

Could you please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I will get this moving for you?

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000NhSOv:ref

 


Hello Ian,

 

We are wanting two separate environments as our current deployment is very large. I don’t think the database will be able to handle the additional data from the Isilon as I understand it is quite huge.

 

I can’t afford to attempt to bring it into our system and risk a crash or performance degradation.

 

Hope this helps.

Frank

Hello Frank,

I just wanted to follow up to gather a bit of extra info for our internal teams.
Can you tell me the reason that you're looking at a second deployment and not just adding the Isilon to the current environment? Is this a scale issue, or possibly isolated networks?

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello Frank,

I have reached out to the professional services team to get in contact with you and get your second setup scoped and setup for you.
We should be hearing back from them soon and as soon as I have confirmation from them I will let you know.

Thanks Ian – I plan to scale my new VMs to the same size as what I’m currently running. What I’m looking for is some assistance rolling the apps out as in the past we ran into some snags and having someone on the call we were able to resolve the issue and get it deployed.

 

I see that Sean is copied on this so I will see if he can assist me to get this up and running.

 

Take care!

Frank

Hello Frank,

I apologize for asking again, but are you just looking for information on how to scale the new VMs or do you need assistance doing the deployment and new configuration of this environment?
Below I have linked the documentation on our scaling suggestions based on what modules you plan to use in an environment. I wouldn't be able to provide much more than this and these are not hard numbers but basic suggestions that may change based on the environment.

Hello Ian – that is correct. I do not have any of the VMs set up yet, but plan to build them on the same criteria that I’m using on my NetApp setup (see attachment)

 

Thanks
Frank
