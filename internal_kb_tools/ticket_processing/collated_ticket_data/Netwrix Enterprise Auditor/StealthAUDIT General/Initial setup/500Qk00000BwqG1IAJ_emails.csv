Is the file server that is experiencing the Access Denied error a Windows 2022 file server? If so, I was informed by our development team that the below group membership requirements are needed for Windows 2022 and later:

Administrator, Access Control Assistance Operators, or Server Operator group membership. 

Please let me know if these group membership changes to the account used in the connection profile made a difference in the scan job results.

The scanning permissions seem to be fixed by using the Access Control Assistance Operators.
I do not see or Server Operator as an available choice.

We are seeing a new error now:

That message is just a warning informing you that it was unsuccessful in opening and parsing that test doc but does not stop or hinder the job from completing successfully.

DO NOT click on links. Never open an email attachment unless you're 100% sure it's from a trusted source and you are expecting it.


Dear Kellen,

I wanted to follow up because I have not heard from you since my last email. May I ask what the current status of the issue is?

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance on this case.
