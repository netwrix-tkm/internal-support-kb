Host lists are being updated with new hosts but old hosts don't get cleaned up. I suspect this is intentional as a server not responding temporarily or being offline we wouldn't want it removed, but this may also be leading to some of our other issues. We discussed cleaning up the stale hosts manually, but decided I would like to keep them temporarily as we will be setting up a clean server with a new database and I would like the current environment as is for comparison in troubleshooting.","","","","005Qk000002AJWTIA4","2024-12-13T00:43:01.000Z"
