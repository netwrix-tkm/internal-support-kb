Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we reviewed the Weak Password job and noticed it pointed to the wrong host list. We changed the host list and pointed to the same host list as the ADI job.
The Weak Password job failed to update the dictionary automatically. We collected the log, and I will review it and get back to you.
Please remember to upload the two files to this ticket.

Hi Michelle,

I emailed you the schedule link the same day after the meeting.

We reviewed the settings for the Notification in AIC and discovered that the mail server information was missing. We added the info and sent a test to your inbox, which was successfully delivered.
We will work on the weak password issue in our next meeting. To schedule the meeting, use the link below.

Hi Frantz,

 

I have uploaded the log file and also the error message text file for your review. 

 

Please note that I am unable to select an appropriate availability using the calendar link provided. The only option was tomorrow at 5:30pm AST, this time unfortunately is outside of my working hours. 

 

Could you share with me and update calendar? Thank you.

Hi Michelle,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we reviewed the Weak Password job and noticed it pointed to the wrong host list. We changed the host list and pointed to the same host list as the ADI job.
The Weak Password job failed to update the dictionary automatically. We collected the log, and I will review it and get back to you.
Please remember to upload the two files to this ticket.
You can use the link below to schedule a follow-up meeting.

Hi Michelle,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we reviewed the Weak Password job and noticed it pointed to the wrong host list. We changed the host list and pointed to the same host list as the ADI job.
The Weak Password job failed to update the dictionary automatically. We collected the log, and I will review it and get back to you.
Please remember to upload the two files to this ticket.
You can use the link below to schedule a follow-up meeting.

Sorry for the late reply.
It depends on how your security team locked it down. You can go to security under 'trusted site' and add the URL ""https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html,"" or you may have to make some changes to your firewall to allow you to connect to our site.

Hi Michelle,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we reviewed the Weak Password job and noticed it pointed to the wrong host list. We changed the host list and pointed to the same host list as the ADI job.
The Weak Password job failed to update the dictionary automatically. We collected the log, and I will review it and get back to you.
Please remember to upload the two files to this ticket.
You can use the link below to schedule a follow-up meeting.

Hi Michelle,

I emailed you the schedule link the same day after the meeting.

We reviewed the settings for the Notification in AIC and discovered that the mail server information was missing. We added the info and sent a test to your inbox, which was successfully delivered.
We will work on the weak password issue in our next meeting. To schedule the meeting, use the link below.
