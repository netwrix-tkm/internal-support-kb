Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we discussed what we need to move forward with the new implementation.
You mentioned that the SQL server and the NEA application server must be able to communicate with each other. We made a test connection (.udl) from the application server to the SQL server, and the test failed.
 
The SQL will play a big part, and we must ensure that both servers communicate well.
We reviewed the settings from the old system to get a better idea of how to proceed with the new implementation.
 
UDL test to check the SQL Server Connectivity:

In the next meeting, we will start with the new implementation.
 
Preparation for the next meeting:

Hello Marc,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we discussed what we need to move forward with the new implementation.
You mentioned that the SQL server and the NEA application server must be able to communicate with each other. We made a test connection (.udl) from the application server to the SQL server, and the test failed.
 
The SQL will play a big part, and we must ensure that both servers communicate well.
We reviewed the settings from the old system to get a better idea of how to proceed with the new implementation.
 
UDL test to check the SQL Server Connectivity:
https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/how-perform-udl-test-check-sql-server-connectivity
 
In the next meeting, we will start with the new implementation.
 
Preparation for the next meeting:
You can use the link below to log in to your Netwrix page, download the latest NEA and the AIC version, and move them to the server.
 
https://www.netwrix.com/my_products_int.html or netwrix.com/support and click My Products
 
Before you move the installer to the server, right-click on the zip folder, click on Properties, and make sure the file is unblocked.

The reason the job wouldn’t run is that we never gave the service account access to the app! Corrected that and it ran as it should.

Hi Marc,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we installed NEA on the new server.
We ensured the connection to the SQL server was successful, and the database was created for the new implementation.
In the next meeting, we will review the schedule setting to ensure that the job can run according to the schedule.
 
You can use the link below to schedule the follow-up meeting.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for the update.

If Port 4498 is open, the Activity Monitor should receive data from the Domain Controller. Please let me know what the network team said.

No logs received. I have reached out to our network team to see if the port is open.  I reviewed the documents that I submitted for the project and 4498 was not a port that I requested. I'll keep you posted.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we set up the loopback address in the NTP configuration so that Activity Monitor can receive data from the agent.
You will monitor the Activity Monitor and provide an update.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for the update.

If Port 4498 is open, the Activity Monitor should receive data from the Domain Controller. Please let me know what the network team said.

No logs received. I have reached out to our network team to see if the port is open.  I reviewed the documents that I submitted for the project and 4498 was not a port that I requested. I'll keep you posted.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we set up the loopback address in the NTP configuration so that Activity Monitor can receive data from the agent.
You will monitor the Activity Monitor and provide an update.

Hi Marc,

Yes, you can schedule the meeting. We need to update the NTP setting to allow the DC to communicate with the Activity Monitor.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for the screenshot.
I will close ticker 00439526. I created it to install the Threat Prevention, which we did. I will close it and continue working on the issue with the Activity Monitor.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we set up the loopback address in the NTP configuration so that Activity Monitor can receive data from the agent.
You will monitor the Activity Monitor and provide an update.

Yes, you can schedule the meeting. We need to update the NTP setting to allow the DC to communicate with the Activity Monitor.

Hello Jean,

 

I need to get this working as soon as possible. Why do Groups, Users, Computers, and Group Policy work in the Active Direcotry job tree. But Domains and Activity do not? Why in the Collection job under Activity do I get ACCESS DENIED to the Domain Controller yet the other job trees above work using the same account??

Hi Marc,
 
Yes, you can schedule the meeting. We need to update the NTP setting to allow the DC to communicate with the Activity Monitor.

Hello Jean,

I need to get this working as soon as possible. Why do Groups, Users, Computers, and Group Policy work in the Active Direcotry job tree. But Domains and Activity do not? Why in the Collection job under Activity do I get ACCESS DENIED to the Domain Controller yet the other job trees above work using the same account??

Hi Marc,

Thank you for the screenshot.
I will close ticker 00439526. I created it to install the Threat Prevention, which we did. I will close it and continue working on the issue with the Activity Monitor.

If Port 4498 is open, the Activity Monitor should receive data from the Domain Controller. Please let me know what the network team said.

No logs received. I have reached out to our network team to see if the port is open.  I reviewed the documents that I submitted for the project and 4498 was not a port that I requested. I'll keep you posted.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we set up the loopback address in the NTP configuration so that Activity Monitor can receive data from the agent.
You will monitor the Activity Monitor and provide an update.

Hello Jean,

 

I need to get this working as soon as possible. Why do Groups, Users, Computers, and Group Policy work in the Active Direcotry job tree. But Domains and Activity do not? Why in the Collection job under Activity do I get ACCESS DENIED to the Domain Controller yet the other job trees above work using the same account??

Hi Marc,
 
Thank you for the screenshot.
I will close ticker 00439526. I created it to install the Threat Prevention, which we did. I will close it and continue working on the issue with the Activity Monitor.

Hi Marc,
 
Thank you for the update.
 
If Port 4498 is open, the Activity Monitor should receive data from the Domain Controller. Please let me know what the network team said.

No logs received. I have reached out to our network team to see if the port is open.  I reviewed the documents that I submitted for the project and 4498 was not a port that I requested. I’ll keep you posted.

Hi Marc,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we set up the loopback address in the NTP configuration so that Activity Monitor can receive data from the agent.
You will monitor the Activity Monitor and provide an update.

Hi Marc,
 
Yes, you can schedule the meeting. We need to update the NTP setting to allow the DC to communicate with the Activity Monitor.

Hi Marc,
 
Thank you for the screenshot.
I will close ticker 00439526. I created it to install the Threat Prevention, which we did. I will close it and continue working on the issue with the Activity Monitor.

Hi Marc,
 
Thank you for the update.
 
If Port 4498 is open, the Activity Monitor should receive data from the Domain Controller. Please let me know what the network team said.

No logs received. I have reached out to our network team to see if the port is open.  I reviewed the documents that I submitted for the project and 4498 was not a port that I requested. I’ll keep you posted.

Hi Marc,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we set up the loopback address in the NTP configuration so that Activity Monitor can receive data from the agent.
You will monitor the Activity Monitor and provide an update.

Hi Marc,
 
Yes, you can schedule the meeting. We need to update the NTP setting to allow the DC to communicate with the Activity Monitor.

FYI...my manager asked me again yesterday if we completed all of the tasks for the Netwrix install.  I informed him that we had this and the Entra piece left. He said that we need to get this resolved as soon as possible.

Hello Jean,

I need to get this working as soon as possible. Why do Groups, Users, Computers, and Group Policy work in the Active Direcotry job tree. But Domains and Activity do not? Why in the Collection job under Activity do I get ACCESS DENIED to the Domain Controller yet the other job trees above work using the same account??

Hi Marc,

Thank you for the screenshot.
I will close ticker 00439526. I created it to install the Threat Prevention, which we did. I will close it and continue working on the issue with the Activity Monitor.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for the update.
Please send me a screenshot of the NTP setting where we added the loopback address.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for the update.

If Port 4498 is open, the Activity Monitor should receive data from the Domain Controller. Please let me know what the network team said.

No logs received. I have reached out to our network team to see if the port is open.  I reviewed the documents that I submitted for the project and 4498 was not a port that I requested. I'll keep you posted.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we set up the loopback address in the NTP configuration so that Activity Monitor can receive data from the agent.
You will monitor the Activity Monitor and provide an update.

Hi Marc,

Yes, you can schedule the meeting. We need to update the NTP setting to allow the DC to communicate with the Activity Monitor.

Thanks, Jean,

 

FYI…my manager asked me again yesterday if we completed all of the tasks for the Netwrix install.  I informed him that we had this and the Entra piece left. He said that we need to get this resolved as soon as possible.

Hello Jean,

 

I need to get this working as soon as possible. Why do Groups, Users, Computers, and Group Policy work in the Active Direcotry job tree. But Domains and Activity do not? Why in the Collection job under Activity do I get ACCESS DENIED to the Domain Controller yet the other job trees above work using the same account??

Hi Marc,
 
Thank you for the update.
 
If Port 4498 is open, the Activity Monitor should receive data from the Domain Controller. Please let me know what the network team said.

No logs received. I have reached out to our network team to see if the port is open.  I reviewed the documents that I submitted for the project and 4498 was not a port that I requested. I’ll keep you posted.

Hi Marc,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we set up the loopback address in the NTP configuration so that Activity Monitor can receive data from the agent.
You will monitor the Activity Monitor and provide an update.

Hi Marc,
 
Yes, you can schedule the meeting. We need to update the NTP setting to allow the DC to communicate with the Activity Monitor.

Thanks, Jean,

 

FYI…my manager asked me again yesterday if we completed all of the tasks for the Netwrix install.  I informed him that we had this and the Entra piece left. He said that we need to get this resolved as soon as possible.

Hello Jean,

 

I need to get this working as soon as possible. Why do Groups, Users, Computers, and Group Policy work in the Active Direcotry job tree. But Domains and Activity do not? Why in the Collection job under Activity do I get ACCESS DENIED to the Domain Controller yet the other job trees above work using the same account??

Hi Marc,
 
Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we set up the loopback address in the NTP configuration so that Activity Monitor can receive data from the agent.
You will monitor the Activity Monitor and provide an update.
 
Thanks,

Hi Marc,
 
Yes, you can schedule the meeting. We need to update the NTP setting to allow the DC to communicate with the Activity Monitor.

Hello Jean,

 

Do you have a solution for the Activity Monitor? I didn’t want to schedule a meeting if you weren’t ready.

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we reviewed the settings in Activity Monitor, checked the DC's log, and discovered that the Loop Back address failed to communicate with the server.
We discovered Carbon Black installed on the same DC, which could be the reason for the LoopBack failure.
We created a new ticket for the Activity Monitor and sent you the meeting invite from the new ticket.

Thanks, Jean,

 

FYI…my manager asked me again yesterday if we completed all of the tasks for the Netwrix install.  I informed him that we had this and the Entra piece left. He said that we need to get this resolved as soon as possible.

Hello Jean,

 

I need to get this working as soon as possible. Why do Groups, Users, Computers, and Group Policy work in the Active Direcotry job tree. But Domains and Activity do not? Why in the Collection job under Activity do I get ACCESS DENIED to the Domain Controller yet the other job trees above work using the same account??

No logs received. I have reached out to our network team to see if the port is open.  I reviewed the documents that I submitted for the project and 4498 was not a port that I requested. I’ll keep you posted.

Hi Marc,
 
Yes, you can schedule the meeting. We need to update the NTP setting to allow the DC to communicate with the Activity Monitor.

Hello Jean,

 

Do you have a solution for the Activity Monitor? I didn’t want to schedule a meeting if you weren’t ready.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we reviewed the settings in Activity Monitor, checked the DC's log, and discovered that the Loop Back address failed to communicate with the server.
We discovered Carbon Black installed on the same DC, which could be the reason for the LoopBack failure.
We created a new ticket for the Activity Monitor and sent you the meeting invite from the new ticket.

Thanks,

FYI...my manager asked me again yesterday if we completed all of the tasks for the Netwrix install.  I informed him that we had this and the Entra piece left. He said that we need to get this resolved as soon as possible.

Hello Jean,

I need to get this working as soon as possible. Why do Groups, Users, Computers, and Group Policy work in the Active Direcotry job tree. But Domains and Activity do not? Why in the Collection job under Activity do I get ACCESS DENIED to the Domain Controller yet the other job trees above work using the same account??

Hi Marc,

Thank you for the screenshot.
I will close ticker 00439526. I created it to install the Threat Prevention, which we did. I will close it and continue working on the issue with the Activity Monitor.

No logs received. I have reached out to our network team to see if the port is open.  I reviewed the documents that I submitted for the project and 4498 was not a port that I requested. I'll keep you posted.

Hi Marc,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, we set up the loopback address in the NTP configuration so that Activity Monitor can receive data from the agent.
You will monitor the Activity Monitor and provide an update.

Thanks,

Hi Marc,

Yes, you can schedule the meeting. We need to update the NTP setting to allow the DC to communicate with the Activity Monitor.
