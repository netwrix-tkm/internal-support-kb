We will soon be changing our how Access Analyzer works and are planning to set up a new instance. Our existing instance has its own SQL Database Server on the same machine as the analyzer runs. For our new instance we were hoping to offload the SQL side to our Azure SQL Database instance. Is this support and if so do you have any documentation on it?.. as the documentation only seems to cover connection to on-premise SQL servers.","","-------------

Customer is interested if NAA supports Azure as backed for SQL DB. 

According to latest information from our Netwrix Access Analyzer help center this is provided as SQL Server Requirements:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AccessAnalyzer_12.0/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Overview.htm
 

The server requirements include one of the following SQL Server versions:

    SQL Server 2016 through SQL Server 2022

    Azure SQL Managed Instances

Additionally the server must meet this requirement:

    US English language installation

     

As such, whether it is as VM in Azure cloud that is running SQL server instance, or if it is an Azure SQL Managed Instance - both are suitable as a SQL database server.","","According to latest information from our Netwrix Access Analyzer help center this is provided as SQL Server Requirements:
