"00aQk000009D0ppIAC","500Qk00000FJPoUIAX","We reviewed the Activity job and Bulk Import in today's meeting.
We agreed that the Bulk Import was fine; the database was locked because two of them were running simultaneously.
Â 
The log for the Activity Scan doesn't show much about the issue. It still shows 0 under the Duration in StealthAUDIT. 
I suspected it was a bug. Since the customer is on 11.6.0.88, we will upgrade the customer to the latest version of 11.6

The customer discovered that running the Bulk Import manually and running the scan fixes the issue with the scan's time stamp, but it doesn't happen automatically.
We also noticed an issue with the SP_TrusteeAudit job failing because the tempdb is full.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-09-30T16:31:15.000Z","2024-09-30T16:31:15.000Z","false","false"
