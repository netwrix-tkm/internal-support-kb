Thank you for sharing this information.

You mentioned that recently some jobs were enabled that were previously in disabled status. As such, increase in RAM consumption is expected because additional jobs started running and thus more RAM is needed on SQL server.

Which jobs exactly were enabled recently? Which jobs exactly are currently running on your Netwrix Access Analyzer (formerly Enterprise Auditor) server?

Thank you for your time on our meeting today.
I am glad that we had a closer look at the issue today together with your team.

The following is a recap of what we did:

Today we saw that SQL server RAM utilization was at 94%.
I then checked Enterprise Auditor for any running jobs or tasks - but there were no instances of running jobs in Enterprise Auditor console. 
Also, the Enterprise Auditor logs were investigated and they did not indicate any actively running tasks.
We also checked if there are any active connections to SQL server by opening SSMS and running this query:

SELECT
    session_id,
    login_name,
    host_name,
    program_name,
    login_time,
    status
FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions

Result showed us that the only active connection was the one we created using SQL Server Management Studio.

Since Netwrix Enterprise Auditor was not actively running any tasks - it was suggested to ask for assistance from database administrator from your team.
As we discussed with database administrator  - it is expected from Microsoft SQL Server to keep allocated memory even if the task that required this RAM is not running anymore. This is because Microsoft SQL server uses allocated RAM as a buffer to improve server performance.

As such, database administrator suggested adding a cap for SQL server to keep RAM utilization under 90%.
A cap for 30 GB of RAM was added by changing this setting using SSMS: Database Instance > Properties > Memory > Server memory options settings.

I will proceed with closing of this ticket, but you can always re-open the case if any related issues return.
In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you.
