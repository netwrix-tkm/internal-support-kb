"500Qk00000HrPHrIAN","00425917","Support Ticket","Locating PII Using DLP scans","Hello,

Previously, just based on old reports, it looks like we were able to find some PII using the DLP scans in StealthAUDIT. As of now, though, when we run them, it is returning no data even though we know there are files on the servers that have PII. We haven't been able to figure out why it's not returning any data and would like some assistance, thanks!","","Sensitive Data was not installed","I am waiting for an update from the customer before I can close this ticket.","I downloaded and installed the Sensitive data.","Guidance","Frantz Baptiste","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.6","","7.9","Closed - Resolved","Metropolitan State University of Denver","Latonya Frank","2024-11-04T15:40:37.000Z","2024-11-12T14:19:24.000Z"
