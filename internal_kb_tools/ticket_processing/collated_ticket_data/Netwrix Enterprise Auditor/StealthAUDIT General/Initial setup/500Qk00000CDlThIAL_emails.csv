Thank you for your time today.
 In today's meeting, we reviewed your SQL jobs and acknowledged that the running time had increased after the upgrade.
We noticed the number of threats assigned to the job (4 threats), and we suspected that could be one reason why it was taking longer to run. We agreed to increase it to 8 to see if that made any difference. I will review the log to see if there is anything related to the increase in the time.
You can reply to this email to provide an update. Let me know if increasing the number of threats makes a difference.

Hello Frantz,



Thank you for the prompt response on this case yesterday. Yes, we increased the number of threads to 8 and we are monitoring for any changes or improvement. I’ve added my colleagues Ryan and Paige, who were also on the call with us yesterday, so they can share any updates here. Thank you.

Hi Naeemah,

Thank you for your time today.
 In today's meeting, we reviewed your SQL jobs and acknowledged that the running time had increased after the upgrade.
We noticed the number of threats assigned to the job (4 threats), and we suspected that could be one reason why it was taking longer to run. We agreed to increase it to 8 to see if that made any difference. I will review the log to see if there is anything related to the increase in the time.
You can reply to this email to provide an update. Let me know if increasing the number of threats makes a difference.

Thanks,

One of my colleagues mentioned to me that he discovered an internal SSH  issue with some of your servers, and the public key is missing for some of them. These issues will contribute to the amount of time it takes for the job to run. The first thing is to work on these failing jobs.
You will need to fix the missing public key and the SSH issue before our next meeting.

Thank you for your time today.
 In today's meeting, we reviewed your SQL jobs and acknowledged that the running time had increased after the upgrade.
We noticed the number of threats assigned to the job (4 threats), and we suspected that could be one reason why it was taking longer to run. We agreed to increase it to 8 to see if that made any difference. I will review the log to see if there is anything related to the increase in the time.
You can reply to this email to provide an update. Let me know if increasing the number of threats makes a difference.
 
Thanks,

Hi Franz,

Hope you are well. Apologies for the delayed response. I believe the team has figured out that it was the number of threads that caused the slowness in the job collections on these servers. They increased the threads to the same numbers as it is currently in production and feedback from last Friday was that the jobs were running faster. I will connect with the team again and send you a final confirmation to close this case tomorrow. Thank you for your assistance on this matter.

Kind regards,

Naeemah Robert.

Hello Frantz,

Thank you for the prompt response on this case yesterday. Yes, we increased the number of threads to 8 and we are monitoring for any changes or improvement. I’ve added my colleagues Ryan and Paige, who were also on the call with us yesterday, so they can share any updates here. Thank you.
