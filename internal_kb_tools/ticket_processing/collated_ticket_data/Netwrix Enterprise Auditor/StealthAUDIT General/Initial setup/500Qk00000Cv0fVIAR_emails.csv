Hi Frantz,

I checked with our network team, and they confirmed that port 4498 was not blocked. I was able to fix the problem by uninstalling the agent from BRPW-FS01 and deleting it from the monitor on BRP-SMP-APP, the re-installing and re-adding. I think somehow the agent install that we did during the call got corrupted. It looks like some data is going to our MDR now from the activity monitor, so we can close the ticket.
