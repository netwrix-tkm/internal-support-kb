Hi Duane,

As a test, we would like you to remove all three entries under the Access tab, save the changes, and rerun the scan to see if it still gets flagged for vulnerability.
You can reply to this email to provide an update.

Hi Duane,
 
You can close the console and launch it as a service account. Once the console is up, you can verify if you have access to add or remove access.

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, you clarified the question concerning the vulnerability.
I did some research and found that we don't have documentation I could send you concerning the permissions for these two specific files: VaultService.exe and WebServer.exe.
You have all these permissions because you have users in the administrator group under Settings> Access. If these users were only Report Viewer or Job Viewer, it would only show two permissions (Read & Execute and Read).
The permission will depend on who has access to the console. Adding a user to the ""Access"" and giving them Administrator will automatically show all four permissions.
 
Thanks,

Only the Stealth Audit administrators have console access.  Server admins and users do not have access to console by default.

If I change User access to Read & Execute Read, will that have any impact to the use of the AIC?

Hi Duane,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, you clarified the question concerning the vulnerability.
I did some research and found that we don't have documentation I could send you concerning the permissions for these two specific files: VaultService.exe and WebServer.exe.
You have all these permissions because you have users in the administrator group under Settings> Access. If these users were only Report Viewer or Job Viewer, it would only show two permissions (Read & Execute and Read).
The permission will depend on who has access to the console. Adding a user to the ""Access"" and giving them Administrator will automatically show all four permissions.

Thanks,

You can close the console and launch it as a service account. Once the console is up, you can verify if you have access to add or remove access.

Hi Duane,

The AIC functionality shouldn't be affected by any changes to the permissions on WebServer.exe or VaultService.exe.

Thank you,

Thanks for checking in.  I wanted to ask if the AIC functionality would be impacted if I changed the permission on WebServer.exe or VaultService.exe, or both?
