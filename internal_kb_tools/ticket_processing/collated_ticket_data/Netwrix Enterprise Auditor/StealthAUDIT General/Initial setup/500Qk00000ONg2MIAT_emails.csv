Thank you for the update.
 
I noticed you are still on the 11.5 version; we strongly advise that you upgrade to at least the 11.6 version.
 
Regarding the service account's complexity, you shouldn't have any problem with StealthAUDIT (Netwrix Access Analyzer), but Windows sometimes dislikes some characters. I will double-check with our development team for StealthAUDIT and let you know.
