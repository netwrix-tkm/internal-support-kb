Thank you for the updated information. If there are multiple different issues then new tickets will need to be created to address those issues. If you would like to provide artifacts for each issue so that I can create new tickets for them that would be best or you have the option of creating those tickets as well for each issue. This will help keep these issues streamlined for our technical notes. We were able to implement multiple least-privilege models such as role-based access and creating multiple connection profiles for each job.

I do not think that we fully implemented the least privileged model as there are many jobs that are still not running properly. I would think that would point to the least privileged model not working yet.
If you want to create tickets for each job that is failing that is fine, I just want them working with the non domain admin account.

I was going to put the jobserrors in this email but it would be huge so I created a word doc with formatted so make it easier to separate each issue.

Let me know if you have more questions

Thank you for the updated information. I was able to review the messages provided in the word document and these errors would not be a result of utilizing the least privileged model that we've implemented. There would be multiple different possible causes to these messages being prompted in these jobs. Some of these errors could be a result of the test job configurations similar to what we found in the test file system jobs compared to the out of the box file system jobs due to the slight differences between the prod and the test environment. Some of these messages are associated with the activity monitor agents such as the FSAC system scan message and the AD_ActivityCollection. That wouldn't be caused by the LPM being used in NEA. If you'd like to review them together on a call we can and I have provided a follow-up meeting below:

I do not think that we fully implemented the least privileged model as there are many jobs that are still not running properly. I would think that would point to the least privileged model not working yet.

If you want to create tickets for each job that is failing that is fine, I just want them working with the non domain admin account.

 

I was going to put the jobserrors in this email but it would be huge so I created a word doc with formatted so make it easier to separate each issue.

 

Let me know if you have more questions

 


Thanks

 

Jason

Hi Jason,

Thank you for the updated information. If there are multiple different issues then new tickets will need to be created to address those issues. If you would like to provide artifacts for each issue so that I can create new tickets for them that would be best or you have the option of creating those tickets as well for each issue. This will help keep these issues streamlined for our technical notes. We were able to implement multiple least-privilege models such as role-based access and creating multiple connection profiles for each job. We also discussed the process of incorporating gMSA, are there any other additional least privileged models you're interested in implementing?

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved. The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Symptom

Assistance configuring a least privilege access model

Cause

No Root Cause. Testing a viable LPM in a dev environment for future implementation into the production environment. 

Resolution

Reviewed the configurations for some jobs within the File System parent group and verified that the service account being used in the connection profile of the job is successfully completing and capturing data with the implementation of the least privileged model.

We also identified the below error within the FSAC system scan job.

GetFSACIniAttributeValue: Error: Ini section for CAWDCAPP322 does not exist in ini file C:ProgramDataNetwrixActivity MonitorAgentSBTFileMon.ini""  CAWDCAPP322

We verified that this error is valid due to the ini file not having the agent hostname listed in the configuration file. Due to the nature of using the agent as a proxy to monitor file system activity on a Unity host the agent hostname is not listed within the ini file but the Unity hosts are listed.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor
