He wants to close the ticket","close ticket","I have confirmed that you can use a gMSA account for Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) to write to SQL. Ultimately, you just need to set the storage account to Windows Auth, then set the Schedule account to the gMSA. There are some caveats:

Whenever you launch the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) console, the account you are using must have SQL access. Ideally, you would grant access in SQL to a group and include the account(s) you use to manage the NEA console in that group. Also, when creating the gMSA connection profile in Settings > Schedule, the account that you signed into the NEA console with needs to be included in the gMSA's PrincipalsAllowedToRetrieveManagedPassword. Otherwise, it will fail to save the connection profile.","Guidance","Joshua Sexton","Question","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.6","127","18.9","Closed - Resolved","Cowen & Company","Terry Asson","2025-02-13T15:59:37.000Z","2025-03-04T14:45:02.000Z"
