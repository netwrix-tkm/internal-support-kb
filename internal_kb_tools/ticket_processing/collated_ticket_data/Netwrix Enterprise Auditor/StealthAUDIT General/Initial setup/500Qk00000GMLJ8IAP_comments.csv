from the T1 Handbook:
If a prospective customer asks for a quote, evaluation extension or has another sales-related question, get approval from your Team Lead or Support Manager and then reply to the customer as follows and include the corresponding Account Manager in the CC field: 
â€œI have copied your Account Manager on this email; he (she) will follow up with you concerning this matter"".
Put the ticket into Awaiting Sales and follow up with the Account Manager using internal email or chat daily. If the Account Manager does not reply for two days, CC their manager (you can find the right person in the organizational chart). If there is still no reaction, inform your Team Lead or Manager. Once the Account Manager has confirmed their response to the customer, follow up with the customer to ensure that there are no issues requiring technical assistance. Assuming there are no such issues, ask if you could go ahead and close the ticket. If other issues are present, open a new ticket and continue working with the customer accordingly.","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2024-09-27T19:11:58.000Z","2024-09-27T19:11:58.000Z","false","false"
