In order to best advise your course of action we must fully understand why you enabled TLS1.0 during your deployment.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor has no specific requirement for TLS 1.0 and relies on the operating system to assign proper standards.

If I were to hazard a guess, I think you needed TLS 1.0 in 2020 because you were still using Internet Explorer to load the AIC on the host.  If the conditions that required you to enable TLS 1.0 no longer exist in your environment you can safely disable TLS 1.0. This is dependent on your environment - it is not determined by any requirement of Enterprise Auditor.

Hello Praveen,

In order to best advise your course of action we must fully understand why you enabled TLS1.0 during your deployment.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor has no specific requirement for TLS 1.0 and relies on the operating system to assign proper standards.

If I were to hazard a guess, I think you needed TLS 1.0 in 2020 because you were still using Internet Explorer to load the AIC on the host.  If the conditions that required you to enable TLS 1.0 no longer exist in your environment you can safely disable TLS 1.0. This is dependent on your environment - it is not determined by any requirement of Enterprise Auditor.

Thank you,

Hi Ilya,

I am sorry as we cannot do this. “Disable and see” No, we are talking about production environment, and this is not allowed at all. I remember TLS is enabled and Ciphers also configured on the server.

Please be sure whether to disable or keep the settings as it is.

Hi Ilya,

Yes, the audit team here have conducted the scan for vulnerabilities on all servers. They found this TLS 1.0 which is outdated and not so secured is enabled on Stealth audit server.

I remember in 2020 along with Professional support, we have enabled them for ciphers to make AIC work on the server.

Hello Praveen,

In order to best advise your course of action we must fully understand why you enabled TLS1.0 during your deployment.

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor has no specific requirement for TLS 1.0 and relies on the operating system to assign proper standards.

If I were to hazard a guess, I think you needed TLS 1.0 in 2020 because you were still using Internet Explorer to load the AIC on the host.  If the conditions that required you to enable TLS 1.0 no longer exist in your environment you can safely disable TLS 1.0. This is dependent on your environment - it is not determined by any requirement of Enterprise Auditor.

Thank you,

Brandon West

Hi Ilya,

I am sorry as we cannot do this. “Disable and see” No, we are talking about production environment, and this is not allowed at all. I remember TLS is enabled and Ciphers also configured on the server.

Please be sure whether to disable or keep the settings as it is.

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen V Huilgol

Praveen, Our applications do not require TLS 1. 0, as it is very outdated. Disable it and see if the application functions properly. If it doesn't it would be obvious quite fast, and would mean that your settings were modified to use that

Hi,

Disabling TLS will not have any impact on the application? Please confirm or lets connect once for the discussion.

Hi Ilya,

Yes, the audit team here have conducted the scan for vulnerabilities on all servers. They found this TLS 1.0 which is outdated and not so secured is enabled on Stealth audit server.

I remember in 2020 along with Professional support, we have enabled them for ciphers to make AIC work on the server.
