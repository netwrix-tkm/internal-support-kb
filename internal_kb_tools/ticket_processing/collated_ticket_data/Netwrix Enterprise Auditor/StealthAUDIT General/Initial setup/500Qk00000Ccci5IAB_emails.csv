Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

#Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA) install path
$env:SAINSTALLDIR 

#Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) install path
(Get-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesAccessInformationCenter""-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).ImagePath.Replace(""`"""", """").Replace(""BinAccessInformationCenter.Service.exe"", """")

Please note any changes in what is being scanned with NEA that could also point to the root of the issue.

Within SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) run the following TSQL the output can then be saved as CSV files then merged together within Excel or Copy with headers and pasted into an Excel file for review.

You can close the case. The issue was due to SQL Logging being set to Full instead of Simple.
