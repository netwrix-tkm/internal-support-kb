Reviewed the FSDFS System Scan and discovered errors when targeting the One Domain Controller Per Domain host list versus the DFS Host. Once the DFS server was targeted we were able to get a successful scan and populated updated DFS Namespace information with a successful FSAA Bulk Import. We then tested this information within the AIC with a fresh Bulk Import and was able to run a search against the new DFS Namespace target path. We further tested this information by running a SQL query filtering against an old host and wasn't able to generate any entries but was able to generate entries running a query against the new host.","","","","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2025-03-27T18:41:14.000Z"
