Hi Saqib, we have Dev and Prod environments. The dev has its own AD and ServiceNow environments. Now I added a test environment having separate DB and ServiceNow instances but looks/view at the Prod AD. This would allow me to see almost the Prod environment except where the ServiceNow tickets are created.

Everyday , I am learning how the NEA works including how jobs are being configure.

For this ticket, I think I may have found the issue and doing further testing. Then will update you.

I hope there is a better way to move settings/configurations from Dev to Test and to Prod.","Netwrix Support Ticket #438908 - Jo to get ticket status from ServiceNow just showed 1 result","don.boncodin@bakermckenzie.com","Don Boncodin","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-03-17T22:29:51.000Z","true"

I hope you are doing well. Since I didn't hear back from you after my last email, I am assuming the issue was resolved after verifying the scheduled tasks and verifying if duplicate jobs were running. As such this incident will now be closed. If you require further information, the incident ticket can be reopened within 30 days, after this time a new ticket can be created and linked to this incident ticket for history.

Have a great day!
