11.03.2025 

Had a meeting with Alison. 

They would like to remove FSAA related data for hosts that are no longer scanned. 
I explained that FS_Droptables job will remove absolutely all File System solution data and it is not possible to scope it. 
But we can remove data for individual hosts using ""remove host data"" query instead. 

Alison said that those hosts which last scan date is older than December 2024 are eligible for data removal. 

As such, we made a static host list by filtering FSAA hosts table using this query:
SELECT *
FROM [J4D_StealthAudit_AEM].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_Hosts]
WHERE ScanTime < '2024-12-01 00:00:00'
ORDER BY ScanTime;

We then configured this static host list in ""Hosts"" settings for the ""DropFSHostData"" Job we created using instructions from this KB:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000001qvpKAA.html

Currently ""DropFSHostData"" Job is running. 
Alison will get back to us with results once the job finishes.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-03-11T16:05:05.000Z"
