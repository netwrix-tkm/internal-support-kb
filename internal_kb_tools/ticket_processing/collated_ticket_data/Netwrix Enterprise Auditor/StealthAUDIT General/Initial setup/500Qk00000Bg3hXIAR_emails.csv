In the meeting, we discovered the issue was not with the StealthAUDIT application but with Intercept or Defend.
We logged in to the SI console but could not identify the policy responsible for pushing the alert to users.
As per our conversation, you have two users who have access to the HR folder. You don't want the alert to trigger when they access the HR folder, so you want to add an exception to that policy.
The first thing we need to do is determine which policy is responsible for sending the alert and whether an exemption for these two users can be added.
 
You can use the link below to schedule the follow-up meeting.
