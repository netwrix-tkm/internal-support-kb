Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Frantz, and I will assist you with this issue.
We use Java for Sensitive Data, but it's embedded in the product; it has nothing to do with Java you have installed on your machine.
Uninstalling Java will not affect our product
 
Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 
Thanks,

No, I believe this answered my question, if there is a need for Java on that server it would be from our own doing, thank you!
