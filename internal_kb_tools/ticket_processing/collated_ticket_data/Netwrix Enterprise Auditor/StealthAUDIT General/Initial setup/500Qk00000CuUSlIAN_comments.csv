Hi Sean,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. This is probably caused by a memory leak from having the NEA application open for an extended period of time. When you attempt to open the NEA console can you send a screenshot of the resources tab within the task manager? This will give us an idea if the application is using a large percentage of memory. 

Additionally, while the console is trying to launch can you provide an Application log for the NEA console? This log can be found within the file path Program Files (x86)StealthAuditSADatabaseLogsApplication. Please provide a standard .tsv log and a debug log if possible. 

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor","00570000003KXurAAG","2024-07-26T18:08:11.000Z","2024-07-26T18:08:11.000Z","false","false"

Might also need a final reboot post the CrowdStrike cashing the host, possible Database Integrity Check.
