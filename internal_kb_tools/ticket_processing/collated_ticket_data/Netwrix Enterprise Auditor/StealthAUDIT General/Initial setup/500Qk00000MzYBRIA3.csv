"500Qk00000MzYBRIA3","00438908","Support Ticket","Jo to get ticket status from ServiceNow just showed 1 result","I have the ff jobs in my test environment:
1. Setup and Calculate - checks the non-compliant accounts
2. Get Status - gets the status of the tickets relating to the item 1 above
3. Create new ticket based on the results of item 2 above.

Now since job 2 showed only 1 result, job 3 creates duplicate tickets even if there are existing ticket for the account in item 1.

Attached are the logs.","Unable to reproduce as this is a custom job","The customer appears to be running a custom job designed by PSO for them that involves integration of NEA with ServiceNow. As per customer, they are seeing duplicate tickets getting generated. As far as I have observed, they have copied over the same job and made it a part of custom Job Group (folder). I have asked them a number of questions apart from standard template in my initial response to assess the situation if it requires support help or PSO:

From the screenshot image you have shared, it appears that the solution/jobs you are running are not default jobs and are rather custom built. Please confirm if it is the case?
What is expected output of the job?
Are you running the production environment jobs i.e., BM as well while connected to test DB via scheduled task?
What is the status of same jobs in your production environment?","Awaiting response of the customer. If no response is received, I will set auto follow ups on 19/03/2023","I am assuming the issue was resolved after verifying the scheduled tasks and verifying if duplicate jobs were running. The customer didnt share how they actually managed to resolve the issue. It is important to mention that customer is learning to use NEA so it is entirely possible that they misconfigured some part.","Root Cause Unknown","Saqib Sharif","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.6","11.6.0.117","2.7","Closed - Resolved","Baker & McKenzie Global Services LLC","Don Boncodin","2025-03-16T15:20:42.000Z","2025-03-19T08:41:03.000Z"
