Hi Ilya,

The service account we have configured has these accesses:
-              Database owner (db_owner) database-level role
-              dbcreator server-level role

As described here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.7/page/Content/Auditor/Requirements/SQLServer.htm

The service account is an Active Directory account and using Entra Connect is also available in our EntraID environment. The database platform is Azure SQL MI (as recommended by you).

I'm not sure which authentication to use. I'm not an SQL expert... I've tried both options.

Windows authentication:

Hi Matt,

Not really...
We now switched to SQL login as that is the only thing that seems to work with Azure SQL MI. I had also attempted to contact your technical support in the meanwhile to get some help in my timezone, but we didn't get much further than attached at the moment....

We have now passed the database setup, but now the application isn't doing more than this:

Hi Yuri,



Thank you for sending this over and it is great to hear from you!



For the deployment there are two options here.



  1.  Self-service deployment inclusive of installation guidance via email should you encounter any issues.
  2.  Installation services which is a function of the professional services team, where Netwrix will install and complete the base configuration remotely via teams.



If you like I can organise a quote for the installation services though the professional services team?

Matt Harris

Hello,



While I think we are nearly there to deploy the final pieces of our 'production puzzle' (application servers, Azure SQL MI instance, gMSA account , permissions etc...) , can I in advance ask how we going to deploy the tool?



Do we need to setup a call for that?

If so, and if you do not have someone in the EMEA timezone for me and considering our timezone differences: would these timings work?

From what I see, this might be an issue with account used for installation. Please run this as admin from Domain Admin account. Ensure that there is no EPP/Antiivirus interference, exclude the installer and the following locations: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Maintenance/AntivirusExclusions.htm

Hi Matt,

 

Not really…

We now switched to SQL login as that is the only thing that seems to work with Azure SQL MI. I had also attempted to contact your technical support in the meanwhile to get some help in my timezone, but we didn’t get much further than attached at the moment….

 

We have now passed the database setup, but now the application isn’t doing more than this:

Hi Matt,

Not really...
We now switched to SQL login as that is the only thing that seems to work with Azure SQL MI. I had also attempted to contact your technical support in the meanwhile to get some help in my timezone, but we didn't get much further than attached at the moment....

We have now passed the database setup, but now the application isn't doing more than this:

Hi all,



I'm trying to configure a monitoring plan for fileservers. But configuring SQL is failing:

Any tips what may be wrong here?

Hi Yuri,



Thank you for sending this over and it is great to hear from you!



For the deployment there are two options here.



  1.  Self-service deployment inclusive of installation guidance via email should you encounter any issues.
  2.  Installation services which is a function of the professional services team, where Netwrix will install and complete the base configuration remotely via teams.



If you like I can organise a quote for the installation services though the professional services team?

Matt Harris

Hello,



While I think we are nearly there to deploy the final pieces of our 'production puzzle' (application servers, Azure SQL MI instance, gMSA account , permissions etc...) , can I in advance ask how we going to deploy the tool?



Do we need to setup a call for that?

If so, and if you do not have someone in the EMEA timezone for me and considering our timezone differences: would these timings work?

Hi Yuri,

Understood and thank you for the update on this.

Generally when we see this access violation error it is caused by a 3rd party application running on the same server.

Hi all,



I'm trying to configure a monitoring plan for fileservers. But configuring SQL is failing:

Any tips what may be wrong here?

Hi Matt,



I think the 1st option should suffice for us.

Hi Yuri,



Thank you for sending this over and it is great to hear from you!



For the deployment there are two options here.



  1.  Self-service deployment inclusive of installation guidance via email should you encounter any issues.
  2.  Installation services which is a function of the professional services team, where Netwrix will install and complete the base configuration remotely via teams.



If you like I can organise a quote for the installation services though the professional services team?

Hello,



While I think we are nearly there to deploy the final pieces of our 'production puzzle' (application servers, Azure SQL MI instance, gMSA account , permissions etc...) , can I in advance ask how we going to deploy the tool?



Do we need to setup a call for that?

If so, and if you do not have someone in the EMEA timezone for me and considering our timezone differences: would these timings work?

Hi Yuri,

Understood and thank you for the update on this.

Generally when we see this access violation error it is caused by a 3rd party application running on the same server.

Do you have any application control, MDR or EDR tools running on the same server?

Hi Matt,

Not really...
We now switched to SQL login as that is the only thing that seems to work with Azure SQL MI. I had also attempted to contact your technical support in the meanwhile to get some help in my timezone, but we didn't get much further than attached at the moment....

We have now passed the database setup, but now the application isn't doing more than this:

Hi Yuri, 

 

Understood and thank you for the update on this.

 

Generally when we see this access violation error it is caused by a 3rd party application running on the same server.

 

Do you have any application control, MDR or EDR tools running on the same server?

Hi Matt,

 

Not really…

We now switched to SQL login as that is the only thing that seems to work with Azure SQL MI. I had also attempted to contact your technical support in the meanwhile to get some help in my timezone, but we didn’t get much further than attached at the moment….

 

We have now passed the database setup, but now the application isn’t doing more than this:

Our design authority will be asking for the URL for the Netwrix web panel.

Can anyone mention how it will look like?
