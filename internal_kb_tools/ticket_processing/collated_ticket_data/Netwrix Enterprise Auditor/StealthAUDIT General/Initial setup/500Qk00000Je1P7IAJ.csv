We need assistance scoping our infrastructure in the new domain (server configuration / service accounts, etc.). Then we need assistance installing products and then configuring them for the new domain.","","Customer wants assistance with setting up NEA","Sent podlink for customer to get scheduled with NEA team.","The customer is not planning to migrate any data; he wants to create a new environment with a new DC and SQL server.
I explained to the customer that he would need to follow the new environment's guidelines to ensure proper permission is created for each server.
Since it's a new install, no migration is involved. I will close this ticket, and the customer will open a new ticket when ready to install NEA in the new server.","Guidance","Frantz Baptiste","Request","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Initial setup","11.6","","40.4","Closed - Resolved","Broadview Federal Credit Union (Formally Capital Communications Federal Credit Union (CAP COM))","Marc Payzant","2024-12-18T12:58:13.000Z","2025-01-27T23:20:10.000Z"
