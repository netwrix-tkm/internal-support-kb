Step 2: Initiate a move job to transfer the actionable files to the designated quarantine location.  
Step 3: Monitor the move job and note the number of files successfully moved versus the actionable file count.  
Step 4: Review the job logs for any errors, such as ""The system cannot find the file specified,"" and identify discrepancies between the actionable file count and the moved file count.

In some cases, the number of files moved is significantly lower than the actionable file count.
- Errors such as ""The system cannot find the file specified"" have been identified in the job logs, which may explain some of the discrepancies. However, these errors do not account for all missing files.
- The issue persists even when move jobs complete successfully, indicating that the discrepancy is not solely due to job failures or errors.
- It has been confirmed that the missing files are not present in the quarantine location, ruling out the possibility that they were moved successfully but misreported.
- A potential root cause may involve missing steps or dependencies in the job setup process, as discussed during the latest meeting.
- Logs and job data have been reviewed, and no abnormalities were found in the scan or report generation processes, suggesting the issue is isolated to the move job execution.
- A fresh scan and move job were proposed as a troubleshooting step to reset the environment and monitor for changes, but this has not yet been implemented.
- The customer plans to create a new ticket for the next host-level job to ensure proper setup and monitoring during execution.
