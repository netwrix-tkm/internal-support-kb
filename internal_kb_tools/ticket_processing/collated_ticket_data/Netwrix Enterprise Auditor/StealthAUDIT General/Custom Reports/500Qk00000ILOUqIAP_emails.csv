1) Attached are 5 screenshots in numbered order (SS01 - SS05).  The first 4 show how to make a copy of the existing Lockouts report and apply a filter for one individual for a specific time period.  Please do not try to create this report if you are unsure as to how to accomplish this after reviewing the 5 screenshots.  Let me know if you want me to send you a meeting request in order to walk through the steps instead of trying to configure this report on your own.

2) The last screenshot is for how to apply a temporary filter to an existing report and print it to a PDF file.

To summarize our meeting yesterday, we created the ""Lockouts"" and ""Lockouts_One_User"" reports using the following logic (more or less).

+++++
Steps to create and populate the AD Lockouts reports:
+++++
1) Table = SA_AD_AccountLockouts_Details (from the drop-down)

2) Filter Editor (or Edit Filter) > ""Days since Event"" ""Is less than or equal to"" 30

3) Navigate to ""Active Directory"" > Hourly > ""5.Lockouts""

Right-click and select ""Run Group""

There are other levels at which ""Run Group"" or ""Run Job"" can be executed for future reference for testing and development purposes.

Hi Craig,

Are you all set with this case?
May I close this case?

To summarize our meeting yesterday, we created the ""Lockouts"" and ""Lockouts_One_User"" reports using the following logic (more or less).

+++++
Steps to create and populate the AD Lockouts reports:
+++++
1) Table = SA_AD_AccountLockouts_Details (from the drop-down)

2) Filter Editor (or Edit Filter) > ""Days since Event"" ""Is less than or equal to"" 30

3) Navigate to ""Active Directory"" > Hourly > ""5.Lockouts""

Right-click and select ""Run Group""

There are other levels at which ""Run Group"" or ""Run Job"" can be executed for future reference for testing and development purposes. 
Your ""5.Lockouts"" and/or ""Active Directory"" job groups have scheduled actions that will be run either daily, every 3 days or weekly.
+++++

Thank you,
Mike Candon
Senior Technical Support Engineer

I think I need to have a meeting request to assist. I tried following the steps outlined in the email but I seem to be missing a step. Some of my information is different than the example and I am not sure how to get the correct screen. Also, I seem to be missing data prior to 30 days ago so I am not sure if that data is still saved somewhere or gone forever.
