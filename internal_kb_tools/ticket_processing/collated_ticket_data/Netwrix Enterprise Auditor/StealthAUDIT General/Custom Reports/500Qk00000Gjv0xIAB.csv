Report Type: Large-scale effective access report on the AIC.
Data Scope: Over 9,000 groups.

Assistance Required:
 * Clarification on whether you can run the report yourself.
   ** Or if an engineer needs to run it for you.

Action Needed:
* Provide the list of group names to be included in the report.

Cause:
AIC is not able to easily produce this type of report.
Design is more aligned with looking at a needed Group to then list what it has access to as a Review or request the object owner to update.

Resolution:
Report Template created to look at the following SQL Views that hold the needed related data.
SA_FSAA_DirectPermissionsView
SA_FSAA_PermissionsView
REF: Netwrix Enterprise Auditor v11.5 > Administration > Reporting > Creating a Report
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm

As an alternative we looked at the following TSQL query:
SELECT [DomainCanonicalName]
      ,[PrincipalId]
      ,[SamAccountName]
      ,[NTAccount]
      ,[DisplayName]
      ,[IsDeleted]
      ,[DistinguishedName]
      ,[GroupScope]
      ,[GroupTarget]
      ,[DirectMemberCount]
  FROM [StealthAUDIT].[dbo].[SA_ADInventory_GroupsView]
  WHERE [SamAccountName] LIKE  'domain%'   --For this example I get all groups that have the starting name of Domain

From this output we can then note the PrincipalId

Now we can edit the needed Report filters for this items counter part of TrusteePrincipalID
SELECT TOP (10) --[HostID]
      [HostName]
      --,[ResourceID]
      --,[ParentResourceID]
      --,[ResourceDeletedUSN]
