""File System""
""File System Actions""
""File System Reports""

1) It seems as though you may not be licensed for File System Reports in NEA but only File Activity in NAM. The report may be left over from a 2020 demo that was conducted for you?

2) In the FSAC System scan log we see the following errors:

ERROR TDCThread TDCThread.LoadSourceItf ""No DC installed to handle source : FILESYSTEMACCESS""

ERROR TDCThread TDCThread.PrepareForTask ""The 'FILESYSTEMACCESS' data collector has not been installed""

When we have potentially identified a feature or functionality issue, we should have the customer check their licensing for StealthAudit/NEA.

It is also interesting that this Report is left over from a Demo from 2020.","","I should have asked you to open StealthAudit (NEA) and navigate to ""Help"" > ""About"" and scroll down to the ""File System"" Licensed Features:
