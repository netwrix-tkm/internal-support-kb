Happy Friday!! 

It seems that some of our scanning jobs on STEALTHAudit are failing, and we do not have an email notification in place to let us know when a scanning job fails. We need to create an email alert that will let us know when a scanning job has failed. I would like to work with your Tech Support to create an email notification that will alert us when that occurs. Thank you.

Respectfully,
