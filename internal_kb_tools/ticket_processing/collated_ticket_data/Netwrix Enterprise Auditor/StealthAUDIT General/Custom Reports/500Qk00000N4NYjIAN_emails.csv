Hi Frantz.  I am including my technical team so they can provide more details if needed.

The issue is that the move file counts are smaller than the actionable file counts – in some cases, much smaller.  When this has occurred, there were no apparent errors noted on the job.

Our expectation is that the actionable file and move file have the same file counts – what is expected to move, does move.  If there are any differences, they would be at an acceptable level that is explained with errors noted, such as cannot find the file when it may have been moved between the scan and move job.

Team – is there anything I’m missing or misstating?  Are there some examples that we can send to Frantz that would help clarify the issue?

Thanks everyone!

It seems our email failed due to larger file attachment. As we are unable to see the ticket in our login, we are unable to attach files to support ticket.

@Williams, Lisa (Allianz Life Insurance Company)- Could you please share file exchange URL to upload requested data.

Hi Jean.  Did you see Mounica’s email from this morning?  I’m not sure what happened but we have not received any communication or instructions, so no, our issue is not resolved.

 

Mounica resent the requested files with her earlier email.  If there are instructions, can you please resend and copy all of us on this email.  Thank you!

Hi Jean.  I don’t think there are that many people on this account for Allianz Life.  I would say go ahead and enable it since Deepthi and Mounica are the main technical support contacts for the tool.  Do you happen to have a list of individuals on the account?

We cannot transfer tickets over to them. The only thing we can do is enable the feature so they can see the ticket. But when this feature is enabled, everyone from the contact list can see these tickets.

Or can we transfer the two open tickets that are in my name to one of them?  Would that be easier?

The Reports Host P05 behavior is normal; I found nothing wrong in the log.

Hi Mounica,
 
Thank you for the log.
I started reviewing the logs, and I don't see anything that can cause the discrepancy besides those errors.
 
The permission scan ""FSAA Scan Host P05"" has no errors; it's working as it should.
The Reports Host P05 behavior is normal; I found nothing wrong in the log.
The question is, do you still notice discrepancies in the Report?
 
If you still notice discrepancies, we can drop all data (Delete all data from the database) and start a fresh scan so that you can monitor the Report to see if anything changes.
Please reply to this email to provide an update.

Hi Jean,

As this is only the scan job which we ran on 21st April, the move job must be scheduled after we receive the confirmation from business.

Usually, in the move job, whatever the data scanned now has to be moved to our preferred locations but that is not happening from the previous 2runs (as you are aware, even the job is getting completed successfully). After the move job completion, we will get to know whether all the files moved successfully or not.


Thanks and Regards

Hi Mounica,

Do you still notice discrepancies in the Report?
If you still notice discrepancies, we can drop all data (Delete all data from the database) and start a fresh scan so that you can monitor the Report to see if anything changes.
Please reply to this email to provide an update.

Thanks,
