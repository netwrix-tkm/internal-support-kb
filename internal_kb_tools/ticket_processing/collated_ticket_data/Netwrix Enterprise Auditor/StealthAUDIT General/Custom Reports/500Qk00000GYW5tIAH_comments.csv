"00aQk000009RSeAIAW","500Qk00000GYW5tIAH","The customer is on the 11.5 version. It wasn't safe to upgrade the customer to 11.6 without the preflight meeting.
I created a new ticket for the upgrade and did a preflight meeting. 
I collected some screenshots and made a copy of the job folder and the web config file.
I advised the customer to take a snapshot of the application and the SQL server before the next meeting.
The customer already downloaded the latest version from our site
I will upgrade the customer to the 11.6 version in the next meeting.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-10-02T18:01:54.000Z","2024-10-02T18:01:54.000Z","false","false"
"00aQk000009ej4VIAQ","500Qk00000GYW5tIAH","In today's meeting, we upgraded the StealthAUDIT 11.5 to Enterprise Auditor 11.6, the AIC and Sensitive Data to the latest version of 11.6, and the Activity Monitor from 6.0.1049 to 7.1.179.
We updated the three proxy servers with the latest version.
I ensure you have access to the Publish Report and AIC.
Overall, the upgrade went well. You will continue to monitor the application to determine whether the issue with the permission scan has been resolved.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-10-14T20:06:41.000Z","2024-10-14T20:06:41.000Z","false","false"

Post Upgrade
After the upgrade, you discovered the Activity group failed with the error message ""Unable to start scan: Could not initialize scan session with any proxy host supplied.""
I reviewed the query setting for the Activity Group.
 
Under the Applet Settings, I switched it from using the ""MSTask Task Scheduler"" to ""Require applet to be running as a service on target,"" which resolved the issue with the post-upgrade.
 
The customer ran one of the Permission scan jobs, and there was no issue with that specific job.
The customer will continue to monitor the Permission scan from the original ticket and let us know if the upgrade resolves the issue with the Permission.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-10-15T19:26:13.000Z","2024-10-15T19:26:13.000Z","false","false"
