Hello Andrew,

Brief Follow up from Todays meeting.

1. Things are looking pretty healthy

2. Mondays due to weekend activity sometimes misses the schedule between the scan finishing after the import starts. This is rectified on Tuesday though and Andrew is ok as long as it continues to behave. We discussed possibly starting scans earlier or bulk imports later as a possibility to prevent it.
3.  We are going to hold this ticket and confirm that this weekend all goes well and if so will close it next week.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hi Team,

The permissions scans over the weekend went as expected. It did not hang and jobs ran successfully. This would be the second week in a row that it did this so I think it is safe to say the issue has been resolved. We will submit another case if the same symptoms present itself again.","Netwrix Support Ticket #414384 - Permission scanning errors and issues","andrew.kimx@cshs.org","Andrew Kim","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2024-11-11T18:45:35.000Z","true"
