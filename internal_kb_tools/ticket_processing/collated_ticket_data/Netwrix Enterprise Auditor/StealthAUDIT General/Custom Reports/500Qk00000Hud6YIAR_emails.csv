Would something like this work?

In the screenshot below, I'm looking for all users part of my 'Domain admins' group and then asking it to display those users and all groups they belong to.


Thank you,

Hello Johnnie,

This is the new ticket that we will be using for your report request.


To clarify, you want an Enterprise Auditor report, that checks users that belong to a specific AD group. From there, you want to know  what other groups those users are part of.

Does this sound correct to you?


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

It looks like the scheduling link didn't provide accurate times, can you do a meeting now to look into this? It should only take about 20 minutes to get setup.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Would something like this work?

In the screenshot below, I'm looking for all users part of my 'Domain admins' group and then asking it to display those users and all groups they belong to.

Hello Johnnie,

This is the new ticket that we will be using for your report request.


To clarify, you want an Enterprise Auditor report, that checks users that belong to a specific AD group. From there, you want to know  what other groups those users are part of.

Does this sound correct to you?


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

We could add another text box that shows the groups that were found in the first one and the groups that those groups are nest in. It wouldn't tell us if the groups are security or distribution though. Does that sound like what you want?

Would something like this work?

In the screenshot below, I'm looking for all users part of my 'Domain admins' group and then asking it to display those users and all groups they belong to.


Thank you,

Hello Johnnie,

This is the new ticket that we will be using for your report request.


To clarify, you want an Enterprise Auditor report, that checks users that belong to a specific AD group. From there, you want to know  what other groups those users are part of.

Does this sound correct to you?


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Johnnie,

We could add another text box that shows the groups that were found in the first one and the groups that those groups are nest in. It wouldn't tell us if the groups are security or distribution though. Does that sound like what you want?

Hi Johnnie,

It looks like the scheduling link didn't provide accurate times, can you do a meeting now to look into this? It should only take about 20 minutes to get setup.

You can get a PDF of the report emailed to you when it runs.
To do this you just navigate to the report and select > configure. On the email page you can setup who the report will be emailed to and what format it will take.

You will have to have configured an email server though in the Settings > Notification area.

Hi Johnnie,

It looks like the scheduling link didn't provide accurate times, can you do a meeting now to look into this? It should only take about 20 minutes to get setup.


Thank you,

Would something like this work?

In the screenshot below, I'm looking for all users part of my 'Domain admins' group and then asking it to display those users and all groups they belong to.

Hello Johnnie,

This is the new ticket that we will be using for your report request.


To clarify, you want an Enterprise Auditor report, that checks users that belong to a specific AD group. From there, you want to know  what other groups those users are part of.

Does this sound correct to you?


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Johnnie,

You can get a PDF of the report emailed to you when it runs.
To do this you just navigate to the report and select > configure. On the email page you can setup who the report will be emailed to and what format it will take.

You will have to have configured an email server though in the Settings > Notification area.

Thank you,

I’m ok with what we have now but one problem I’m having is there is no way to download the full report. When I click print it only prints the page that on the screen
I need to at least print the full report to pdf.

Hi Johnnie,

We could add another text box that shows the groups that were found in the first one and the groups that those groups are nest in. It wouldn't tell us if the groups are security or distribution though. Does that sound like what you want?

Thank you,

Ok,  I have one question.
Is there any chance we can list weather the group is a distro or security group?

Hello Johnnie,

This is the new ticket that we will be using for your report request.


To clarify, you want an Enterprise Auditor report, that checks users that belong to a specific AD group. From there, you want to know  what other groups those users are part of.

Does this sound correct to you?


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Johnnie,

You can get a PDF of the report emailed to you when it runs.
To do this you just navigate to the report and select > configure. On the email page you can setup who the report will be emailed to and what format it will take.

You will have to have configured an email server though in the Settings > Notification area.

Thank you,

I’m ok with what we have now but one problem I’m having is there is no way to download the full report. When I click print it only prints the page that on the screen

I need to at least print the full report to pdf.

Hi Johnnie,

We could add another text box that shows the groups that were found in the first one and the groups that those groups are nest in. It wouldn't tell us if the groups are security or distribution though. Does that sound like what you want?

Hi Johnnie,

It looks like the scheduling link didn't provide accurate times, can you do a meeting now to look into this? It should only take about 20 minutes to get setup.

Would something like this work?

In the screenshot below, I'm looking for all users part of my 'Domain admins' group and then asking it to display those users and all groups they belong to.

Hi Johnnie,

It looks like the scheduling link didn't provide accurate times, can you do a meeting now to look into this? It should only take about 20 minutes to get setup.

Hello Johnnie,

This is the new ticket that we will be using for your report request.


To clarify, you want an Enterprise Auditor report, that checks users that belong to a specific AD group. From there, you want to know  what other groups those users are part of.

Does this sound correct to you?


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Port 587 is already using TLS encryption when connecting to an SMTP server.
This looks like an auth issue. From the server that is running the NEA console, can you run the below powershell command to test connectivity to the server?

tnc -ComputerName ""smtp.gmail.com"" -Port 587

I tried gmail and even gmail doesn’t like the encryption that’s being used. 

Is there and option for TLS or SSL ?

Unfortunately we don't have the ability to set the email authentication to use OAuth 2.0.
You may need to work with your email administrator to provide an open relay or another way to authenticate to the server.

Hi Johnnie,

You can get a PDF of the report emailed to you when it runs.
To do this you just navigate to the report and select > configure. On the email page you can setup who the report will be emailed to and what format it will take.

You will have to have configured an email server though in the Settings > Notification area.

Thank you,

I’m ok with what we have now but one problem I’m having is there is no way to download the full report. When I click print it only prints the page that on the screen

I need to at least print the full report to pdf.

Hi Johnnie,

We could add another text box that shows the groups that were found in the first one and the groups that those groups are nest in. It wouldn't tell us if the groups are security or distribution though. Does that sound like what you want?

Thank you,

Is there any chance we can list weather the group is a distro or security group?

Hello Johnnie,

This is the new ticket that we will be using for your report request.


To clarify, you want an Enterprise Auditor report, that checks users that belong to a specific AD group. From there, you want to know  what other groups those users are part of.

Does this sound correct to you?


Thank you,

Hi Johnnie,

Port 587 is already using TLS encryption when connecting to an SMTP server.
This looks like an auth issue. From the server that is running the NEA console, can you run the below powershell command to test connectivity to the server?

tnc -ComputerName ""smtp.gmail.com"" -Port 587

Thank you,

I tried gmail and even gmail doesn’t like the encryption that’s being used.
Is there and option for TLS or SSL ?

Unfortunately we don't have the ability to set the email authentication to use OAuth 2.0.
You may need to work with your email administrator to provide an open relay or another way to authenticate to the server.

Hi Johnnie,

You can get a PDF of the report emailed to you when it runs.
To do this you just navigate to the report and select > configure. On the email page you can setup who the report will be emailed to and what format it will take.

You will have to have configured an email server though in the Settings > Notification area.

Thank you,

I’m ok with what we have now but one problem I’m having is there is no way to download the full report. When I click print it only prints the page that on the screen
I need to at least print the full report to pdf.

Hi Johnnie,

We could add another text box that shows the groups that were found in the first one and the groups that those groups are nest in. It wouldn't tell us if the groups are security or distribution though. Does that sound like what you want?

Thank you,

If we can't get authentication or an open relay setup, one other way you can get the report is to navigate to the report in the console and select configure.


From the configure, select widgets on the left side, then select the widget and select configure.



From the configure, enable the checkbox labeled ""Export table data as CSV"" and then hit ok.



Run the report again and when you view it, there will be an option to download the table data to a csv file that can be more easily printed.



Thank you,

Hi Johnnie,

Port 587 is already using TLS encryption when connecting to an SMTP server.
This looks like an auth issue. From the server that is running the NEA console, can you run the below powershell command to test connectivity to the server?

tnc -ComputerName ""smtp.gmail.com"" -Port 587

Thank you,

I tried gmail and even gmail doesn’t like the encryption that’s being used. 

Is there and option for TLS or SSL ?

Unfortunately we don't have the ability to set the email authentication to use OAuth 2.0.
You may need to work with your email administrator to provide an open relay or another way to authenticate to the server.

Hi Johnnie,

You can get a PDF of the report emailed to you when it runs.
To do this you just navigate to the report and select > configure. On the email page you can setup who the report will be emailed to and what format it will take.

You will have to have configured an email server though in the Settings > Notification area.

Thank you,

I’m ok with what we have now but one problem I’m having is there is no way to download the full report. When I click print it only prints the page that on the screen

I need to at least print the full report to pdf.

Hi Johnnie,

We could add another text box that shows the groups that were found in the first one and the groups that those groups are nest in. It wouldn't tell us if the groups are security or distribution though. Does that sound like what you want?

Thank you,

Hello Johnnie,

This is the new ticket that we will be using for your report request.


To clarify, you want an Enterprise Auditor report, that checks users that belong to a specific AD group. From there, you want to know  what other groups those users are part of.

Does this sound correct to you?


Thank you,

Hi Ian,

We just noticed the custom report created are report pulled from group folder access and Not their OU. Top level OU should be used.
Is there a way I can change that real quick?

I'm not sure I understand the request. The current report is supposed to look at all users in a specific group, I think we set yours up as ""Accounting"".

We don't really have a table that is specifically keeping track of the user OUs. You'd need more information about what the full DN looks like for one of these users to create the statement to generate the report.

Here is the documentation on creating custom views in NEA for the information you want.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Analysis/SQLViewCreation/Overview.htm

If you need help beyond this you would need to reach out to the professional service team to help create custom scripts as this is not something the support team can really do in depth for you.

We are having trouble figuring out how this is not something that’s not pre-configured for Soc2 financial audits.
This is the only reason we purchased this product is for audits.
If folder groups can be pulled for reports why can’t OU’s be pulled?

Hi Johnnie,

We don't really have a table that is specifically keeping track of the user OUs. You'd need more information about what the full DN looks like for one of these users to create the statement to generate the report.

Here is the documentation on creating custom views in NEA for the information you want.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Analysis/SQLViewCreation/Overview.htm

If you need help beyond this you would need to reach out to the professional service team to help create custom scripts as this is not something the support team can really do in depth for you.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

We have groups like accounting that is used for folder access then we have an accounting OU.
We need the info for the OU group we are currently getting the info from the folder access group.
Hope this makes more sense.

Hi Johnnie,

I'm not sure I understand the request. The current report is supposed to look at all users in a specific group, I think we set yours up as ""Accounting"".
It then takes all users in that group and finds all other groups those users are part of, it is not doing any specific checks on OUs.

Thank you,

Hi Ian,

We just noticed the custom report created are report pulled from group folder access and Not their OU. Top level OU should be used.

OUs are just containers inside of AD and don't really have an effect on users directly. We can find the OU of users by finding their distinguished name and work from there, but the OU structure is not something that we track in NEA directly.

Groups and users are objects and we keep detailed info on them, so they are easier to look up. Your request is something that could be configured for a report, but since OUs are not static and I don't have information on your AD environment I can't provide you the scripts you'd like to create those reports. The professional service teams with Netwrix can help you setup more customized scripts for your environment though.

Thank you,

Hi Johnnie,

OUs are just containers inside of AD and don't really have an effect on users directly. We can find the OU of users by finding their distinguished name and work from there, but the OU structure is not something that we track in NEA directly.

Groups and users are objects and we keep detailed info on them, so they are easier to look up. Your request is something that could be configured for a report, but since OUs are not static and I don't have information on your AD environment I can't provide you the scripts you'd like to create those reports. The professional service teams with Netwrix can help you setup more customized scripts for your environment though.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Thanks Ian

We are having trouble figuring out how this is not something that’s not pre-configured for Soc2 financial audits.
This is the only reason we purchased this product is for audits.
If folder groups can be pulled for reports why can’t OU’s be pulled?

Hi Johnnie,

We don't really have a table that is specifically keeping track of the user OUs. You'd need more information about what the full DN looks like for one of these users to create the statement to generate the report.

Here is the documentation on creating custom views in NEA for the information you want.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Analysis/SQLViewCreation/Overview.htm

If you need help beyond this you would need to reach out to the professional service team to help create custom scripts as this is not something the support team can really do in depth for you.

Thank you,

We have groups like accounting that is used for folder access then we have an accounting OU.
We need the info for the OU group we are currently getting the info from the folder access group.
Hope this makes more sense.

Hi Johnnie,

I'm not sure I understand the request. The current report is supposed to look at all users in a specific group, I think we set yours up as ""Accounting"".
It then takes all users in that group and finds all other groups those users are part of, it is not doing any specific checks on OUs.

Thank you,

Hi Johnnie,

OUs are just containers inside of AD and don't really have an effect on users directly. We can find the OU of users by finding their distinguished name and work from there, but the OU structure is not something that we track in NEA directly.

Groups and users are objects and we keep detailed info on them, so they are easier to look up. Your request is something that could be configured for a report, but since OUs are not static and I don't have information on your AD environment I can't provide you the scripts you'd like to create those reports. The professional service teams with Netwrix can help you setup more customized scripts for your environment though.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Thanks Ian

We are having trouble figuring out how this is not something that’s not pre-configured for Soc2 financial audits.
This is the only reason we purchased this product is for audits.
If folder groups can be pulled for reports why can’t OU’s be pulled?

Hi Johnnie,

We don't really have a table that is specifically keeping track of the user OUs. You'd need more information about what the full DN looks like for one of these users to create the statement to generate the report.

Here is the documentation on creating custom views in NEA for the information you want.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Analysis/SQLViewCreation/Overview.htm

If you need help beyond this you would need to reach out to the professional service team to help create custom scripts as this is not something the support team can really do in depth for you.

We have groups like accounting that is used for folder access then we have an accounting OU.
We need the info for the OU group we are currently getting the info from the folder access group.
Hope this makes more sense.

Hi Johnnie,

I'm not sure I understand the request. The current report is supposed to look at all users in a specific group, I think we set yours up as ""Accounting"".
It then takes all users in that group and finds all other groups those users are part of, it is not doing any specific checks on OUs.

Thank you,

Hi Ian,

We just noticed the custom report created are report pulled from group folder access and Not their OU. Top level OU should be used.
Is there a way I can change that real quick?

Hi Ian, 

 

We just noticed the custom report created are report pulled from group folder access and Not their OU. Top level OU should be used. 

Is there a way I can change that real quick?   

 

Thanks

Hi Johnnie,

OUs are just containers inside of AD and don't really have an effect on users directly. We can find the OU of users by finding their distinguished name and work from there, but the OU structure is not something that we track in NEA directly.

Groups and users are objects and we keep detailed info on them, so they are easier to look up. Your request is something that could be configured for a report, but since OUs are not static and I don't have information on your AD environment I can't provide you the scripts you'd like to create those reports. The professional service teams with Netwrix can help you setup more customized scripts for your environment though.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Thanks Ian 

 

We are having trouble figuring out how this is not something that’s not pre-configured for Soc2 financial audits. 

This is the only reason we purchased this product is for audits. 

If folder groups can be pulled for reports why can’t OU’s be pulled?

Hi Johnnie,

We don't really have a table that is specifically keeping track of the user OUs. You'd need more information about what the full DN looks like for one of these users to create the statement to generate the report.

Here is the documentation on creating custom views in NEA for the information you want.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Analysis/SQLViewCreation/Overview.htm

If you need help beyond this you would need to reach out to the professional service team to help create custom scripts as this is not something the support team can really do in depth for you.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

We have groups like accounting that is used for folder access then we have an accounting OU.

We need the info for the OU group we are currently getting the info from the folder access group. 

Hope this makes more sense.

Hi Johnnie,

I'm not sure I understand the request. The current report is supposed to look at all users in a specific group, I think we set yours up as ""Accounting"".
It then takes all users in that group and finds all other groups those users are part of, it is not doing any specific checks on OUs.

Thank you,

Hi Johnnie,

OUs are just containers inside of AD and don't really have an effect on users directly. We can find the OU of users by finding their distinguished name and work from there, but the OU structure is not something that we track in NEA directly.

Groups and users are objects and we keep detailed info on them, so they are easier to look up. Your request is something that could be configured for a report, but since OUs are not static and I don't have information on your AD environment I can't provide you the scripts you'd like to create those reports. The professional service teams with Netwrix can help you setup more customized scripts for your environment though.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Joseph,

When do you think we could have a discussion? I need to get these reports ready ASAP for a Financial SOC2 audit.

Hi Johnnie,

OUs are just containers inside of AD and don't really have an effect on users directly. We can find the OU of users by finding their distinguished name and work from there, but the OU structure is not something that we track in NEA directly.

Groups and users are objects and we keep detailed info on them, so they are easier to look up. Your request is something that could be configured for a report, but since OUs are not static and I don't have information on your AD environment I can't provide you the scripts you'd like to create those reports. The professional service teams with Netwrix can help you setup more customized scripts for your environment though.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Thank you I appreciate it. 

 

I’ll be able to pay a flat prof services fee via credit card since this is time sensitive for us.

 

Thank you for doing this.

Joseph,

 

When do you think we could have a discussion? I need to get these reports ready ASAP for a Financial SOC2 audit. 

 

Thank you for any expediency that can be put on this.
