Trying to create custom report but it is not working

Cause

Identified that the custom report was targeting the FSAC_ActivityEventsView table that would take significantly longer to query and return results versus the FSAA_ResourceView table and targeting the ResoruceID to quickly generate a new report. 

Resolution

Queried the SA_FSAA_ResourceView table using the below SQL script:

SELECT TOP (1000) [HostID]
      ,[HostName]
      ,[ID]
      ,[ParentResourceID]
      ,[Name]
      ,[Path]
      ,[ResourceType]
      ,[ResourceTypeDescription]
      ,[OwnerID]
      ,[RightsProxyID]
      ,[GatesProxyID]
      ,[NestedLevel]
      ,[Size]
      ,[LastModified]
      ,[LastAccessed]
      ,[Created]
      ,[USN]
      ,[DeletedUSN]
      ,[PermissionChange]
      ,[InheritedPermission]
      ,[DirectPermission]
  FROM [Netwrix Enterprise Auditor].[dbo].[SA_FSAA_ResourcesView]
  WHERE ResourceID =

Targeting the desired ResourceID. Alternatively, we located this ResourceID by targeting the path using the WHERE clause below:

WHERE hostID = ( HostID Number) AND Path LIKE (File Path)

Once these two pieces of information were discovered we then updated the old analysis task SQL script to include the new resourceID and changed the time parameters from @lastweek to @lastmonth within a 30 day time frame. This newly modified script provided the correct information we needed.

Additionally, we deleted an old report that was experiencing issues with exporting as a CSV and included the above script into a newly created report which successfully generated.","Advanced Configuration Change","Scottie Taylor","Question","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Custom Reports","11.6","11.6.0.115","13.0","Closed - Resolved","The Doctors Company","Chad Fontanini","2024-12-17T21:49:03.000Z","2024-12-30T22:35:21.000Z"
