I looked at the log and would like to request few more items:

	 - 	""Reports"" folder
	 - 	""Job/Group"" folder with report ""FFMDB All Extracts!""

These are required to check and see the root cause of the issue.

@Salesforce Hi Nicholas, the files he provided are what I required, but will require some more digging than I anticipated. In order to help with this can I ask for a further few things:

	 - 	Can I get a screenshot of the NEA console, showing the FMS Mercer group and all of its jobs? It would help to see how this looks, since I didn't see what I expected to see at first glance with the group folders.
	 - 	I notice that in the Repro Steps, it was noted that the Reports.xml was deleted and recreated. Could you give a bit more information on how those steps were performed?

Essentially, we are seeing an issue with the FMS Mercer group where the reports within Reports.xml are not following the correct rules, where as all of the other groups and their reports are. That's why I am trying to get as much information about how this group and its jobs.

I'll comment again with those.

So the reports.xml that lives in  %sainstalldir%ReportsReports.xml

Typically with goofy report issues in the past we would remove that Reports.xml. Then close NEA and reopen and it will recreate it.
Then we can re-publish reports. 

After doing that it still came back. So maybe we need a deepdive on that xml file to determine if we have a duplicate entry.","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-11-28T16:46:19.000Z","2024-11-28T16:46:19.000Z","false","false"

@Salesforce The issue with Reports.xml is that it's following an unsupported structure - just for the FMS Mercer group jobs - which suggests to us that something has been performed incorrectly here and hints at there somehow being multiple jobs with the same name within the group. This isn't supported via the console and is the reason why I asked for the group folder to be sent over. However, this didn't prove the theory we have, and hence why I have now asked for the screenshot of the console, in case there are any more clues there to what is going on.

I would like to see the screenshot before proceeding with a fix, to see if this gives any more clues as to how Reports.xml has gotten into this state.

However if you want to try this with the customer, the fix I would be looking to give would be the following:

	 - 	Double check that in the FMS Mercer group, there are no jobs with the same name. If there is, the rename the jobs via the NEA console.
	 - 	Delete everything in the %sainstalldir%Reports folder (Reports.xml and v3 folder)
	 - 	Run that group to regenerate the reports - don't try to publish before this.
I know this is very similar to what you have done before, but with the first check and then running the jobs instead of publishing, but this is the fix we came to with what we found in the Reports.xml.

@Salesforce Please could you have the customer perform the following steps, which should hopefully resolve the issue:

	 - 	Close all instances of NEA
	 - 	Make a backup of the Reports folder at STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITReports 
	 - 	Either rename or delete the Reports folder form the above location
	 - 	Start NEA
	 - 	Run the FMS Mercer Jobs group (do not try to publish the reports)

If this unfortunately doesn't work, please could you then send the newly generated Reports folder and the entire Jobs folder for us to debug further.

If would be also really handy for us to know if anything else has been done to the Reports.xml (aside from upgrading the application) that may have caused it to get into the state it is currently in with this group. We have noticed a mismatch in the Group name with what shows in the console and files that were sent over vs what it shows as in Reports.xml and the issue only impacts this custom group. This information would be helpful in order to make out code more robust. Thanks!
