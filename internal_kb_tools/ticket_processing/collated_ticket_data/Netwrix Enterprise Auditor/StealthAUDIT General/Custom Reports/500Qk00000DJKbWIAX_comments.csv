We created a new job and SQL ViewCreation in today's meeting.
All StealthAUDIT Tables

For the Input Source: I joined the SA_ADInventory_UsersView and SA_ADInventory_GroupMembersView

Join Columns: Table1=PrincipalId and Table2=MemberPrincipalId and the Join Type=INNER

Columns: For SA_ADInventory_GroupMembersView, I select ""GroupNTAccount
For SA_ADInventory_UsersView, I select SamAccountName and ACCOUNTDISABLE

Filter: I added this filter: [SourceTable1.ACCOUNTDISABLE] = True

Next…Next…Finish and execute the analysis

For some reason, the table did not show all domains.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-08-23T22:27:26.000Z","2024-08-23T22:27:26.000Z","false","false"
