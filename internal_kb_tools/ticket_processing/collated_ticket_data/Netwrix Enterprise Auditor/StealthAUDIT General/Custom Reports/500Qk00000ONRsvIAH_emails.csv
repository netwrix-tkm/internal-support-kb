Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. I have reviewed the previous ticket that you've referenced and I've put the resolution that was reported that worked.

1. Close all open instances of StealthAUDIT
2. Copy the JOB_1-AD_Scan folder from the archived jobs folder in %SAInstallDir%Jobs to %SAInstallDir%JobsGROUP_.Active Directory Inventory
3. Right-click and verify it's not blocked, and remove the checkbox for ""Read Only""
4. Go to Control Panel, and select ""Change"" then ""Repair"" on StealthAUDIT
5. Once the repair is complete, you should be able to see the analysis for ""SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers""


 It seems that this issue occurs when performing an upgrade and selecting the Full Upgrade option instead of the ""Upgrade in Place"" option. Do you recall performing this action during the upgrade process?

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Scottie
Thanks for those clarified instructions, I was able to get the report to appear.
It’s been many months since the upgrade so I can’t recall if that happened during the upgrade, though it was completed by a Netwrix engineer.
I think we’re set for now and this can be closed.

That's great!

I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved. The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Symptom

Same issue when we upgrade to 11.5 in case 00411545. Tried the steps from that case here, but didn't seem to correct it.

Under version 11.5 (previously 11), we had an analysis created for our AD user summary (for licensing), but it seems to have disappeared in the GUI since our upgrade to 11.6.
I see C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobsGROUP_.Active Directory InventoryJOB_1-AD_Scan<a href='https://VIEW_SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers.INI.xml' target='_blank'>VIEW_SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers.INI.xml</a> still exists in the files, but not sure how to import or recreate it in StealthAudit?

Cause

Possibly caused by a full upgrade. 

Resolution

1. Close all open instances of StealthAUDIT
2. Copy the JOB_1-AD_Scan folder from the archived jobs folder in %SAInstallDir%Jobs to %SAInstallDir%JobsGROUP_.Active Directory Inventory
3. Right-click and verify it's not blocked, and remove the checkbox for ""Read Only""
4. Go to Control Panel, and select ""Change"" then ""Repair"" on StealthAUDIT
5. Once the repair is complete, you should be able to see the analysis for ""SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers""

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor
