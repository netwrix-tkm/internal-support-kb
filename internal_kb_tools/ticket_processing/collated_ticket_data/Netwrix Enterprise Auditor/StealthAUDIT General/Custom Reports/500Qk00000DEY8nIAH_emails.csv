Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support.

As agreed on our call we can only schema docs for StealthAUDIT 11.0. I've attached them to the ticket.

If you need complete schema of the NEA 11.6 database you can use 3rd party tools like DBeaver and create ER-diagram. You can also select the specific set of tables for the ER diagram (i.e. FSAA tables, ADI tables, and so on).

I will check if we already have it documented for 11.5/11.6 and let you know.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA
