'Unexpected exception: Encountered error: Reports.xml has not been transformed at F:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsStealthAUDITReports.""


To resolve this issue, we navigated to the above directory, made a backup of reports.xml and then deleted the file from parent folder. After that we re-launched the NEA console, and we were able to view reports.","","","","005Qk00000214EvIAI","2024-12-06T04:01:25.000Z"
