Under version 11.5 (previously 11), we had an analysis created for our AD user summary (for licensing), but it seems to have disappeared in the GUI since our upgrade to 11.6. 
I see C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobsGROUP_.Active Directory InventoryJOB_1-AD_Scan<a href='https://VIEW_SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers.INI.xml' target='_blank'>VIEW_SA_ADInventoryWLGORE_LicenseUsers.INI.xml</a> still exists in the files, but not sure how to import or recreate it in StealthAudit?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-23T18:02:55.000Z"
