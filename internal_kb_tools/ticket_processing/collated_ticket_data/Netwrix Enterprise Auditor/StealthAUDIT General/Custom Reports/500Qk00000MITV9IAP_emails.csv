Did we ever get clarification of if we can use wildcards for the Sensitive Data exclusions?

Hello John,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Identified two views that provide the desired data for the Passwords report. This includes the OpenShares_SDDDetails and the FS_SharesRanked_SDD views. We then modified the current report to display 2 rows including both of these views. This will display two sets of information from both views in one report.

Our next steps are:

You will:

Generate the report with the updated modifications and provide the results of the report.

I will:

Keep this ticket open to allow for report generation and review of the data that's populated in the report.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi John,

Thank you for the updated information. I'd like to schedule a meeting to possibly set up a custom report targeting a couple alternative table options. If at that point we still run into performance issues with the report I have the referral completed and ready to send to professional services.

I donâ€™t see the File Path column in that table.

Hello John,

I'm currently creating the referral to professional services but I was also able to find a possible alternative table that can possibly be used to gain the desired columns data without having to query the entire Matches View table. Can you try selecting the SA_FSDLP_Criteria table and utilizing the Criteria ID. This table should also have the shares within the file path column.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi John,

Thank you for the updated information. That will have to be referred to professional services so that a custom SQL script can be created to join those two tables into one with the desired columns referenced.

Would you like for me to refer you to our professional services team?

I am able to have the report emailed to me via CSV. Its 13MB with about 1,000,000 lines.

I am only interested in Password hits on open shares. So is there a way to cut down on the results by creating a report where we match the DLP Hits to the Open Shares in the FS_OpenAcess table views?

Is this something we can work on or would it require professional services?

Hi John,

Thank you for the updated information. The configuration seems to be fine. I'm not completely sure why the console is crashing when you attempt to view the report other than a possibility of a large amount of data displaying. Are you able to view the exported report when the report generation is complete?

Additionally, can you provide the application log when you attempt to access the report in console? The file path for the log is below:

Program Files (x86)StealthAuditSADatabaseLogsApplication

Thank you,
