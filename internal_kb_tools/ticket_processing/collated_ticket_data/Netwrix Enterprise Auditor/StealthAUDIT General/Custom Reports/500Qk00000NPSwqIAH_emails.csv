Hi Ian,

We would need to launch files share review and hope to utilize reports from the Resource Audit. Ideally, we would need reports in .csv format that included the timestamp when reports were generated, SAM account name and file share path for each account. This information was available in the Netwrix Auditor which was decommissioned but not in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor export.  Please see the snippet below of how Netwrix Auditor report looked like that we are trying to replicate.

Do you have FSAA scanning configured in your environment already?
The AIC console can show you permissions that a user has to resources that have been scanned. It doesn't quite look the same but it does allow anyone with access to the web interface to view permissions on users.

Yes, FSAA scanning is configured. We were planning to use reports from AIC/ reporting module that meet the format and criteria that we need for audit purposes so we could them within our internal review process.

Configuring AIC so reviewers can login to do the reviews within Netwrix platform is an option but might require additional work and pre-configuration that we hope could at this time.

Yes, we need to replicate the report as close to snippet I sent as possible. Please share the instructions when you get a chance.

Hello Zinoviy,

Can you tell me what the custom report requires, does it need to look exactly the same as the image of the Auditor report you had sent previously?
I may be able to help to some degree, but the support team is not allowed to create custom reports unfortunately.
I can provide documentation on creating custom reports but if you need assistance our professional services team would have to be engaged and there is an additional charge for their services.

Thank you,

Yes, FSAA scanning is configured. We were planning to use reports from AIC/ reporting module that meet the format and criteria that we need for audit purposes so we could them within our internal review process.



 



Configuring AIC so reviewers can login to do the reviews within Netwrix platform is an option but might require additional work and pre-configuration that we hope could at this time.

Hi Zino,

Do you have FSAA scanning configured in your environment already?
The AIC console can show you permissions that a user has to resources that have been scanned. It doesn't quite look the same but it does allow anyone with access to the web interface to view permissions on users.

Thank you,

Hi Ian,

 

We would need to launch files share review and hope to utilize reports from the Resource Audit. Ideally, we would need reports in .csv format that included the timestamp when reports were generated, SAM account name and file share path for each account. This information was available in the Netwrix Auditor which was decommissioned but not in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor export.  Please see the snippet below of how Netwrix Auditor report looked like that we are trying to replicate.

Hi Ian,

Could you please share some time slots for next week for a remote session: I do not have access to the report config console to create custom reports. Last time our admin was trying to set me up with the access it locked out console access for the admin role.

To be audit ready we would need to add SAM account name, UNC path of the shared folder and timestamp on each line.

Hello Zinoviy,

Can you tell me what the custom report requires, does it need to look exactly the same as the image of the Auditor report you had sent previously?
I may be able to help to some degree, but the support team is not allowed to create custom reports unfortunately.
I can provide documentation on creating custom reports but if you need assistance our professional services team would have to be engaged and there is an additional charge for their services.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Yes, FSAA scanning is configured. We were planning to use reports from AIC/ reporting module that meet the format and criteria that we need for audit purposes so we could them within our internal review process.

Configuring AIC so reviewers can login to do the reviews within Netwrix platform is an option but might require additional work and pre-configuration that we hope could at this time.

Hi Zino,

Do you have FSAA scanning configured in your environment already?
The AIC console can show you permissions that a user has to resources that have been scanned. It doesn't quite look the same but it does allow anyone with access to the web interface to view permissions on users.

Thank you,

Hi Ian,

We would need to launch files share review and hope to utilize reports from the Resource Audit. Ideally, we would need reports in .csv format that included the timestamp when reports were generated, SAM account name and file share path for each account. This information was available in the Netwrix Auditor which was decommissioned but not in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor export.  Please see the snippet below of how Netwrix Auditor report looked like that we are trying to replicate.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Discussed how to provide access to users in the NEA console.
I explained that the permissions set become the absolute list and you must make sure admins are added as it will lock out all other users not listed in the access list.
We discussed the difference between the Access Information Center and the reporting console and how their behavior and permissions are separated.

I also provided the link with documentation on how to user the SQLViewCreation to assist in joining tables together.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Analysis/SQLViewCreation/Overview.htm

As discussed, I will keep this ticket open until the 8th in case you run into any more questions that I can help with. Otherwise if I have not heard back at that time I will proceed with closing the ticket.

If you do have any other questions please feel free to reach out and I'd be happy to assist.

Hi Ian,

 

Could you please share some time slots for next week for a remote session: I do not have access to the report config console to create custom reports. Last time our admin was trying to set me up with the access it locked out console access for the admin role.

Hi Ian,

 

To be audit ready we would need to add SAM account name, UNC path of the shared folder and timestamp on each line.

Hello Zinoviy,

Can you tell me what the custom report requires, does it need to look exactly the same as the image of the Auditor report you had sent previously?
I may be able to help to some degree, but the support team is not allowed to create custom reports unfortunately.
I can provide documentation on creating custom reports but if you need assistance our professional services team would have to be engaged and there is an additional charge for their services.

Thank you,

Yes, FSAA scanning is configured. We were planning to use reports from AIC/ reporting module that meet the format and criteria that we need for audit purposes so we could them within our internal review process.



 



Configuring AIC so reviewers can login to do the reviews within Netwrix platform is an option but might require additional work and pre-configuration that we hope could at this time.

Hi Zino,

Do you have FSAA scanning configured in your environment already?
The AIC console can show you permissions that a user has to resources that have been scanned. It doesn't quite look the same but it does allow anyone with access to the web interface to view permissions on users.

Thank you,

Hi Ian,

 

We would need to launch files share review and hope to utilize reports from the Resource Audit. Ideally, we would need reports in .csv format that included the timestamp when reports were generated, SAM account name and file share path for each account. This information was available in the Netwrix Auditor which was decommissioned but not in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor export.  Please see the snippet below of how Netwrix Auditor report looked like that we are trying to replicate.

Hello Zinoviy,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Discussed how to provide access to users in the NEA console.
I explained that the permissions set become the absolute list and you must make sure admins are added as it will lock out all other users not listed in the access list.
We discussed the difference between the Access Information Center and the reporting console and how their behavior and permissions are separated.

I also provided the link with documentation on how to user the SQLViewCreation to assist in joining tables together.

As discussed, I will keep this ticket open until the 8th in case you run into any more questions that I can help with. Otherwise if I have not heard back at that time I will proceed with closing the ticket.

If you do have any other questions please feel free to reach out and I'd be happy to assist.

Hello Zinoviy,

Can you tell me what the custom report requires, does it need to look exactly the same as the image of the Auditor report you had sent previously?
I may be able to help to some degree, but the support team is not allowed to create custom reports unfortunately.
I can provide documentation on creating custom reports but if you need assistance our professional services team would have to be engaged and there is an additional charge for their services.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Yes, FSAA scanning is configured. We were planning to use reports from AIC/ reporting module that meet the format and criteria that we need for audit purposes so we could them within our internal review process.



Configuring AIC so reviewers can login to do the reviews within Netwrix platform is an option but might require additional work and pre-configuration that we hope could at this time.

Hi Zino,

Do you have FSAA scanning configured in your environment already?
The AIC console can show you permissions that a user has to resources that have been scanned. It doesn't quite look the same but it does allow anyone with access to the web interface to view permissions on users.

Thank you,

Hi Ian,



We would need to launch files share review and hope to utilize reports from the Resource Audit. Ideally, we would need reports in .csv format that included the timestamp when reports were generated, SAM account name and file share path for each account. This information was available in the Netwrix Auditor which was decommissioned but not in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor export.  Please see the snippet below of how Netwrix Auditor report looked like that we are trying to replicate.

Hello Zinoviy,

Here is the details on how to create a custom report and how to use the wizard.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/Report/Create.htm#Create

This document details the tables that the FSAA collector uses and what data is in each one that you can use for your custom reports.

Yes, we need to replicate the report as close to snippet I sent as possible. Please share the instructions when you get a chance.



 



Thank you,

Hello Zinoviy,

Can you tell me what the custom report requires, does it need to look exactly the same as the image of the Auditor report you had sent previously?
I may be able to help to some degree, but the support team is not allowed to create custom reports unfortunately.
I can provide documentation on creating custom reports but if you need assistance our professional services team would have to be engaged and there is an additional charge for their services.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Yes, FSAA scanning is configured. We were planning to use reports from AIC/ reporting module that meet the format and criteria that we need for audit purposes so we could them within our internal review process.



 



Configuring AIC so reviewers can login to do the reviews within Netwrix platform is an option but might require additional work and pre-configuration that we hope could at this time.

Hi Zino,

Do you have FSAA scanning configured in your environment already?
The AIC console can show you permissions that a user has to resources that have been scanned. It doesn't quite look the same but it does allow anyone with access to the web interface to view permissions on users.

Thank you,

Hi Ian,

 

We would need to launch files share review and hope to utilize reports from the Resource Audit. Ideally, we would need reports in .csv format that included the timestamp when reports were generated, SAM account name and file share path for each account. This information was available in the Netwrix Auditor which was decommissioned but not in the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor export.  Please see the snippet below of how Netwrix Auditor report looked like that we are trying to replicate.

 



 

 

Regards,

Zino
