What would be the easiest way to identify where these permissions are missing?

Answered questions revolving around optimal ways to track permission changes as well as monitor when permission changes took place. Determined that multiple reports would need to be created to target the different change types for email automation. I suggested using the NAM console to get a more reactionary result of the permission changes.","0054u000007MdqrAAC","2024-08-05T21:46:18.000Z","2024-08-05T21:46:18.000Z","false","false"
