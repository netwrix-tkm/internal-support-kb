"500Qk00000NPSwqIAH","00440265","Support Ticket","Shared folders review - reports config","I would like to get a direction on how to better perform File share review using Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. In the past we used reports from the Netwrix Auditor that included Object and the account information (CN) in .csv format on each line CN seems to be replaced with the user's display name in the AIC report of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. Is there a way to add these fields to the report?","NA - Custom report reqest","--------

On the call with the customer I explained how access works in NEA and why all other users were locked out. I also provided the documentation for the SQLViewCreation. Customer asked for the ticket to remain open for a few days to ensure they have no other questions and approved closure on the 8th if no communication is received from them.

The customer appears to want a report that mirrors the Netwrix Auditor report, they already have FSAA scans running and have the AIC installed, but it seems they don't want to fully use the AIC for their reporting.","Awaiting closure.","Issue:
We would like information on creating custom reports and granting access restrictions to the NEA console.


Resolution:
We covered the NEA access restrictions and how they apply to the console and reporting console as well.
Documentation was provided for creating custom reports and the SQLViewCreation tool.
