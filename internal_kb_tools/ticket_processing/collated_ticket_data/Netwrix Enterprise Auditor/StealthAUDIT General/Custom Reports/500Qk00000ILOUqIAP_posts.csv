1) Table = SA_AD_AccountLockouts_Details

2) Filter Editor (or Edit Filter) > ""Days since Event"" ""Is less than or equal to"" 30

3) ""Active Directory"" > Hourly > ""5.Lockouts""

Right-click and select ""Run Group""

There are other levels at which ""Run Group"" or ""Run Job"" can be executed for future reference for testing and development purposes. 
Your ""5.Lockouts"" and/or ""Active Directory"" job groups have scheduled actions that will be run either daily, every 3 days or weekly.
