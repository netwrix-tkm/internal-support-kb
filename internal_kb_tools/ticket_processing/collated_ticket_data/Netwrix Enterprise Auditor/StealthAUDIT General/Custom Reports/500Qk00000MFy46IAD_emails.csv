Today we:

We found that the effective access seems to only show effective access to file shares, and the permissions tab only shows direct permissions instead of permissions being granted by groups.

Hi Ian –

 

Yes, Sure can.  John Wyatt for example is in many AD security groups but yet, no folder permissions show up in the AIC when I search for them.  He should have numerous showing.  Its like that for other users also.  I was just thinking a lot more should permissions should be reflecting.   I am attaching an example of a person who has been here with us a long time. Epstein is the user.

 

Maybe the scan did not run correctly?

Hello Kevin,

Can you give me an example of what you're seeing when you try and get a user's permissions?

As for the triangle, it means there is an exception somewhere in the directory, usually something like a disabled user being assigned permissions or something along those lines.

Thank you,

Thank you, Ian.  It was a good call.  

 

I have been looking over things over in AIC and I noticed that the shared folder permissions are not populating when I search a list of users.  Only the older users we searched on the call.  Was thinking maybe the scan did not fully work over the weekend.  

 

I also noticed the red triangle with exclamation.  Do you know what that indicates?

Hello Kevin,



 



This looks like a modified structure and FSAA may have been removed or moved.
Lets do a zoom call to look into this and we can restore the jobs if needed as well. Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting.

Hi Brandon –

 

Thank you for the feedback.  Looking over your response.    I logged onto the server in addition to viewing the AIC. Nothing shows in the AIC so I assume that is due to 1-FSAA not being setup?  Do you have documentation on how to set it up?

 

On the server it does not even show as listed.  See second image below.

Hello Kevin,

I'm glad to hear the FSAC scan completed successfully. it is important to note this job only collects file system events from activity monitor.  It is necessary to run FSAC Bulk Import to bring the results into the MSSQL database.

FSAC also does not collect permission data.  This is performed by 1-FSAA_System_Scans and to accompanying FSAA Bulk Import.

The page you are viewing is the Web Reports view of Enterprise Auditor - served by default on tcp/8082.

the access information center can be access by either selecting the Access tab at the top of this page, which provides limited administrative functionality but is sufficient for most security analyst needs.

The AIC can also be access on it's dedicated port, default is HTTP tcp/81 or HTTPS tcp/481 - HTTPS requires additional configuration.

Thank you,

Hi Ian –

 

Thank you so much for the documentation steps.   I have verified step 1 the scan is running.  Although it is named 1-FSAC System Scans for us.  It ran 20 hours ago.  

 

After verifying the scan is running, I then proceeded to step 2 in which I logged into the AIC.   Here is where there is difference.  My home page looks like this (see below).    I do not have the tile options you have in Netwrix homepage.  Resource Audit is not available to select.  Even when searching for it.   Any thoughts?   We are using StealthBits  Version 11.5

 

I think the resource audit would prove useful if we can get it to show up.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From our call you are looking for information on file shares and user access.
To get this information, first you will need to make sure the FSAA scan is running and succeeding as seen in the screenshot below.



After the scan and bulk import jobs both run. You should be able to open the Access Information Center page (default port 8082)
From the AIC, you will navigate to resource audit.




From resource audit you will have the ability to expand the ""File Share"" node, and see all file servers that have been scanned. You can expand these file servers to find their shares and when selected, from the right panel, you can see the permissions on these individual folders, you can also drill down and see sub folder permissions as well.




If you would like to create a custom report inside Enterprise Auditor, you can use the report creation wizard detailed in the documentation below.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm

If you have any questions on any of this or need any help, please let me know and I would be happy to assist.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hi Ian –

Yes, Sure can.  John Wyatt for example is in many AD security groups but yet, no folder permissions show up in the AIC when I search for them.  He should have numerous showing.  Its like that for other users also.  I was just thinking a lot more should permissions should be reflecting.   I am attaching an example of a person who has been here with us a long time. Epstein is the user.

Maybe the scan did not run correctly?

Hello Kevin,

Can you give me an example of what you're seeing when you try and get a user's permissions?

As for the triangle, it means there is an exception somewhere in the directory, usually something like a disabled user being assigned permissions or something along those lines.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Thank you, Ian.  It was a good call.

I have been looking over things over in AIC and I noticed that the shared folder permissions are not populating when I search a list of users.  Only the older users we searched on the call.  Was thinking maybe the scan did not fully work over the weekend.

I also noticed the red triangle with exclamation.  Do you know what that indicates?

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Setup your FSAA scanning to make sure scans were being taken of all file system servers.
We also got you admin access to the AIC so you could see the reports you need and export the CSV for them.

As discussed, here is the link with the recording to the meeting.

Hello Kevin,

This looks like a modified structure and FSAA may have been removed or moved.
Lets do a zoom call to look into this and we can restore the jobs if needed as well. Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting.

Hi Brandon –

Thank you for the feedback.  Looking over your response.    I logged onto the server in addition to viewing the AIC. Nothing shows in the AIC so I assume that is due to 1-FSAA not being setup?  Do you have documentation on how to set it up?

On the server it does not even show as listed.  See second image below.

Hello Kevin,

I'm glad to hear the FSAC scan completed successfully. it is important to note this job only collects file system events from activity monitor.  It is necessary to run FSAC Bulk Import to bring the results into the MSSQL database.

FSAC also does not collect permission data.  This is performed by 1-FSAA_System_Scans and to accompanying FSAA Bulk Import.

The page you are viewing is the Web Reports view of Enterprise Auditor - served by default on tcp/8082.

the access information center can be access by either selecting the Access tab at the top of this page, which provides limited administrative functionality but is sufficient for most security analyst needs.

The AIC can also be access on it's dedicated port, default is HTTP tcp/81 or HTTPS tcp/481 - HTTPS requires additional configuration.

Thank you,

Hi Ian –

Thank you so much for the documentation steps.   I have verified step 1 the scan is running.  Although it is named 1-FSAC System Scans for us.  It ran 20 hours ago.

After verifying the scan is running, I then proceeded to step 2 in which I logged into the AIC.   Here is where there is difference.  My home page looks like this (see below).    I do not have the tile options you have in Netwrix homepage.  Resource Audit is not available to select.  Even when searching for it.   Any thoughts?   We are using StealthBits  Version 11.5

I think the resource audit would prove useful if we can get it to show up.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From our call you are looking for information on file shares and user access.
To get this information, first you will need to make sure the FSAA scan is running and succeeding as seen in the screenshot below.

[cid:image008.png@01DB9262.D860BB70]

After the scan and bulk import jobs both run. You should be able to open the Access Information Center page (default port 8082)
From the AIC, you will navigate to resource audit.

[cid:image009.png@01DB9262.D860BB70]


From resource audit you will have the ability to expand the ""File Share"" node, and see all file servers that have been scanned. You can expand these file servers to find their shares and when selected, from the right panel, you can see the permissions on these individual folders, you can also drill down and see sub folder permissions as well.

[cid:image010.png@01DB9262.D860BB70]


If you would like to create a custom report inside Enterprise Auditor, you can use the report creation wizard detailed in the documentation below.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__helpcenter.netwrix.com_bundle_StealthAUDIT-5F11.5_page_Content_StealthAUDIT_Chapters_09.Reporting_Creating-5Fa-5FReport.htm&d=DwQCaQ&c=RMnmm6VPZn6InKz70COhA6ljkuRx8qD28wOQIYh-aEY&r=GiuBQrnleKLC82Z4IkwkMKAJt2prLdNwZZrkLeiXkvc&m=T0b7lrESnfNCMWAnBBvjYm-KqgX2d-La8HYQSvwdgmqAt0RX0Ccb5Ew6EIDBr4BN&s=p7_uJaUXVW86Bq2bff08wIFN_2QH3a4my25fnY8Z16c&e=>

Hello Kevin,

I have done some digging and there doesn't seem to be a way to get all of the folders and sub folder permissions for individual users in AIC.
I will see how difficult it would be to get a custom report built that will do this for you though and let you know how we can proceed forward.

Thank you,

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified the data was correct in your tables and that the scans were running.
We looked into the shares to see if we could find a reason for the info displaying as it was.
We found that the effective access seems to only show effective access to file shares, and the permissions tab only shows direct permissions instead of permissions being granted by groups.

I was able to talk to some of our internal team, but the person I needed was not in this morning.
I will follow up with you on this issue to get you an answer as soon as I can.

Our next steps are:
I will:
Investigate the issue internally and try to provide a workaround to see all files/folders that a user has access to.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hi Ian –

 

Yes, Sure can.  John Wyatt for example is in many AD security groups but yet, no folder permissions show up in the AIC when I search for them.  He should have numerous showing.  Its like that for other users also.  I was just thinking a lot more should permissions should be reflecting.   I am attaching an example of a person who has been here with us a long time. Epstein is the user.

 

Maybe the scan did not run correctly?

Hello Kevin,

Can you give me an example of what you're seeing when you try and get a user's permissions?

As for the triangle, it means there is an exception somewhere in the directory, usually something like a disabled user being assigned permissions or something along those lines.

Thank you,

Thank you, Ian.  It was a good call.  

 

I have been looking over things over in AIC and I noticed that the shared folder permissions are not populating when I search a list of users.  Only the older users we searched on the call.  Was thinking maybe the scan did not fully work over the weekend.  

 

I also noticed the red triangle with exclamation.  Do you know what that indicates?

Hello Kevin,



 



This looks like a modified structure and FSAA may have been removed or moved.
Lets do a zoom call to look into this and we can restore the jobs if needed as well. Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting.

Hi Brandon –

 

Thank you for the feedback.  Looking over your response.    I logged onto the server in addition to viewing the AIC. Nothing shows in the AIC so I assume that is due to 1-FSAA not being setup?  Do you have documentation on how to set it up?

 

On the server it does not even show as listed.  See second image below.

Hello Kevin,

I'm glad to hear the FSAC scan completed successfully. it is important to note this job only collects file system events from activity monitor.  It is necessary to run FSAC Bulk Import to bring the results into the MSSQL database.

FSAC also does not collect permission data.  This is performed by 1-FSAA_System_Scans and to accompanying FSAA Bulk Import.

The page you are viewing is the Web Reports view of Enterprise Auditor - served by default on tcp/8082.

the access information center can be access by either selecting the Access tab at the top of this page, which provides limited administrative functionality but is sufficient for most security analyst needs.

The AIC can also be access on it's dedicated port, default is HTTP tcp/81 or HTTPS tcp/481 - HTTPS requires additional configuration.

Thank you,

Hi Ian –

 

Thank you so much for the documentation steps.   I have verified step 1 the scan is running.  Although it is named 1-FSAC System Scans for us.  It ran 20 hours ago.  

 

After verifying the scan is running, I then proceeded to step 2 in which I logged into the AIC.   Here is where there is difference.  My home page looks like this (see below).    I do not have the tile options you have in Netwrix homepage.  Resource Audit is not available to select.  Even when searching for it.   Any thoughts?   We are using StealthBits  Version 11.5

 

I think the resource audit would prove useful if we can get it to show up.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From our call you are looking for information on file shares and user access.
To get this information, first you will need to make sure the FSAA scan is running and succeeding as seen in the screenshot below.



After the scan and bulk import jobs both run. You should be able to open the Access Information Center page (default port 8082)
From the AIC, you will navigate to resource audit.




From resource audit you will have the ability to expand the ""File Share"" node, and see all file servers that have been scanned. You can expand these file servers to find their shares and when selected, from the right panel, you can see the permissions on these individual folders, you can also drill down and see sub folder permissions as well.




If you would like to create a custom report inside Enterprise Auditor, you can use the report creation wizard detailed in the documentation below.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm

If you have any questions on any of this or need any help, please let me know and I would be happy to assist.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello Kevin,

I have done some digging and there doesn't seem to be a way to get all of the folders and sub folder permissions for individual users in AIC.
I will see how difficult it would be to get a custom report built that will do this for you though and let you know how we can proceed forward.

Hi Ian –

Yes, Sure can.  John Wyatt for example is in many AD security groups but yet, no folder permissions show up in the AIC when I search for them.  He should have numerous showing.  Its like that for other users also.  I was just thinking a lot more should permissions should be reflecting.   I am attaching an example of a person who has been here with us a long time. Epstein is the user.

Maybe the scan did not run correctly?

Hello Kevin,

Can you give me an example of what you're seeing when you try and get a user's permissions?

As for the triangle, it means there is an exception somewhere in the directory, usually something like a disabled user being assigned permissions or something along those lines.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Thank you, Ian.  It was a good call.

I have been looking over things over in AIC and I noticed that the shared folder permissions are not populating when I search a list of users.  Only the older users we searched on the call.  Was thinking maybe the scan did not fully work over the weekend.

I also noticed the red triangle with exclamation.  Do you know what that indicates?

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Setup your FSAA scanning to make sure scans were being taken of all file system servers.
We also got you admin access to the AIC so you could see the reports you need and export the CSV for them.

As discussed, here is the link with the recording to the meeting.

Hello Kevin,

This looks like a modified structure and FSAA may have been removed or moved.
Lets do a zoom call to look into this and we can restore the jobs if needed as well. Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting.

Hi Brandon –

Thank you for the feedback.  Looking over your response.    I logged onto the server in addition to viewing the AIC. Nothing shows in the AIC so I assume that is due to 1-FSAA not being setup?  Do you have documentation on how to set it up?

On the server it does not even show as listed.  See second image below.

Hello Kevin,

I'm glad to hear the FSAC scan completed successfully. it is important to note this job only collects file system events from activity monitor.  It is necessary to run FSAC Bulk Import to bring the results into the MSSQL database.

FSAC also does not collect permission data.  This is performed by 1-FSAA_System_Scans and to accompanying FSAA Bulk Import.

The page you are viewing is the Web Reports view of Enterprise Auditor - served by default on tcp/8082.

the access information center can be access by either selecting the Access tab at the top of this page, which provides limited administrative functionality but is sufficient for most security analyst needs.

The AIC can also be access on it's dedicated port, default is HTTP tcp/81 or HTTPS tcp/481 - HTTPS requires additional configuration.

Thank you,

Brandon West

Hi Ian –

Thank you so much for the documentation steps.   I have verified step 1 the scan is running.  Although it is named 1-FSAC System Scans for us.  It ran 20 hours ago.

After verifying the scan is running, I then proceeded to step 2 in which I logged into the AIC.   Here is where there is difference.  My home page looks like this (see below).    I do not have the tile options you have in Netwrix homepage.  Resource Audit is not available to select.  Even when searching for it.   Any thoughts?   We are using StealthBits  Version 11.5

I think the resource audit would prove useful if we can get it to show up.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From our call you are looking for information on file shares and user access.
To get this information, first you will need to make sure the FSAA scan is running and succeeding as seen in the screenshot below.

[cid:image008.png@01DB926D.3D288D80]

After the scan and bulk import jobs both run. You should be able to open the Access Information Center page (default port 8082)
From the AIC, you will navigate to resource audit.

[cid:image009.png@01DB926D.3D288D80]


From resource audit you will have the ability to expand the ""File Share"" node, and see all file servers that have been scanned. You can expand these file servers to find their shares and when selected, from the right panel, you can see the permissions on these individual folders, you can also drill down and see sub folder permissions as well.

[cid:image010.png@01DB926D.3D288D80]


If you would like to create a custom report inside Enterprise Auditor, you can use the report creation wizard detailed in the documentation below.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__helpcenter.netwrix.com_bundle_StealthAUDIT-5F11.5_page_Content_StealthAUDIT_Chapters_09.Reporting_Creating-5Fa-5FReport.htm&d=DwQCaQ&c=RMnmm6VPZn6InKz70COhA6ljkuRx8qD28wOQIYh-aEY&r=GiuBQrnleKLC82Z4IkwkMKAJt2prLdNwZZrkLeiXkvc&m=T0b7lrESnfNCMWAnBBvjYm-KqgX2d-La8HYQSvwdgmqAt0RX0Ccb5Ew6EIDBr4BN&s=p7_uJaUXVW86Bq2bff08wIFN_2QH3a4my25fnY8Z16c&e=>

I apologize for the delayed response. I have looked into this and this request would require some comparing of multiple tables to present the view you're looking for.
This isn't something I can do unfortunately and would require professional services to be engaged, however the pro serve engagement would be an extra cost.

I can provide you a list of all tables and what data they store and you can try put the queries together yourself. I also have the option of opening an enhancement request to try and get this infromation added in a future version. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I can help move forward on this.

Every folder, sub folder, and file a user has access to on a network drive we check would be best.

Hello Kevin,

I have done some digging and there doesn't seem to be a way to get all of the folders and sub folder permissions for individual users in AIC.
I will see how difficult it would be to get a custom report built that will do this for you though and let you know how we can proceed forward.

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified the data was correct in your tables and that the scans were running.
We looked into the shares to see if we could find a reason for the info displaying as it was.
We found that the effective access seems to only show effective access to file shares, and the permissions tab only shows direct permissions instead of permissions being granted by groups.

I was able to talk to some of our internal team, but the person I needed was not in this morning.
I will follow up with you on this issue to get you an answer as soon as I can.

Our next steps are:
I will:
Investigate the issue internally and try to provide a workaround to see all files/folders that a user has access to.





Thank you,

Hi Ian –

 

Yes, Sure can.  John Wyatt for example is in many AD security groups but yet, no folder permissions show up in the AIC when I search for them.  He should have numerous showing.  Its like that for other users also.  I was just thinking a lot more should permissions should be reflecting.   I am attaching an example of a person who has been here with us a long time. Epstein is the user.

 

Maybe the scan did not run correctly?

Hello Kevin,

Can you give me an example of what you're seeing when you try and get a user's permissions?

As for the triangle, it means there is an exception somewhere in the directory, usually something like a disabled user being assigned permissions or something along those lines.

Thank you,

Thank you, Ian.  It was a good call.  

 

I have been looking over things over in AIC and I noticed that the shared folder permissions are not populating when I search a list of users.  Only the older users we searched on the call.  Was thinking maybe the scan did not fully work over the weekend.  

 

I also noticed the red triangle with exclamation.  Do you know what that indicates?

Hello Kevin,



 



This looks like a modified structure and FSAA may have been removed or moved.
Lets do a zoom call to look into this and we can restore the jobs if needed as well. Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting.

Hi Brandon –

 

Thank you for the feedback.  Looking over your response.    I logged onto the server in addition to viewing the AIC. Nothing shows in the AIC so I assume that is due to 1-FSAA not being setup?  Do you have documentation on how to set it up?

 

On the server it does not even show as listed.  See second image below.

Hello Kevin,

I'm glad to hear the FSAC scan completed successfully. it is important to note this job only collects file system events from activity monitor.  It is necessary to run FSAC Bulk Import to bring the results into the MSSQL database.

FSAC also does not collect permission data.  This is performed by 1-FSAA_System_Scans and to accompanying FSAA Bulk Import.

The page you are viewing is the Web Reports view of Enterprise Auditor - served by default on tcp/8082.

the access information center can be access by either selecting the Access tab at the top of this page, which provides limited administrative functionality but is sufficient for most security analyst needs.

The AIC can also be access on it's dedicated port, default is HTTP tcp/81 or HTTPS tcp/481 - HTTPS requires additional configuration.

Thank you,

Hi Ian –

 

Thank you so much for the documentation steps.   I have verified step 1 the scan is running.  Although it is named 1-FSAC System Scans for us.  It ran 20 hours ago.  

 

After verifying the scan is running, I then proceeded to step 2 in which I logged into the AIC.   Here is where there is difference.  My home page looks like this (see below).    I do not have the tile options you have in Netwrix homepage.  Resource Audit is not available to select.  Even when searching for it.   Any thoughts?   We are using StealthBits  Version 11.5

 

I think the resource audit would prove useful if we can get it to show up.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From our call you are looking for information on file shares and user access.
To get this information, first you will need to make sure the FSAA scan is running and succeeding as seen in the screenshot below.



After the scan and bulk import jobs both run. You should be able to open the Access Information Center page (default port 8082)
From the AIC, you will navigate to resource audit.




From resource audit you will have the ability to expand the ""File Share"" node, and see all file servers that have been scanned. You can expand these file servers to find their shares and when selected, from the right panel, you can see the permissions on these individual folders, you can also drill down and see sub folder permissions as well.




If you would like to create a custom report inside Enterprise Auditor, you can use the report creation wizard detailed in the documentation below.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm

If you have any questions on any of this or need any help, please let me know and I would be happy to assist.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello Kevin,

I have done some digging and there doesn't seem to be a way to get all of the folders and sub folder permissions for individual users in AIC.
I will see how difficult it would be to get a custom report built that will do this for you though and let you know how we can proceed forward.

Hi Ian –

Yes, Sure can.  John Wyatt for example is in many AD security groups but yet, no folder permissions show up in the AIC when I search for them.  He should have numerous showing.  Its like that for other users also.  I was just thinking a lot more should permissions should be reflecting.   I am attaching an example of a person who has been here with us a long time. Epstein is the user.

Maybe the scan did not run correctly?

Hello Kevin,

Can you give me an example of what you're seeing when you try and get a user's permissions?

As for the triangle, it means there is an exception somewhere in the directory, usually something like a disabled user being assigned permissions or something along those lines.

Thank you,

Thank you, Ian.  It was a good call.

I have been looking over things over in AIC and I noticed that the shared folder permissions are not populating when I search a list of users.  Only the older users we searched on the call.  Was thinking maybe the scan did not fully work over the weekend.

I also noticed the red triangle with exclamation.  Do you know what that indicates?

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Setup your FSAA scanning to make sure scans were being taken of all file system servers.
We also got you admin access to the AIC so you could see the reports you need and export the CSV for them.

As discussed, here is the link with the recording to the meeting.

Hello Kevin,

This looks like a modified structure and FSAA may have been removed or moved.
Lets do a zoom call to look into this and we can restore the jobs if needed as well. Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting.

Hi Brandon –

Thank you for the feedback.  Looking over your response.    I logged onto the server in addition to viewing the AIC. Nothing shows in the AIC so I assume that is due to 1-FSAA not being setup?  Do you have documentation on how to set it up?

On the server it does not even show as listed.  See second image below.

Hello Kevin,

I'm glad to hear the FSAC scan completed successfully. it is important to note this job only collects file system events from activity monitor.  It is necessary to run FSAC Bulk Import to bring the results into the MSSQL database.

FSAC also does not collect permission data.  This is performed by 1-FSAA_System_Scans and to accompanying FSAA Bulk Import.

The page you are viewing is the Web Reports view of Enterprise Auditor - served by default on tcp/8082.

the access information center can be access by either selecting the Access tab at the top of this page, which provides limited administrative functionality but is sufficient for most security analyst needs.

The AIC can also be access on it's dedicated port, default is HTTP tcp/81 or HTTPS tcp/481 - HTTPS requires additional configuration.

Thank you,

Hi Ian –

Thank you so much for the documentation steps.   I have verified step 1 the scan is running.  Although it is named 1-FSAC System Scans for us.  It ran 20 hours ago.

After verifying the scan is running, I then proceeded to step 2 in which I logged into the AIC.   Here is where there is difference.  My home page looks like this (see below).    I do not have the tile options you have in Netwrix homepage.  Resource Audit is not available to select.  Even when searching for it.   Any thoughts?   We are using StealthBits  Version 11.5

I think the resource audit would prove useful if we can get it to show up.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From our call you are looking for information on file shares and user access.
To get this information, first you will need to make sure the FSAA scan is running and succeeding as seen in the screenshot below.

[cid:image009.png@01DB9CC6.217ED720]

After the scan and bulk import jobs both run. You should be able to open the Access Information Center page (default port 8082)
From the AIC, you will navigate to resource audit.

[cid:image010.png@01DB9CC6.217ED720]


From resource audit you will have the ability to expand the ""File Share"" node, and see all file servers that have been scanned. You can expand these file servers to find their shares and when selected, from the right panel, you can see the permissions on these individual folders, you can also drill down and see sub folder permissions as well.

[cid:image011.png@01DB9CC6.217ED720]


If you would like to create a custom report inside Enterprise Auditor, you can use the report creation wizard detailed in the documentation below.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__helpcenter.netwrix.com_bundle_StealthAUDIT-5F11.5_page_Content_StealthAUDIT_Chapters_09.Reporting_Creating-5Fa-5FReport.htm&d=DwQCaQ&c=RMnmm6VPZn6InKz70COhA6ljkuRx8qD28wOQIYh-aEY&r=GiuBQrnleKLC82Z4IkwkMKAJt2prLdNwZZrkLeiXkvc&m=T0b7lrESnfNCMWAnBBvjYm-KqgX2d-La8HYQSvwdgmqAt0RX0Ccb5Ew6EIDBr4BN&s=p7_uJaUXVW86Bq2bff08wIFN_2QH3a4my25fnY8Z16c&e=>

I have looked into this and this request would require some comparing of multiple tables to present the view you're looking for.
This isn't something I can do unfortunately and would require professional services to be engaged, however the pro serve engagement would be an extra cost.

I can provide you a list of all tables and what data they store and you can try put the queries together yourself. I also have the option of opening an enhancement request to try and get this information added in a future version. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I can help move forward on this.

Hello Kevin,

I have done some digging and there doesn't seem to be a way to get all of the folders and sub folder permissions for individual users in AIC.
I will see how difficult it would be to get a custom report built that will do this for you though and let you know how we can proceed forward.

Thank you,

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified the data was correct in your tables and that the scans were running.
We looked into the shares to see if we could find a reason for the info displaying as it was.
We found that the effective access seems to only show effective access to file shares, and the permissions tab only shows direct permissions instead of permissions being granted by groups.

I was able to talk to some of our internal team, but the person I needed was not in this morning.
I will follow up with you on this issue to get you an answer as soon as I can.

Our next steps are:
I will:
Investigate the issue internally and try to provide a workaround to see all files/folders that a user has access to.





Thank you,

Hi Ian –

 

Yes, Sure can.  John Wyatt for example is in many AD security groups but yet, no folder permissions show up in the AIC when I search for them.  He should have numerous showing.  Its like that for other users also.  I was just thinking a lot more should permissions should be reflecting.   I am attaching an example of a person who has been here with us a long time. Epstein is the user.

 

Maybe the scan did not run correctly?

Hello Kevin,

Can you give me an example of what you're seeing when you try and get a user's permissions?

As for the triangle, it means there is an exception somewhere in the directory, usually something like a disabled user being assigned permissions or something along those lines.

Thank you,

Thank you, Ian.  It was a good call.  

 

I have been looking over things over in AIC and I noticed that the shared folder permissions are not populating when I search a list of users.  Only the older users we searched on the call.  Was thinking maybe the scan did not fully work over the weekend.  

 

I also noticed the red triangle with exclamation.  Do you know what that indicates?

Hello Kevin,



 



This looks like a modified structure and FSAA may have been removed or moved.
Lets do a zoom call to look into this and we can restore the jobs if needed as well. Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting.

Hi Brandon –

 

Thank you for the feedback.  Looking over your response.    I logged onto the server in addition to viewing the AIC. Nothing shows in the AIC so I assume that is due to 1-FSAA not being setup?  Do you have documentation on how to set it up?

 

On the server it does not even show as listed.  See second image below.

Hello Kevin,

I'm glad to hear the FSAC scan completed successfully. it is important to note this job only collects file system events from activity monitor.  It is necessary to run FSAC Bulk Import to bring the results into the MSSQL database.

FSAC also does not collect permission data.  This is performed by 1-FSAA_System_Scans and to accompanying FSAA Bulk Import.

The page you are viewing is the Web Reports view of Enterprise Auditor - served by default on tcp/8082.

the access information center can be access by either selecting the Access tab at the top of this page, which provides limited administrative functionality but is sufficient for most security analyst needs.

The AIC can also be access on it's dedicated port, default is HTTP tcp/81 or HTTPS tcp/481 - HTTPS requires additional configuration.

Thank you,

Hi Ian –

 

Thank you so much for the documentation steps.   I have verified step 1 the scan is running.  Although it is named 1-FSAC System Scans for us.  It ran 20 hours ago.  

 

After verifying the scan is running, I then proceeded to step 2 in which I logged into the AIC.   Here is where there is difference.  My home page looks like this (see below).    I do not have the tile options you have in Netwrix homepage.  Resource Audit is not available to select.  Even when searching for it.   Any thoughts?   We are using StealthBits  Version 11.5

 

I think the resource audit would prove useful if we can get it to show up.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From our call you are looking for information on file shares and user access.
To get this information, first you will need to make sure the FSAA scan is running and succeeding as seen in the screenshot below.



After the scan and bulk import jobs both run. You should be able to open the Access Information Center page (default port 8082)
From the AIC, you will navigate to resource audit.




From resource audit you will have the ability to expand the ""File Share"" node, and see all file servers that have been scanned. You can expand these file servers to find their shares and when selected, from the right panel, you can see the permissions on these individual folders, you can also drill down and see sub folder permissions as well.




If you would like to create a custom report inside Enterprise Auditor, you can use the report creation wizard detailed in the documentation below.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm

If you have any questions on any of this or need any help, please let me know and I would be happy to assist.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hi Ian,

Please disregard my latest email as I have been out all last week on vacation.   Catching up on my email.

Thank you for your response.

Yes, If you could provide me with the data tables I can see if I can figure it out.   If not do you know the cost of having your other team help us?  Is it hourly or one price for all?  Whom do I contact for that.


Thank you Ian.

Hello Kevin,

I apologize for the delayed response. I have looked into this and this request would require some comparing of multiple tables to present the view you're looking for.
This isn't something I can do unfortunately and would require professional services to be engaged, however the pro serve engagement would be an extra cost.

I can provide you a list of all tables and what data they store and you can try put the queries together yourself. I also have the option of opening an enhancement request to try and get this infromation added in a future version. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I can help move forward on this.

Thank you,

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified the data was correct in your tables and that the scans were running.
We looked into the shares to see if we could find a reason for the info displaying as it was.
We found that the effective access seems to only show effective access to file shares, and the permissions tab only shows direct permissions instead of permissions being granted by groups.

I was able to talk to some of our internal team, but the person I needed was not in this morning.
I will follow up with you on this issue to get you an answer as soon as I can.

Our next steps are:
I will:
Investigate the issue internally and try to provide a workaround to see all files/folders that a user has access to.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hi Ian –

Yes, Sure can.  John Wyatt for example is in many AD security groups but yet, no folder permissions show up in the AIC when I search for them.  He should have numerous showing.  Its like that for other users also.  I was just thinking a lot more should permissions should be reflecting.   I am attaching an example of a person who has been here with us a long time. Epstein is the user.

Maybe the scan did not run correctly?

Hello Kevin,

Can you give me an example of what you're seeing when you try and get a user's permissions?

As for the triangle, it means there is an exception somewhere in the directory, usually something like a disabled user being assigned permissions or something along those lines.

Thank you,

Thank you, Ian.  It was a good call.

I have been looking over things over in AIC and I noticed that the shared folder permissions are not populating when I search a list of users.  Only the older users we searched on the call.  Was thinking maybe the scan did not fully work over the weekend.

I also noticed the red triangle with exclamation.  Do you know what that indicates?

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Setup your FSAA scanning to make sure scans were being taken of all file system servers.
We also got you admin access to the AIC so you could see the reports you need and export the CSV for them.

As discussed, here is the link with the recording to the meeting.

Hello Kevin,

This looks like a modified structure and FSAA may have been removed or moved.
Lets do a zoom call to look into this and we can restore the jobs if needed as well. Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting.

Hi Brandon –

Thank you for the feedback.  Looking over your response.    I logged onto the server in addition to viewing the AIC. Nothing shows in the AIC so I assume that is due to 1-FSAA not being setup?  Do you have documentation on how to set it up?

On the server it does not even show as listed.  See second image below.

Hello Kevin,

I'm glad to hear the FSAC scan completed successfully. it is important to note this job only collects file system events from activity monitor.  It is necessary to run FSAC Bulk Import to bring the results into the MSSQL database.

FSAC also does not collect permission data.  This is performed by 1-FSAA_System_Scans and to accompanying FSAA Bulk Import.

The page you are viewing is the Web Reports view of Enterprise Auditor - served by default on tcp/8082.

the access information center can be access by either selecting the Access tab at the top of this page, which provides limited administrative functionality but is sufficient for most security analyst needs.

The AIC can also be access on it's dedicated port, default is HTTP tcp/81 or HTTPS tcp/481 - HTTPS requires additional configuration.

Thank you,

Hi Ian –

Thank you so much for the documentation steps.   I have verified step 1 the scan is running.  Although it is named 1-FSAC System Scans for us.  It ran 20 hours ago.

After verifying the scan is running, I then proceeded to step 2 in which I logged into the AIC.   Here is where there is difference.  My home page looks like this (see below).    I do not have the tile options you have in Netwrix homepage.  Resource Audit is not available to select.  Even when searching for it.   Any thoughts?   We are using StealthBits  Version 11.5

I think the resource audit would prove useful if we can get it to show up.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From our call you are looking for information on file shares and user access.
To get this information, first you will need to make sure the FSAA scan is running and succeeding as seen in the screenshot below.

[cid:image009.png@01DB9CC7.FB8405C0]

After the scan and bulk import jobs both run. You should be able to open the Access Information Center page (default port 8082)
From the AIC, you will navigate to resource audit.

[cid:image010.png@01DB9CC7.FB8405C0]


From resource audit you will have the ability to expand the ""File Share"" node, and see all file servers that have been scanned. You can expand these file servers to find their shares and when selected, from the right panel, you can see the permissions on these individual folders, you can also drill down and see sub folder permissions as well.

[cid:image011.png@01DB9CC7.FB8405C0]


If you would like to create a custom report inside Enterprise Auditor, you can use the report creation wizard detailed in the documentation below.

Below is a document that details all tables relating to the permissions jobs.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/StandardTables.htm

As for the professional services team, I don't know their pricing unfortunately. Normally they would scope out the project for you and let you know what their price and billing would be on that once they determine what the job would require.

Thank you,

Hi Ian,  

 

Please disregard my latest email as I have been out all last week on vacation.   Catching up on my email.      

 

Thank you for your response. 

 

Yes, If you could provide me with the data tables I can see if I can figure it out.   If not do you know the cost of having your other team help us?  Is it hourly or one price for all?  Whom do I contact for that.  

 

 

Thank you Ian.

Hello Kevin,

I apologize for the delayed response. I have looked into this and this request would require some comparing of multiple tables to present the view you're looking for.
This isn't something I can do unfortunately and would require professional services to be engaged, however the pro serve engagement would be an extra cost.

I can provide you a list of all tables and what data they store and you can try put the queries together yourself. I also have the option of opening an enhancement request to try and get this infromation added in a future version. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I can help move forward on this.

Thank you,

Hi Ian –

 

Every folder, sub folder, and file a user has access to on a network drive we check would be best.

To clarify for myself, you want to see every folder, sub folder, and file a user has access to or did you want some limit to the details?

Hello Kevin,

I have done some digging and there doesn't seem to be a way to get all of the folders and sub folder permissions for individual users in AIC.
I will see how difficult it would be to get a custom report built that will do this for you though and let you know how we can proceed forward.

Thank you,

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified the data was correct in your tables and that the scans were running.
We looked into the shares to see if we could find a reason for the info displaying as it was.
We found that the effective access seems to only show effective access to file shares, and the permissions tab only shows direct permissions instead of permissions being granted by groups.

I was able to talk to some of our internal team, but the person I needed was not in this morning.
I will follow up with you on this issue to get you an answer as soon as I can.

Our next steps are:
I will:
Investigate the issue internally and try to provide a workaround to see all files/folders that a user has access to.





Thank you,

Hi Ian –

 

Yes, Sure can.  John Wyatt for example is in many AD security groups but yet, no folder permissions show up in the AIC when I search for them.  He should have numerous showing.  Its like that for other users also.  I was just thinking a lot more should permissions should be reflecting.   I am attaching an example of a person who has been here with us a long time. Epstein is the user.

 

Maybe the scan did not run correctly?

Hello Kevin,

Can you give me an example of what you're seeing when you try and get a user's permissions?

As for the triangle, it means there is an exception somewhere in the directory, usually something like a disabled user being assigned permissions or something along those lines.

Thank you,

Thank you, Ian.  It was a good call.  

 

I have been looking over things over in AIC and I noticed that the shared folder permissions are not populating when I search a list of users.  Only the older users we searched on the call.  Was thinking maybe the scan did not fully work over the weekend.  

 

I also noticed the red triangle with exclamation.  Do you know what that indicates?

Hello Kevin,



 



This looks like a modified structure and FSAA may have been removed or moved.
Lets do a zoom call to look into this and we can restore the jobs if needed as well. Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting.

Hi Brandon –

 

Thank you for the feedback.  Looking over your response.    I logged onto the server in addition to viewing the AIC. Nothing shows in the AIC so I assume that is due to 1-FSAA not being setup?  Do you have documentation on how to set it up?

 

On the server it does not even show as listed.  See second image below.

Hello Kevin,

I'm glad to hear the FSAC scan completed successfully. it is important to note this job only collects file system events from activity monitor.  It is necessary to run FSAC Bulk Import to bring the results into the MSSQL database.

FSAC also does not collect permission data.  This is performed by 1-FSAA_System_Scans and to accompanying FSAA Bulk Import.

The page you are viewing is the Web Reports view of Enterprise Auditor - served by default on tcp/8082.

the access information center can be access by either selecting the Access tab at the top of this page, which provides limited administrative functionality but is sufficient for most security analyst needs.

The AIC can also be access on it's dedicated port, default is HTTP tcp/81 or HTTPS tcp/481 - HTTPS requires additional configuration.

Thank you,

Hi Ian –

 

Thank you so much for the documentation steps.   I have verified step 1 the scan is running.  Although it is named 1-FSAC System Scans for us.  It ran 20 hours ago.  

 

After verifying the scan is running, I then proceeded to step 2 in which I logged into the AIC.   Here is where there is difference.  My home page looks like this (see below).    I do not have the tile options you have in Netwrix homepage.  Resource Audit is not available to select.  Even when searching for it.   Any thoughts?   We are using StealthBits  Version 11.5

 

I think the resource audit would prove useful if we can get it to show up.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From our call you are looking for information on file shares and user access.
To get this information, first you will need to make sure the FSAA scan is running and succeeding as seen in the screenshot below.



After the scan and bulk import jobs both run. You should be able to open the Access Information Center page (default port 8082)
From the AIC, you will navigate to resource audit.




From resource audit you will have the ability to expand the ""File Share"" node, and see all file servers that have been scanned. You can expand these file servers to find their shares and when selected, from the right panel, you can see the permissions on these individual folders, you can also drill down and see sub folder permissions as well.




If you would like to create a custom report inside Enterprise Auditor, you can use the report creation wizard detailed in the documentation below.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm

If you have any questions on any of this or need any help, please let me know and I would be happy to assist.

Thank you,

Hello Kevin,

Below is a document that details all tables relating to the permissions jobs.

As for the professional services team, I don't know their pricing unfortunately. Normally they would scope out the project for you and let you know what their price and billing would be on that once they determine what the job would require.

Thank you,

Hi Ian,

Please disregard my latest email as I have been out all last week on vacation.   Catching up on my email.

Thank you for your response.

Yes, If you could provide me with the data tables I can see if I can figure it out.   If not do you know the cost of having your other team help us?  Is it hourly or one price for all?  Whom do I contact for that.


Thank you Ian.

Hello Kevin,

I apologize for the delayed response. I have looked into this and this request would require some comparing of multiple tables to present the view you're looking for.
This isn't something I can do unfortunately and would require professional services to be engaged, however the pro serve engagement would be an extra cost.

I can provide you a list of all tables and what data they store and you can try put the queries together yourself. I also have the option of opening an enhancement request to try and get this infromation added in a future version. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I can help move forward on this.

Thank you,

Every folder, sub folder, and file a user has access to on a network drive we check would be best.

To clarify for myself, you want to see every folder, sub folder, and file a user has access to or did you want some limit to the details?

Hello Kevin,

I have done some digging and there doesn't seem to be a way to get all of the folders and sub folder permissions for individual users in AIC.
I will see how difficult it would be to get a custom report built that will do this for you though and let you know how we can proceed forward.

Thank you,

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified the data was correct in your tables and that the scans were running.
We looked into the shares to see if we could find a reason for the info displaying as it was.
We found that the effective access seems to only show effective access to file shares, and the permissions tab only shows direct permissions instead of permissions being granted by groups.

I was able to talk to some of our internal team, but the person I needed was not in this morning.
I will follow up with you on this issue to get you an answer as soon as I can.

Our next steps are:
I will:
Investigate the issue internally and try to provide a workaround to see all files/folders that a user has access to.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hi Ian –

Yes, Sure can.  John Wyatt for example is in many AD security groups but yet, no folder permissions show up in the AIC when I search for them.  He should have numerous showing.  Its like that for other users also.  I was just thinking a lot more should permissions should be reflecting.   I am attaching an example of a person who has been here with us a long time. Epstein is the user.

Maybe the scan did not run correctly?

Hello Kevin,

Can you give me an example of what you're seeing when you try and get a user's permissions?

As for the triangle, it means there is an exception somewhere in the directory, usually something like a disabled user being assigned permissions or something along those lines.

Thank you,

Thank you, Ian.  It was a good call.

I have been looking over things over in AIC and I noticed that the shared folder permissions are not populating when I search a list of users.  Only the older users we searched on the call.  Was thinking maybe the scan did not fully work over the weekend.

I also noticed the red triangle with exclamation.  Do you know what that indicates?

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Setup your FSAA scanning to make sure scans were being taken of all file system servers.
We also got you admin access to the AIC so you could see the reports you need and export the CSV for them.

Hello Kevin,

This looks like a modified structure and FSAA may have been removed or moved.
Lets do a zoom call to look into this and we can restore the jobs if needed as well. Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting.

Hi Brandon –

Thank you for the feedback.  Looking over your response.    I logged onto the server in addition to viewing the AIC. Nothing shows in the AIC so I assume that is due to 1-FSAA not being setup?  Do you have documentation on how to set it up?

On the server it does not even show as listed.  See second image below.

Hello Kevin,

I'm glad to hear the FSAC scan completed successfully. it is important to note this job only collects file system events from activity monitor.  It is necessary to run FSAC Bulk Import to bring the results into the MSSQL database.

FSAC also does not collect permission data.  This is performed by 1-FSAA_System_Scans and to accompanying FSAA Bulk Import.

The page you are viewing is the Web Reports view of Enterprise Auditor - served by default on tcp/8082.

the access information center can be access by either selecting the Access tab at the top of this page, which provides limited administrative functionality but is sufficient for most security analyst needs.

The AIC can also be access on it's dedicated port, default is HTTP tcp/81 or HTTPS tcp/481 - HTTPS requires additional configuration.

Thank you,

Hi Ian –

Thank you so much for the documentation steps.   I have verified step 1 the scan is running.  Although it is named 1-FSAC System Scans for us.  It ran 20 hours ago.

After verifying the scan is running, I then proceeded to step 2 in which I logged into the AIC.   Here is where there is difference.  My home page looks like this (see below).    I do not have the tile options you have in Netwrix homepage.  Resource Audit is not available to select.  Even when searching for it.   Any thoughts?   We are using StealthBits  Version 11.5

I think the resource audit would prove useful if we can get it to show up.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From our call you are looking for information on file shares and user access.
To get this information, first you will need to make sure the FSAA scan is running and succeeding as seen in the screenshot below.

[cid:image009.png@01DB9CD8.FD86A3D0]

After the scan and bulk import jobs both run. You should be able to open the Access Information Center page (default port 8082)
From the AIC, you will navigate to resource audit.

[cid:image010.png@01DB9CD8.FD86A3D0]


From resource audit you will have the ability to expand the ""File Share"" node, and see all file servers that have been scanned. You can expand these file servers to find their shares and when selected, from the right panel, you can see the permissions on these individual folders, you can also drill down and see sub folder permissions as well.

[cid:image011.png@01DB9CD8.FD86A3D0]


If you would like to create a custom report inside Enterprise Auditor, you can use the report creation wizard detailed in the documentation below.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm<https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__helpcenter.netwrix.com_bundle_StealthAUDIT-5F11.5_page_Content_StealthAUDIT_Chapters_09.Reporting_Creating-5Fa-5FReport.htm&d=DwQCaQ&c=RMnmm6VPZn6InKz70COhA6ljkuRx8qD28wOQIYh-aEY&r=GiuBQrnleKLC82Z4IkwkMKAJt2prLdNwZZrkLeiXkvc&m=T0b7lrESnfNCMWAnBBvjYm-KqgX2d-La8HYQSvwdgmqAt0RX0Ccb5Ew6EIDBr4BN&s=p7_uJaUXVW86Bq2bff08wIFN_2QH3a4my25fnY8Z16c&e=>

Hello Kevin,

Below is a document that details all tables relating to the permissions jobs.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/FSAA/StandardTables.htm

As for the professional services team, I don't know their pricing unfortunately. Normally they would scope out the project for you and let you know what their price and billing would be on that once they determine what the job would require.

Hi Ian,  

 

Please disregard my latest email as I have been out all last week on vacation.   Catching up on my email.      

 

Thank you for your response. 

 

Yes, If you could provide me with the data tables I can see if I can figure it out.   If not do you know the cost of having your other team help us?  Is it hourly or one price for all?  Whom do I contact for that.  

 

 

Thank you Ian.

Hello Kevin,

I apologize for the delayed response. I have looked into this and this request would require some comparing of multiple tables to present the view you're looking for.
This isn't something I can do unfortunately and would require professional services to be engaged, however the pro serve engagement would be an extra cost.

I can provide you a list of all tables and what data they store and you can try put the queries together yourself. I also have the option of opening an enhancement request to try and get this infromation added in a future version. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I can help move forward on this.

Thank you,

Hello Kevin,

I have done some digging and there doesn't seem to be a way to get all of the folders and sub folder permissions for individual users in AIC.
I will see how difficult it would be to get a custom report built that will do this for you though and let you know how we can proceed forward.

Hello Kevin,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified the data was correct in your tables and that the scans were running.
We looked into the shares to see if we could find a reason for the info displaying as it was.
We found that the effective access seems to only show effective access to file shares, and the permissions tab only shows direct permissions instead of permissions being granted by groups.

I was able to talk to some of our internal team, but the person I needed was not in this morning.
I will follow up with you on this issue to get you an answer as soon as I can.

Our next steps are:
I will:
Investigate the issue internally and try to provide a workaround to see all files/folders that a user has access to.

Hi Ian –

 

Yes, Sure can.  John Wyatt for example is in many AD security groups but yet, no folder permissions show up in the AIC when I search for them.  He should have numerous showing.  Its like that for other users also.  I was just thinking a lot more should permissions should be reflecting.   I am attaching an example of a person who has been here with us a long time. Epstein is the user.

 

Maybe the scan did not run correctly?

Hello Kevin,

Can you give me an example of what you're seeing when you try and get a user's permissions?

As for the triangle, it means there is an exception somewhere in the directory, usually something like a disabled user being assigned permissions or something along those lines.

I have been looking over things over in AIC and I noticed that the shared folder permissions are not populating when I search a list of users.  Only the older users we searched on the call.  Was thinking maybe the scan did not fully work over the weekend.  

 

I also noticed the red triangle with exclamation.  Do you know what that indicates?

Hello Kevin,



 



This looks like a modified structure and FSAA may have been removed or moved.
Lets do a zoom call to look into this and we can restore the jobs if needed as well. Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting.

Hi Brandon –

 

Thank you for the feedback.  Looking over your response.    I logged onto the server in addition to viewing the AIC. Nothing shows in the AIC so I assume that is due to 1-FSAA not being setup?  Do you have documentation on how to set it up?

 

On the server it does not even show as listed.  See second image below.

Thank you for your assistance.

Hello Kevin,

I'm glad to hear the FSAC scan completed successfully. it is important to note this job only collects file system events from activity monitor.  It is necessary to run FSAC Bulk Import to bring the results into the MSSQL database.

FSAC also does not collect permission data.  This is performed by 1-FSAA_System_Scans and to accompanying FSAA Bulk Import.

The page you are viewing is the Web Reports view of Enterprise Auditor - served by default on tcp/8082.

the access information center can be access by either selecting the Access tab at the top of this page, which provides limited administrative functionality but is sufficient for most security analyst needs.

The AIC can also be access on it's dedicated port, default is HTTP tcp/81 or HTTPS tcp/481 - HTTPS requires additional configuration.

Thank you,

Brandon West

Hi Ian –

 

Thank you so much for the documentation steps.   I have verified step 1 the scan is running.  Although it is named 1-FSAC System Scans for us.  It ran 20 hours ago.  

 

After verifying the scan is running, I then proceeded to step 2 in which I logged into the AIC.   Here is where there is difference.  My home page looks like this (see below).    I do not have the tile options you have in Netwrix homepage.  Resource Audit is not available to select.  Even when searching for it.   Any thoughts?   We are using StealthBits  Version 11.5

 

I think the resource audit would prove useful if we can get it to show up.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From our call you are looking for information on file shares and user access.
To get this information, first you will need to make sure the FSAA scan is running and succeeding as seen in the screenshot below.



After the scan and bulk import jobs both run. You should be able to open the Access Information Center page (default port 8082)
From the AIC, you will navigate to resource audit.




From resource audit you will have the ability to expand the ""File Share"" node, and see all file servers that have been scanned. You can expand these file servers to find their shares and when selected, from the right panel, you can see the permissions on these individual folders, you can also drill down and see sub folder permissions as well.




If you would like to create a custom report inside Enterprise Auditor, you can use the report creation wizard detailed in the documentation below.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm

If you have any questions on any of this or need any help, please let me know and I would be happy to assist.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer
