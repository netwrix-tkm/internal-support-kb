I apologize for the delay in responding as I needed to clarify a few things before suggesting the best option for you.

We can provide you with a query to identify which shares haven't been scanned for a certain number of days. If this query returns results, you'll need another query to delete these entries since your ultimate goal is to clean up the database. This will then become a task for professional services as we'll need to create custom queries for this process.

I believe the most effective option is to delete all data related to the specific host in question and rerun FSAA scans to gather fresh data. You can refer to this article for instructions on how to remove data from the database for the host you're concerned with.

We highly recommend you take a backup/snapshot of your DB and Application server prior performing above task.


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Hey Pasan

Thanks for the link, I am familiar with that process.

To answer your statement about identifying shares that haven't neem scanned for a number of days, if you recall I don't want to identify shares that haven't been scanned but rather I want to identify sub-folders that haven't been scanned for a number of days.

Is that possible?

Hi Mark,

I apologize for the delay in responding as I needed to clarify a few things before suggesting the best option for you.

We can provide you with a query to identify which shares haven't been scanned for a certain number of days. If this query returns results, you'll need another query to delete these entries since your ultimate goal is to clean up the database. This will then become a task for professional services as we'll need to create custom queries for this process.

I believe the most effective option is to delete all data related to the specific host in question and rerun FSAA scans to gather fresh data. You can refer to this  article for instructions on how to remove data from the database for the host you're concerned with.

We highly recommend you take a backup/snapshot of your DB and Application server prior performing above task.


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Hi Mark,

That will be possible, but you'll still have to go through professional services for such request as it will be treated as custom work.

Hey Pasan

Thanks for the link, I am familiar with that process.

To answer your statement about identifying shares that haven't neem scanned for a number of days, if you recall I don't want to identify shares that haven't been scanned but rather I want to identify sub-folders that haven't been scanned for a number of days.

Is that possible?

Regards

Hi Mark,

I apologize for the delay in responding as I needed to clarify a few things before suggesting the best option for you.

We can provide you with a query to identify which shares haven't been scanned for a certain number of days. If this query returns results, you'll need another query to delete these entries since your ultimate goal is to clean up the database. This will then become a task for professional services as we'll need to create custom queries for this process.

I believe the most effective option is to delete all data related to the specific host in question and rerun FSAA scans to gather fresh data. You can refer to this article<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA0Qk0000001qvpKAA.html> for instructions on how to remove data from the database for the host you're concerned with.

We highly recommend you take a backup/snapshot of your DB and Application server prior performing above task.


Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Hi Mark,

As discussed during our meeting, you would like to see if we can run a report or perform query to identify shares/folders that are not been scanned for certain period of time.

Please allow me few days to test this in my lab and get back to you with a solution.
