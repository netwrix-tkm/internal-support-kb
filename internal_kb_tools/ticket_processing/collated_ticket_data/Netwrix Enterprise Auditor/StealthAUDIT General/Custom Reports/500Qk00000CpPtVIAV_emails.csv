I have been reviewing the Critical ticket logged for your StealthAUDIT report issue.

As I understand there is an issue with a custom job running, however you are unfamiliar with this job.

As this is Critical it is important you have a clear definition of what the issue is so we can progress this.

It is pertinent we understand who created the custom job so we can work with that relevant team. Without this progress will be very difficult to reverse engineer the custom work.

Please provide examples of what is not working, screenshots of the relevant jobs, clear examples of any data discrepencies.

Following this you can use the following link to schedule a meeting with me. I currently have time available in 90minutes from now which can be selected in this link:

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=DWICQIBzT1pz0BMopwRqhg3BMnbITxocGgeROsN5l_s-Z&MeetingID=hw4Mu7qdka3guQOt7Uav1evs.4uh_JLpBgQ4M8CaW_k-Z

In line with our support agreement for a Critical level ticket can you provide examples of:
The software being unavailable/inaccessible.
Server downtime, performance degradations or failure of business Critical system related to StealthAUDIT.

Following up on this as I had not had a response on the Critical item:
I have been reviewing the Critical ticket logged for your StealthAUDIT report issue.

As I understand there is an issue with a custom job running, however you are unfamiliar with this job.

As this is Critical it is important you have a clear definition of what the issue is so we can progress this.

It is pertinent we understand who created the custom job so we can work with that relevant team. Without this progress will be very difficult to reverse engineer the custom work.

Please provide examples of what is not working, screenshots of the relevant jobs, clear examples of any data discrepencies.

Following this you can use the following link to schedule a meeting with me.

I did not see any meetings scheduled today, please review following days for the Critical meeting.

In line with our support agreement for a Critical level ticket can you provide examples of:
The software being unavailable/inaccessible.
Server downtime, performance degradations or failure of business Critical system related to StealthAUDIT.

Hello Alex,

Issue  : Dls are not updating after complete all jobs.

We have verified on SQL server. By using running individual quires we are getting expected results. But when we check in Exchange we do see discrepancies.
We have observed few errors in AD_Contact listing job .Please find below screenshot.

We had 2 hours call with your team and they suggested to grab job details and share. I have attached .zip files in ticket.
Please consider this issue on priority. As its updating co-operate communication DLs.

Hello Alex,

 

Issue  : Dls are not updating after complete all jobs. 

 

We have verified on SQL server. By using running individual quires we are getting expected results. But when we check in Exchange we do see discrepancies.

We have observed few errors in AD_Contact listing job .Please find below screenshot.

 

We had 2 hours call with your team and they suggested to grab job details and share. I have attached .zip files in ticket.

Please consider this issue on priority. As its updating co-operate communication DLs.

 



 


Thanks,

Tushar Vetal

Hi Tushar

Following up on this as I had not had a response on the Critical item:
I have been reviewing the Critical ticket logged for your StealthAUDIT report issue.

As I understand there is an issue with a custom job running, however you are unfamiliar with this job.

As this is Critical it is important you have a clear definition of what the issue is so we can progress this.

It is pertinent we understand who created the custom job so we can work with that relevant team. Without this progress will be very difficult to reverse engineer the custom work.

Please provide examples of what is not working, screenshots of the relevant jobs, clear examples of any data discrepencies.

Following this you can use the following link to schedule a meeting with me.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=DWICQIBzT1pz0BMopwRqhg3BMnbITxocGgeROsN5l_s-Z&MeetingID=hw4Mu7qdka3guQOt7Uav1evs.4uh_JLpBgQ4M8CaW_k-Z

I did not see any meetings scheduled today, please review following days for the Critical meeting.

In line with our support agreement for a Critical level ticket can you provide examples of:
The software being unavailable/inaccessible.
Server downtime, performance degradations or failure of business Critical system related to StealthAUDIT.

Thank you for meeting today.

I reviewed the custom job which we determined was created 10 years ago for AIG through Stealthbits (Now Netwrix).

We could determine the job is running and collecting the correct data, but it does not join successfully. 
As your team is unfamiliar with this job, and there is a deadline to decommission the old server, I will be raising this with the Professional Services team and your account manager Jim Sawyer (In CC).

This custom job should be worked on as part of a Professional Services engagement.

Any items that would help us understand the intended function of this custom job would be beneficial.

Hello Alex,

Issue  : Dls are not updating after complete all jobs.

We have verified on SQL server. By using running individual quires we are getting expected results. But when we check in Exchange we do see discrepancies.
We have observed few errors in AD_Contact listing job .Please find below screenshot.

We had 2 hours call with your team and they suggested to grab job details and share. I have attached .zip files in ticket.
Please consider this issue on priority. As its updating co-operate communication DLs.

Hi Tushar

Following up on this as I had not had a response on the Critical item:
I have been reviewing the Critical ticket logged for your StealthAUDIT report issue.

As I understand there is an issue with a custom job running, however you are unfamiliar with this job.

As this is Critical it is important you have a clear definition of what the issue is so we can progress this.

It is pertinent we understand who created the custom job so we can work with that relevant team. Without this progress will be very difficult to reverse engineer the custom work.

Please provide examples of what is not working, screenshots of the relevant jobs, clear examples of any data discrepencies.

Following this you can use the following link to schedule a meeting with me.

https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=DWICQIBzT1pz0BMopwRqhg3BMnbITxocGgeROsN5l_s-Z&MeetingID=hw4Mu7qdka3guQOt7Uav1evs.4uh_JLpBgQ4M8CaW_k-Z<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=DWICQIBzT1pz0BMopwRqhg3BMnbITxocGgeROsN5l_s-Z&MeetingID=hw4Mu7qdka3guQOt7Uav1evs.4uh_JLpBgQ4M8CaW_k-Z__;!!NT3rrZz_VG2e!IWk_Vo_FjWeeLmlwAO_bXgyNnA4THcjbDr1nnRSGZ5kSChnFw_Gvw4AC86eF2us_QCG3Tl_Qiq_Ys33AOWjw617HAUI$>

I did not see any meetings scheduled today, please review following days for the Critical meeting.

In line with our support agreement for a Critical level ticket can you provide examples of:
The software being unavailable/inaccessible.
Server downtime, performance degradations or failure of business Critical system related to StealthAUDIT.

Hi tushar,

I've tried to reach you by phone number (973) 533-2717, but I couldn't get through.

Can you provide more information about what exactly doesn't work?

You have a separate ticket 00413908 regarding the DL_Feeds job health check.
We can continue or check in the corresponding ticket if this is not a different issue.

Hi Tushar,Saikiran,

Thank you for meeting today.

I reviewed the custom job which we determined was created 10 years ago for AIG through Stealthbits (Now Netwrix).

We could determine the job is running and collecting the correct data, but it does not join successfully. 
As your team is unfamiliar with this job, and there is a deadline to decommission the old server, I will be raising this with the Professional Services team and your account manager Jim Sawyer (In CC).

This custom job should be worked on as part of a Professional Services engagement.

Any items that would help us understand the intended function of this custom job would be beneficial.

Best regards,

Alex Buchta
Support Team Lead EMEA

Hello alex,

 

This case 00413908 is for old server.

 

We have another issue where action job is completed but in exchange DLs are not getting updated.

Can you please schedule a meeting. Please consider as urgent.

 


Thanks,

Tushar Vetal

Hi tushar,

I've tried to reach you by phone number (973) 533-2717, but I couldn't get through.

Can you provide more information about what exactly doesn't work?

You have a separate ticket 00413908 regarding the DL_Feeds job health check.
We can continue or check in the corresponding ticket if this is not a different issue.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA
