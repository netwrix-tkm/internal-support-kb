Solution or fix:
+++++
1) AD_WeakPasswrods > right-click and select Properties > Connection tab > 'Select one of the following user defined profiles' > <nothing was selected>

2) We selected 'SBServiceAccount' from the drop-down

3) Now the AD_WeakPasswords processed 21K+ AD accounts as it should.

4) Next you ran the CDSA Report and all of the Weak Passwords queries were executing and we spot-checked the Results > 'AD_WeakPasswords_Details' and observed that they were now populated.

5) We ensured that no other jobs were running (CDSA Job may lock tables) and then we ran the CDSA Job Group.  Once the CDSA Job Group completed (under 7 minutes to complete) we observed in the the slide #9, titled as 'CONDITION: Weak Passwords' was populated with data.
