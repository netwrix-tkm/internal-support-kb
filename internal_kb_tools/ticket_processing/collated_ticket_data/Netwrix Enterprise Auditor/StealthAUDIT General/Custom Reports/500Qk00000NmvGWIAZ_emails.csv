My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From your description it appears that you need a custom report built. Are you looking for documentation on the report building, or do you need assistance creating it?

Unfortunately the support teams cannot help create custom reports, but if you do want assistance we can refer you to the professional services team and they can assist creating these reports but there is an additional cost for this.
Please let me know how you'd like to proceed and I can help you however I can.



Thank you,

Here is the documentation on how to create a custom report.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/09.Reporting/Creating_a_Report.htm

Here is the documentation on the data collectors. Under each collector you can see what data they collect and what database tables they are writing data to.
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Chapters/06.Data_Collectors/06.Data_Collectors.htm

Here is the documentation on the SQLViewCreation Utility that you can also use to combine data from two tables to get information you may need.

Hi Ian,

Initially, I was disappointed to learn that support doesn't help with creating custom reports. However, I escalated the request and am pleased to have a call scheduled today with Devon Anderson. He was our implementation specialist and provided excellent assistance in creating custom reports.

Regards,
Brian
