Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

I've created a custom job to gather all job messages for the targeted hosts. 

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Hi Ramesh, Thank you for the reply. Do I understand correctly you were expected to see those errors in the report? Where did this report come from in StealthAUDIT? Is this a custom report? Best regards, Aleksandr Timofeev Technical Support

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev

I've created a custom job to gather all job messages for the targeted hosts. 

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Before execution please make sure the Host List(s) is/are attached to this job.

Let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Ramesh,

I've created a custom job to gather all job messages for the targeted hosts.

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Before execution please make sure the Host List(s) is/are attached to this job.

Let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Ramesh,

I've created a custom job to gather all job messages for the targeted hosts.

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Before execution please make sure the Host List(s) is/are attached to this job.

Let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Before execution please make sure the Host List(s) is/are attached to this job.

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Ramesh,

As I can see in the screenshot you have configured the FILESYSTEMACCESS query which that job doesn't require. That's an SQL analysis task.

You don't need to specify any queries for that job.

Hi Ramesh,

I've created a custom job to gather all job messages for the targeted hosts. 

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Before execution please make sure the Host List(s) is/are attached to this job.

Let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev

Hi Ramesh,

I've created a custom job to gather all job messages for the targeted hosts.

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Before execution please make sure the Host List(s) is/are attached to this job.

Let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

As I can see in the screenshot you have configured the FILESYSTEMACCESS query which that job doesn't require. That's an SQL analysis task.

You don't need to specify any queries for that job.

Hi Ramesh,

I've created a custom job to gather all job messages for the targeted hosts.

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Before execution please make sure the Host List(s) is/are attached to this job.

Let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev

Thank you for the reply.

This is OK for that job. It has a simple JOIN statement inside which doesn't take much time to run.

You can verify the completeness of the data in the FS_JobMessages table.

PLEASE NOTE: This job should be only started when there are no active scans in the ""Running Instances"" tab because it uses the ""SA_Messages"" table which collects messages from every scan that has been made.

Please let me know if the data is incomplete/invalid or if some modifications to this job should be done.

Hi Ramesh,

I've created a custom job to gather all job messages for the targeted hosts. 

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Before execution please make sure the Host List(s) is/are attached to this job.

Let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for the reply.

This is OK for that job. It has a simple JOIN statement inside which doesn't take much time to run.

You can verify the completeness of the data in the FS_JobMessages table.

PLEASE NOTE: This job should be only started when there are no active scans in the ""Running Instances"" tab because it uses the ""SA_Messages"" table which collects messages from every scan that has been made.

Please let me know if the data is incomplete/invalid or if some modifications to this job should be done.

Hi Ramesh,

I've created a custom job to gather all job messages for the targeted hosts. 

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Before execution please make sure the Host List(s) is/are attached to this job.

Let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for the reply.

This is OK for that job. It has a simple JOIN statement inside which doesn't take much time to run.

You can verify the completeness of the data in the FS_JobMessages table.

PLEASE NOTE: This job should be only started when there are no active scans in the ""Running Instances"" tab because it uses the ""SA_Messages"" table which collects messages from every scan that has been made.

Please let me know if the data is incomplete/invalid or if some modifications to this job should be done.

As I can see in the screenshot you have configured the FILESYSTEMACCESS query which that job doesn't require. That's an SQL analysis task.

You don't need to specify any queries for that job.

Hi Ramesh,

I've created a custom job to gather all job messages for the targeted hosts.

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Before execution please make sure the Host List(s) is/are attached to this job.

Let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
Technical Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for the reply.

This is OK for that job. It has a simple JOIN statement inside which doesn't take much time to run.

You can verify the completeness of the data in the FS_JobMessages table.

PLEASE NOTE: This job should be only started when there are no active scans in the ""Running Instances"" tab because it uses the ""SA_Messages"" table which collects messages from every scan that has been made.

Please let me know if the data is incomplete/invalid or if some modifications to this job should be done.

Ramesh,

As I can see in the screenshot you have configured the FILESYSTEMACCESS query which that job doesn't require. That's an SQL analysis task.

You don't need to specify any queries for that job.

Hi Ramesh,

I've created a custom job to gather all job messages for the targeted hosts. 

Please find the GROUP_FS Job Messages.zip in the attachments. Unzip and copy this job folder into Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITJobs folder.

Before execution please make sure the Host List(s) is/are attached to this job.

Let me know if any adjustments are needed.

Hi Ramesh,

Thank you for your time on the meeting today.

The current report you have is using the Bulk_Import_Activity table and doesn't have error messages of FSAA/FSAC System Scans and Bulk Import jobs.

You need to use the ""SA_Messages"" table instead to report on the error messages for those jobs.

I will do some research in my lab as it would require some customization and let you know the results.

Best regards,

Aleksandr Timofeev
