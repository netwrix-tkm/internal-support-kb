What would be the easiest way to identify where these permissions are missing?  I don't believe an out of the box report provides that info, so I can either create a report or run a SQL query to get the info.

What would be the easiest way to identify where these permissions are missing?

Determined that multiple reports would need to be created to target the different change types for email automation. I suggested using the NAM console to get a more reactionary result of the permission changes.","Guidance","Scottie Taylor","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT General","Custom Reports","11.6","","4.9","Closed - Resolved","Hawaii Pacific Health","Amy Caliboso","2024-08-01T00:34:38.000Z","2024-08-05T21:47:13.000Z"
