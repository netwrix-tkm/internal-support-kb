2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
