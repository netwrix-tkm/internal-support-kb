After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.

[cid:image002.png@01DB927B.5E9C35D0]

This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?


Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration:
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center



Thank you,
Mike Candon

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Thanks,

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Subject: RE: NEA - Switching active scanning nodes on Dell Isilon using the EMC Isilon plugin [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0LV5qX:ref ]

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?


Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration:
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center



Thank you,

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.



This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.  

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.


Thanks,

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.

[cid:image002.png@01DB92C0.75B27F50]

This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Thanks,

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Subject: RE: NEA - Switching active scanning nodes on Dell Isilon using the EMC Isilon plugin [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0LV5qX:ref ]

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?


Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration:
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center



Thank you,
Mike Candon

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.



This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.  

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

 

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name. 
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?
 

Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration: 
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center 
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center 




Thank you,

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan.

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after
Thanks,

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Thanks,

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Subject: RE: NEA - Switching active scanning nodes on Dell Isilon using the EMC Isilon plugin [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0LV5qX:ref ]

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?


Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration:
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center



Thank you,

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan. 

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.



This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.  

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name. 
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?
 

Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration: 
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center 
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server. 

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data. 

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan. 

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.



This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.  

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

 

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name. 
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?
 

Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration: 
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center 
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server 

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server. 

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data. 

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan. 

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.



This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.  

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

 

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name. 
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?
 

Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration: 
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center 
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center 




Thank you,

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server.

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data.

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan.

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.

[cid:image003.png@01DB9714.53D994B0]

This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Subject: RE: NEA - Switching active scanning nodes on Dell Isilon using the EMC Isilon plugin [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0LV5qX:ref ]

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?


Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration:
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center



Thank you,
Mike Candon

Sorry for the delayed.

Today we did:

1. Moved Agent to new Isilon.
2. Confirmed agent receiving events.
3. Renamed old host to new host in FSAA hosts table.
4. confirmed AIC took change and appears to be cooperating as expected.

Next Steps: 
1. Let scans run over night so we can review potentially on a quick call tomorrow

Nicholas,

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server.

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data.

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan.

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.

[cid:image008.png@01DB9909.284CD180]

This is a windows host so \bwest-fs<file://bwest-fs/> is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?


Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration:
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center



Thank you,
Mike Candon

Nicholas, 

 

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server 

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.



Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server. 

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data. 

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan. 

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.



This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.  

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

 

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name. 
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?
 

Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration: 
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center 
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center 




Thank you,

Nicholas,

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server.

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data.

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan.

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.

[cid:image005.png@01DB9977.481FE790]

This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

Thanks,

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Thanks,

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Subject: RE: NEA - Switching active scanning nodes on Dell Isilon using the EMC Isilon plugin [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0LV5qX:ref ]

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?


Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration:
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center



Thank you,
Mike Candon

Nicholas, 

 

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server 

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.



Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server. 

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data. 

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan. 

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue. 

 


Thanks,

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.



This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.  

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

 

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name. 
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?
 

Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration: 
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center 
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center 




Thank you,

Hello,

During our configuration we renamed the activity from from akrnmgmt to akrndata and it stopped collecting logs.  We renamed it because of a name mismatch, so we need to figure out the name mismatch error so we can continue the scans with the correct names.

Thanks,

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server.

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data.

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan.

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.

[cid:image007.png@01DB9CB7.BF3150B0]

This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Thanks,

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?


Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration:
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center



Thank you,
Mike Candon

Hello, 

 

During our configuration we renamed the activity from from akrnmgmt to akrndata and it stopped collecting logs.  We renamed it because of a name mismatch, so we need to figure out the name mismatch error so we can continue the scans with the correct names.  

 


Thanks,

Nicholas, 

 

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

 



 


Thanks,

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server 

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.



Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server. 

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data. 

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan. 

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.



This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.  

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

 

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name. 
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?
 

Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration: 
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center 
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center 




Thank you,

We worked with Nicholas Zimmer last week to get this accomplished.  He is out on vacation this week, so I put another ticket in.  We moved our primary Isilon to a new array with a new name in a new datacenter and he helped us convert our database to keep the old scan data.

Thanks,

Hi Jason,

Can you help me understand where this name change was made? was the Isilon node renamed? Or was a reference name in Enterprise Auditor changed?

How does this change relate to the topic of the ticket to scan passive nodes?

Thank you,

Hello,

During our configuration we renamed the activity from from akrnmgmt to akrndata and it stopped collecting logs.  We renamed it because of a name mismatch, so we need to figure out the name mismatch error so we can continue the scans with the correct names.

Thanks,

Nicholas,

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server.

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data.

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan.

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.

[cid:image007.png@01DB9E3B.0D4498A0]

This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Thanks,

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Subject: RE: NEA - Switching active scanning nodes on Dell Isilon using the EMC Isilon plugin [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0LV5qX:ref ]

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?


Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration:
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center



Thank you,

We worked with Nicholas Zimmer last week to get this accomplished.  He is out on vacation this week, so I put another ticket in.  We moved our primary Isilon to a new array with a new name in a new datacenter and he helped us convert our database to keep the old scan data.

Hi Jason,

Can you help me understand where this name change was made? was the Isilon node renamed? Or was a reference name in Enterprise Auditor changed?

How does this change relate to the topic of the ticket to scan passive nodes?

Thank you,

Hello, 

 

During our configuration we renamed the activity from from akrnmgmt to akrndata and it stopped collecting logs.  We renamed it because of a name mismatch, so we need to figure out the name mismatch error so we can continue the scans with the correct names.

Nicholas, 

 

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server 

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.



Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server. 

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data. 

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan. 

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

 


Thanks,

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.



This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.  

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

 

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name. 
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?
 

Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration: 
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center 
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center 




Thank you,

We worked with Nicholas Zimmer last week to get this accomplished.  He is out on vacation this week, so I put another ticket in.  We moved our primary Isilon to a new array with a new name in a new datacenter and he helped us convert our database to keep the old scan data.

Hi Jason,

Can you help me understand where this name change was made? was the Isilon node renamed? Or was a reference name in Enterprise Auditor changed?

How does this change relate to the topic of the ticket to scan passive nodes?

Hello,

During our configuration we renamed the activity from from akrnmgmt to akrndata and it stopped collecting logs.  We renamed it because of a name mismatch, so we need to figure out the name mismatch error so we can continue the scans with the correct names.

Nicholas,

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server.

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data.

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan.

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.

[cid:image007.png@01DB9E52.4AD21370]

This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Subject: RE: NEA - Switching active scanning nodes on Dell Isilon using the EMC Isilon plugin [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0LV5qX:ref ]

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?


Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration:
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center



Thank you,

We are not in a working state yet so I don’t think it can be closed.  I would like to keep it open until we verify all functionality is working.

We worked with Nicholas Zimmer last week to get this accomplished.  He is out on vacation this week, so I put another ticket in.  We moved our primary Isilon to a new array with a new name in a new datacenter and he helped us convert our database to keep the old scan data.

Hi Jason,

Can you help me understand where this name change was made? was the Isilon node renamed? Or was a reference name in Enterprise Auditor changed?

How does this change relate to the topic of the ticket to scan passive nodes?

Thank you,

Hello, 

 

During our configuration we renamed the activity from from akrnmgmt to akrndata and it stopped collecting logs.  We renamed it because of a name mismatch, so we need to figure out the name mismatch error so we can continue the scans with the correct names.

Nicholas, 

 

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server 

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.



Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server. 

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data. 

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan. 

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.



This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.  

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

 

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name. 
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?
 

Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration: 
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center 
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center 




Thank you,

We worked with Nicholas Zimmer last week to get this accomplished.  He is out on vacation this week, so I put another ticket in.  We moved our primary Isilon to a new array with a new name in a new datacenter and he helped us convert our database to keep the old scan data.

Hi Jason,

Can you help me understand where this name change was made? was the Isilon node renamed? Or was a reference name in Enterprise Auditor changed?

How does this change relate to the topic of the ticket to scan passive nodes?

Hello, 

 

During our configuration we renamed the activity from from akrnmgmt to akrndata and it stopped collecting logs.  We renamed it because of a name mismatch, so we need to figure out the name mismatch error so we can continue the scans with the correct names.

Nicholas, 

 

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server 

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.



Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server. 

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data. 

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan. 

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after
Thanks,

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

After this initial change the new scans will be smart enough to just add to this data once I change the Isilon host in the interface?

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.



This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Any updates on this?  We should also probably touch base on exactly what the scans will look like after the switch over.

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.  

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

 

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name. 
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?
 

Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration: 
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center 
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center 




Thank you,

We worked with Nicholas Zimmer last week to get this accomplished.  He is out on vacation this week, so I put another ticket in.  We moved our primary Isilon to a new array with a new name in a new datacenter and he helped us convert our database to keep the old scan data.

Hi Jason,

Can you help me understand where this name change was made? was the Isilon node renamed? Or was a reference name in Enterprise Auditor changed?

How does this change relate to the topic of the ticket to scan passive nodes?

Thank you,

Hello,

During our configuration we renamed the activity from from akrnmgmt to akrndata and it stopped collecting logs.  We renamed it because of a name mismatch, so we need to figure out the name mismatch error so we can continue the scans with the correct names.

Thanks,

Jason Gray

Nicholas,

It looks like it is doing the bulk import and its taking a lot longer then normal.  See screenshot.  It normally takes an hour or two and its almost 5 now.

Jason,

I have one more scenario to test to see if it is more efficient  however I did get it to work as is.

I have one ask of you whenever you know the Name of the new server.

This should be done when you can and at least a day prior to implementing the Activity monitor agent  on the New server.
Also disable the FSAC Collection. This will make the transition easier.

Steps and Screenshot below. If you want to meet to do this and discuss the next steps let me know. Otherwise after the new server is ready prior to the New Agent install for activity on the New server. Then We can implement part 2, in order to ""move"" our activity data from the old server to the new server

1. In NAM go to the Current FS. and Double click on the File output.
2. Go to the Additional properties tab.
3. Enter the name of the new server the way you will be updating host lists. So if you are using Netbios or FQDN with the current server it makes sense to do the same with the new server.
4. Hit OK.

Hello Jason,

I believe the DFS will behave just fine from my testing but I am having a hang up on getting the old data for Activity to cooperate.

I am going to try fresh tomorrow after going for circles for several hours throughout today, and am collaborating with another team that believes this should be doable.

I'll update on that front tomorrow.

Alternatively my question is: Why do we need to just move the activity over?

This is how it would play out going that route.
We can preserve the Activity of the current server by just no longer targeting it with NEA. And then we can purge whenever your retention settings dictate.
That data will remain in reports and AIC so you can Still review it. When looking at AIC you will have both servers listed.
If you are looking at Permissions or Current activity we look at the new server. If you want older Activity you look at the old server.

Any current reports could be filtered to only show current data.

If I am missing something please let me know, I'll still report on my further testing tomorrow.

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

I appreciate the time and call today.

I will get the testing rolling here shortly.

My Plan.

1. Configure/get hold of a DFS config with activity.
2. Drop dfs data.
3. Rename host / update NEA/NAM to reflect new name
4. Run collections and DFS.
5. Review to confirm things are cool.

I'll update you after

Can we set up a meeting where we can peek at the tables too?  In SSMS.

I believe this should still work, but My lab isn't your environment.  I don't think that part should be a problem or different with DFS.

Are you sure this is the right field?  I had my SQL admin look at it and it appears that the only thing in this is the DFS name share.  Not the hard coding of the Isilon share name.  Please advise.

Sorry for longer than planned delay.

I have completed testing. We can modify the SA_AIC_Resources table

So if its 1 to 1 move like shares aren't moving depth just moving servers but staying at the same level.

UPDATE sa_aic_resources
SET Value = REPLACE(Value, '\NZIMMER-FS', '\New nzimmer-fs')
WHERE Value LIKE '\NZIMMER-FS%';

This will work.

Now if some shares end up in different depths we will have to know the updated path and edit our script.

Ok. I am going to do some testing in my lab today/tomorrow and update you, but I think I have a script I can repurpose to update the name and confirm the AIC behaves.

I just want to see it behaves rather than assume it will work.

I'll update you after that.

Thanks for the information.  The only thing that changes in the UNC path is the hostname, everything else in the path will stay the same.  So if we can create a script that goes into the database and changes the hostname from the old one to new one that will probably fix our issue.

Hello Jason,

So finally got a few answers.

Mainly. We will have to modify scans to target the new Isilon, which as long as nodes are set up as expected. It will continue to scan like it currently does. Assuming everything is migrated and data and permissions are there.

As far as the AIC reviews are concerned we need to see how the SA_AIC_Resources table is set up.The UNC paths on the resource, if they will remain the same, will still work fine post migration.

If they would change then we would have to script something up to update all of those reviews to match the new UNC path.
Here is an example from our labs.

[cid:image007.png@01DBA9F0.23F278E0]

This is a windows host so \bwest-fs is the part that needs to stay the same post migration to allow the reviews to remain valid.

Do we know if that UNC path would change to the shares on the Isilon?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer
Technical Support Engineer Tier II

I guess it was more of a question on my part, but you clarified the hostname/isilon name, that we currently scan, will be different but the internals will be the same.

Initial response is not sure if this is something we can fix in the host table and allow a smooth transition. But with the different name not sure the AIC will properly move the Reviews, as they are tied to Hostname.

I am still looking into this waiting on a response from development. I'll update as soon as I have some more details.

Thanks,

Thanks for the follow up.  Can you elaborate on the Isilon name is valid or migrated?  The name will not migrate and the new Isilon has a different name but the same data.

We do not have a test Isilon cluster to test on.

Thanks,

Jason Gray

Hello Team,

So trying to rustle up some official documentation, however  development believes that as long as the Isilon name that we are targeting is valid or migrated to the new location, NEA should handle and continue to handle scanning as usual.

If possible is there a smaller Islion cluster or test one we could set up to do a test migration to confirm this?

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hi Jason and Corey,

1) Our Tier 2 TSE would like to review your environment.

2) As long as the node name is the same we could keep things going (when switching from one data center to the new one) but if you migrate and rename (or re-point to a new URL?), it will be treated as a new server and there isn't a reasonable way to migrate our data from one name to the new name.
We could retain the old data then drop it when the new name has enough data.

3) We can try to collect once a week, but don't advise that due to how long it may take to import but this depends on the environment.
Take this statement with a grain of salt as you are already doing this correct?


Below is a summary of our meeting today:

+++++
2025_0212: Meeting with Jason and Corey
+++++

1) Do we have any customers who are just scanning backup nodes (a 'passive node' that may be one day behind in data). The customer is asking if they can capture the activity data of a synched node - a passive node and not an active node. And they are switching from the active node to the passive node.

2) How does NEA handle a new URL switching from Westfield to Akron but it will be the same data? It is technically a new array but the same data. How does NEA handle that transition as their Akron data center has always had the same data as Westfield (but passive versus active) Currently Isilon does not scan the passive node right now at all.

The passive node is a day behind in terms of replication. It will be a new URL but all of the same data.

3) They scan once a week to capture all file activities.

+++++
Current data center configuration:
+++++
Westfield, OH - Active Data Center - will be deactivated
Akron, OH - Passive Data Center -

+++++
Switching to or migration to:
+++++
Akron, OH - will become the new Active Data Center
Pittsburgh, PA - will become the new Passive Data Center



Thank you,
