Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we reviewed the ongoing FSAA scan that we started at the end of our meeting on your other ticket, 008431849. The scan has been running for 66hrs and is about 31% complete. It's not surprising that the scan is taking a long time; it is a very large data source. Like we discussed, lets meet again next week after it's had time to complete.

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we discovered that the previous scan was aborted on 03/21/25 in the afternoon, sometime after our meeting that day. Looking through the logs, we couldn't find any evidence of an error that would have caused the scan to abort. It looked more like somebody rebooted the server. A new scan is already running and is at 41%.

I adjusted the scan settings so, if this one fails again, the next run will only scan 2 levels deep. This will significantly decrease the scan time and will at least let us confirm the permissions data is reporting in the Access Information Center. This will not affect the current run. I also adjust the bulk import's settings to upload data to SQL even if the scan doesn't complete.

Like we discussed, keep an eye on it over the next couple days. Please let me know how it goes.

Looking through the logs, we couldn't find any evidence of an error that would have caused the scan to abort. It looked more like somebody rebooted the server. A new scan is already running and is at 41%.

I adjusted the scan settings so, if this one fails again, the next run will only scan 2 levels deep. This will significantly decrease the scan time and will at least let us confirm the permissions data is reporting in the Access Information Center. This will not affect the current run. I also adjust the bulk import's settings to upload data to SQL even if the scan doesn't complete.

Like we discussed, keep an eye on it over the next couple days. Please let me know how it goes.

Thank you,

Hello Josh,

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we reviewed the ongoing FSAA scan that we started at the end of our meeting on your other ticket, 008431849. The scan has been running for 66hrs and is about 31% complete. It's not surprising that the scan is taking a long time; it is a very large data source. Like we discussed, lets meet again next week after it's had time to complete.

Please use this link to schedule the follow-up meeting:

Hello Josh,

Thank you for the update. This scan had already started before our last meeting, so the change I made to scan only 2 levels deep, for troubleshooting purposes, will not take effect until the next scan. Looking at the job's ""Job Stats"", is it still on the same scan or does it look like it failed again and restarted again?

Thank you,

Hello Josh,

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we discovered that the previous scan was aborted on 03/21/25 in the afternoon, sometime after our meeting that day. Looking through the logs, we couldn't find any evidence of an error that would have caused the scan to abort. It looked more like somebody rebooted the server. A new scan is already running and is at 41%.

I adjusted the scan settings so, if this one fails again, the next run will only scan 2 levels deep.

Thank you for meeting with me. In our session we confirmed that the scan had completed successfully. We also confirmed that the Access Information Center reported good permissions data for the NAS shares. Searching for a particular group allowed us to view the folder permissions that group. This should be helpful for your team as when the want to know the effect deleting specific groups will have to folder access.
Important:
I forgot that in our previous meeting, we reduced the scan depth to only 2 levels. This was in case the scan restarted again, so the new scan wouldn't take as long to complete. Now that we have confirmed it's working as expected, you should set the scan depth back to full. It will likely take more than a week to scan again, but that is expected given the size of the NAS. To set the scan depth back to full:

Navigate to:
StealthAUDIT console > Jobs > File System > 0.Collection > Permissions > 1-FSAA System Scans > Configure > Queries > Query Properties > Configure
File System Access Auditor Data Collector Wizard > Default Scoping Options
Uncheck ""Limit subfolder scan depth to""


I'm sorry I forgot to change that back.

I'll wait to hear back from you about changing that setting back before I close the ticket. I want to make sure it's not missed moving forward.

Please let me know how it goes.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton

I'm just following up to make sure you say my last email. In our last meeting we discussed closing the ticket because it's working as expected, however I forgot to set the scan depth back to full depth.  Please follow the instructions in my previous email to enable a full depth scan and let me know, so I can close this ticket.
