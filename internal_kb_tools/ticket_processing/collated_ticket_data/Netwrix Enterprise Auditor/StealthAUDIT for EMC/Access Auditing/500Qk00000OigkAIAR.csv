"500Qk00000OigkAIAR","00443938","Support Ticket","Connecting To Dell Isilon","We are looking for assistance configuring Dell Isilon where we are seeing access denied on the share that we are scoping the FSAA scan to. We have configured it according to the documentation. However, we are still running into trouble. We worked directly with Dell support, and they are suggesting we permit NTFS permissions for the scan account to the share directly. But the goal would be to bypass NTFS permissions. Dell is researching this, however we are reaching out to you to see if you can help us in tandem.

The one section of the document that we'd like more details on is the quote below. 
   ""Rights on the actual file tree or to the IFS root share
        Share Permissions:
            Read access""

Does this mean the requested permission is read-only on the scoped share? Or do we need more permissions further up the tree. We only need to scan one share called admin$ but it's a few levels deep from the root.
