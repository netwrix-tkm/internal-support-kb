Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. By accessing the query properties of the FSAA system scan job you can perform a reset of the filesystem data. This can be accessed under the maintenance tab within the query properties. Once the reset has been completed please run the FSAA bulk import once more.

If you would like to schedule a meeting you may use the link below:

Hi Scottie,

I had to run it several times to get it to work The last time I finally did not get the error about the data anymore, however the job still errored out with the following message. Sam as I was getting for along with the data issue.

“User does not have permission to perform this action.”

Let me know what I should try next, or if you prefer, we can schedule some time for you to look at the system.

Thank you for attending our scheduled meeting today. We discovered that the FSAA Bulk import was failing due to a permissions-based issue occurring on the update statistics SQL script for the analysis task. I recommend providing the service account used in the job with this permission and running the bulk import again. 

Please provide an update on the results of the bulk import. 

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Scottie,

 

I had to run it several times to get it to work The last time I finally did not get the error about the data anymore, however the job still errored out with the following message. Sam as I was getting for along with the data issue.

 

“User does not have permission to perform this action.”

 

Let me know what I should try next, or if you prefer, we can schedule some time for you to look at the system.

 


Thanks

Hi Scottie,

W had the SQL DBAs fix the permission issue. I have not been able to test the job yet due to timing with other jobs that are currently running, But I expect to be able to test it in the next day or so.

I will let you know as soon as I confirm that the issue has been resolved.
