@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer - After discussing this in refinement with development. It appears environmental since the logs won't show things like if FQDN or NetBIOS is used for both locations, have we verified personally that there are matching naming conventions for one? I also suggest we verify that other scanner settings are as they should be. I've made an item on the backlog however since this is P3 it will be a while before development can really look at logs in depth.
