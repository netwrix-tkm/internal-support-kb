I had to restart the scan due to a network outage. However, the scan did fail again after a couple days. Same out of memory errors. I have uploaded the log file.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for checking for me. I'm working on getting this escalated to development.

Please navigate to the SEEK Scan job's properties and make sure the log level is set to DEBUG. It defaults to WARNING, and I can't remember if we changed it to DEBUG already.

The exact structure of your Job tree is likely different, but you need to right-click on the SEEK System Scan job and click Properties.
[cid:image001.png@01DB3101.3E25E200]



Is the Log Level already set to DEBUG?

[cid:image002.png@01DB3101.3E25E200]


If not, please set it to DEBUG, save, then run the job again.
Once the job fails, export the Job (include all job components) and attach the .zip to the ticket:

[cid:image003.png@01DB3101.3E25E200]

If the Log Level was already set to DEBUG, you skip straight to exporting the job.

Thank you,

It is a virtual machine. However, I confirmed with our system admin that the hypervisor is not running low memory (that host is only using 40% of 2TB RAM with 100% allocation to vm guests – plenty of headroom there). So I don’t think that is the issue.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for that data. Is your application server a virtual machine? We've seen this behavior before where the application throws out of memory errors even though the server shows low RAM utilization. It turned out that the Hypervisor was running out of RAM.

If it is a virtual machine, please check the available RAM on the hypervisor.

Thank you,

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry to see the page file didn't help. There is something else to look at. Could you please run a PowerShell command for me, then attach the output?

Run PowerShell as an administrator and navigate to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory. Default directory: ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDIT""

Run the command:
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter ""system.data.sqlite.dll"" | Format-List -property *version* > SQLiteVersion.txt

It should create a file in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory called SQLiteVersion.txt
It will look something like this:

[cid:image004.png@01DB3101.3E25E200]

Please attach that file to the ticket. I want to see which FileVersions are listed.

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry; I misspoke. You are correct that the SQL server is not likely in play here.

Regarding the page file, I double checked with a senior engineer, and we recommend having the page file configured so that it only uses one drive. The issue seems to be that Windows does a poor job splitting the page file across multiple drives.
Disable ""Automatically manage paging file for all drive""
Set whichever drive is the largest or typically has the most free-space to ""System managed size""
Set the other drive to ""No paging file""
Reboot the server for the change to take effect

[cid:image005.png@01DB3101.3E25E200]

The new error, ""...illegal operation attempted on a registry key that has been marked for deletion"" typically just means you need to reboot the server. If you make the page file change, you need to reboot anyway.

I know each of these scan attempts takes days to finish/fail. I'm sorry for the hassle, but please let me know if this helps.

Thank you,

The page file is currently set to let the system automatically manage the size. Would you suggest we change that to a static limit?  You also mentioned that the SQL server might be running out of memory? I assumed the SEEK scan was primarily using the local Tier 2 SQLite database until the bulk import is ran?

The scan did end up failing again after several days, this time different errors. I’ve attached the log.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for the update. The logs made it look like an issue with memory on the SQL server, but it could be the page file instead. Are you able to check and potentially increase the page file maximum size? You can also allow the page file to use an additional drive, if there's one to use.

Start > Run > systempropertiesperformance.exe > Advanced > Change
[cid:image008.png@01DB3101.3E25E200]
changing this will require a reboot

Please let me know how it goes.

Thank you,

The scan ended up failing again after a couple of days. Supposedly due to the “out of memory” failures again although it does not look like the server ever exceeded 60% usage of memory during the scan. I backed off the thread count some and have started the scan again (yesterday). I may add more memory again to the server depending on how it goes this time.

Thanks,
Kyle

Hey Kyle,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

  1.  Were getting the below error on the SEEK System Scan

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Error during processing:  Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SQLite, Version=1.0.117.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)

  1.  Updated the Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on to v11.6.0.13 --this did not fix our error
  2.  Found where the System.Data.SQLite.dll v1.0.117.0 was in the %SAInstallDir%FSAA folder and replaced the 3 outdated System.Data.SQLite.dll v0.0.96 files with it --this fixed our SEEK error
  3.  Ran into a new issue where we were unable to run the SEEK group from the Schedules node

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   We added the svc_stealthbits account to the Settings > Schedule node to be used for Scheduled Tasks
     *   We recreated the SEEK group scheduled task and were then able to see the task successfully kick off

I'll open and close a ticket for the processing error we fixed today (no action required!) and leave this ticket open until we hear back from you on how the SEEK scan finishes.

Thank you,

I had to restart the scan due to a network outage. However, the scan did fail again after a couple days. Same out of memory errors. I have uploaded the log file.

Thanks,

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for checking for me. I'm working on getting this escalated to development.

Please navigate to the SEEK Scan job's properties and make sure the log level is set to DEBUG. It defaults to WARNING, and I can't remember if we changed it to DEBUG already.

The exact structure of your Job tree is likely different, but you need to right-click on the SEEK System Scan job and click Properties.
[cid:image001.png@01DB31C4.1DCFA4A0]



Is the Log Level already set to DEBUG?

[cid:image002.png@01DB31C4.1DCFA4A0]


If not, please set it to DEBUG, save, then run the job again.
Once the job fails, export the Job (include all job components) and attach the .zip to the ticket:

[cid:image003.png@01DB31C4.1DCFA4A0]

If the Log Level was already set to DEBUG, you skip straight to exporting the job.

Thank you,

It is a virtual machine. However, I confirmed with our system admin that the hypervisor is not running low memory (that host is only using 40% of 2TB RAM with 100% allocation to vm guests – plenty of headroom there). So I don’t think that is the issue.

Kyle

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for that data. Is your application server a virtual machine? We've seen this behavior before where the application throws out of memory errors even though the server shows low RAM utilization. It turned out that the Hypervisor was running out of RAM.

If it is a virtual machine, please check the available RAM on the hypervisor.

Thank you,

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry to see the page file didn't help. There is something else to look at. Could you please run a PowerShell command for me, then attach the output?

Run PowerShell as an administrator and navigate to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory. Default directory: ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDIT""

Run the command:
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter ""system.data.sqlite.dll"" | Format-List -property *version* > SQLiteVersion.txt

It should create a file in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory called SQLiteVersion.txt
It will look something like this:

[cid:image004.png@01DB31C4.1DCFA4A0]

Please attach that file to the ticket. I want to see which FileVersions are listed.

Thank you,

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry; I misspoke. You are correct that the SQL server is not likely in play here.

Regarding the page file, I double checked with a senior engineer, and we recommend having the page file configured so that it only uses one drive. The issue seems to be that Windows does a poor job splitting the page file across multiple drives.
Disable ""Automatically manage paging file for all drive""
Set whichever drive is the largest or typically has the most free-space to ""System managed size""
Set the other drive to ""No paging file""
Reboot the server for the change to take effect

[cid:image005.png@01DB31C4.1DCFA4A0]

The new error, ""...illegal operation attempted on a registry key that has been marked for deletion"" typically just means you need to reboot the server. If you make the page file change, you need to reboot anyway.

I know each of these scan attempts takes days to finish/fail. I'm sorry for the hassle, but please let me know if this helps.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000FzXWI:ref
The page file is currently set to let the system automatically manage the size. Would you suggest we change that to a static limit?  You also mentioned that the SQL server might be running out of memory? I assumed the SEEK scan was primarily using the local Tier 2 SQLite database until the bulk import is ran?

The scan did end up failing again after several days, this time different errors. I’ve attached the log.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for the update. The logs made it look like an issue with memory on the SQL server, but it could be the page file instead. Are you able to check and potentially increase the page file maximum size? You can also allow the page file to use an additional drive, if there's one to use.

Start > Run > systempropertiesperformance.exe > Advanced > Change
[cid:image008.png@01DB31C4.1DCFA4A0]
changing this will require a reboot

Please let me know how it goes.

Thank you,

The scan ended up failing again after a couple of days. Supposedly due to the “out of memory” failures again although it does not look like the server ever exceeded 60% usage of memory during the scan. I backed off the thread count some and have started the scan again (yesterday). I may add more memory again to the server depending on how it goes this time.

Thanks,
Kyle

Hey Kyle,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

  1.  Were getting the below error on the SEEK System Scan

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Error during processing:  Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SQLite, Version=1.0.117.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)

  1.  Updated the Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on to v11.6.0.13 --this did not fix our error
  2.  Found where the System.Data.SQLite.dll v1.0.117.0 was in the %SAInstallDir%FSAA folder and replaced the 3 outdated System.Data.SQLite.dll v0.0.96 files with it --this fixed our SEEK error
  3.  Ran into a new issue where we were unable to run the SEEK group from the Schedules node

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   We added the svc_stealthbits account to the Settings > Schedule node to be used for Scheduled Tasks
     *   We recreated the SEEK group scheduled task and were then able to see the task successfully kick off

I'll open and close a ticket for the processing error we fixed today (no action required!) and leave this ticket open until we hear back from you on how the SEEK scan finishes.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

I had to restart the scan due to a network outage. However, the scan did fail again after a couple days. Same out of memory errors. I have uploaded the log file.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for checking for me. I'm working on getting this escalated to development.

Please navigate to the SEEK Scan job's properties and make sure the log level is set to DEBUG. It defaults to WARNING, and I can't remember if we changed it to DEBUG already.

The exact structure of your Job tree is likely different, but you need to right-click on the SEEK System Scan job and click Properties.
[cid:image001.png@01DB3411.0515BA40]



Is the Log Level already set to DEBUG?

[cid:image002.png@01DB3411.0515BA40]


If not, please set it to DEBUG, save, then run the job again.
Once the job fails, export the Job (include all job components) and attach the .zip to the ticket:

[cid:image003.png@01DB3411.0515BA40]

If the Log Level was already set to DEBUG, you skip straight to exporting the job.

Thank you,

It is a virtual machine. However, I confirmed with our system admin that the hypervisor is not running low memory (that host is only using 40% of 2TB RAM with 100% allocation to vm guests – plenty of headroom there). So I don’t think that is the issue.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for that data. Is your application server a virtual machine? We've seen this behavior before where the application throws out of memory errors even though the server shows low RAM utilization. It turned out that the Hypervisor was running out of RAM.

If it is a virtual machine, please check the available RAM on the hypervisor.

Thank you,

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry to see the page file didn't help. There is something else to look at. Could you please run a PowerShell command for me, then attach the output?

Run PowerShell as an administrator and navigate to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory. Default directory: ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDIT""

Run the command:
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter ""system.data.sqlite.dll"" | Format-List -property *version* > SQLiteVersion.txt

It should create a file in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory called SQLiteVersion.txt
It will look something like this:

[cid:image004.png@01DB3411.0515BA40]

Please attach that file to the ticket. I want to see which FileVersions are listed.

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry; I misspoke. You are correct that the SQL server is not likely in play here.

Regarding the page file, I double checked with a senior engineer, and we recommend having the page file configured so that it only uses one drive. The issue seems to be that Windows does a poor job splitting the page file across multiple drives.
Disable ""Automatically manage paging file for all drive""
Set whichever drive is the largest or typically has the most free-space to ""System managed size""
Set the other drive to ""No paging file""
Reboot the server for the change to take effect

[cid:image005.png@01DB3411.0515BA40]

The new error, ""...illegal operation attempted on a registry key that has been marked for deletion"" typically just means you need to reboot the server. If you make the page file change, you need to reboot anyway.

I know each of these scan attempts takes days to finish/fail. I'm sorry for the hassle, but please let me know if this helps.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton

The page file is currently set to let the system automatically manage the size. Would you suggest we change that to a static limit?  You also mentioned that the SQL server might be running out of memory? I assumed the SEEK scan was primarily using the local Tier 2 SQLite database until the bulk import is ran?

The scan did end up failing again after several days, this time different errors. I’ve attached the log.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for the update. The logs made it look like an issue with memory on the SQL server, but it could be the page file instead. Are you able to check and potentially increase the page file maximum size? You can also allow the page file to use an additional drive, if there's one to use.

Start > Run > systempropertiesperformance.exe > Advanced > Change
[cid:image008.png@01DB3411.0515BA40]
changing this will require a reboot

Please let me know how it goes.

Thank you,

The scan ended up failing again after a couple of days. Supposedly due to the “out of memory” failures again although it does not look like the server ever exceeded 60% usage of memory during the scan. I backed off the thread count some and have started the scan again (yesterday). I may add more memory again to the server depending on how it goes this time.

Thanks,
Kyle

Hey Kyle,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

  1.  Were getting the below error on the SEEK System Scan

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Error during processing:  Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SQLite, Version=1.0.117.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)

  1.  Updated the Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on to v11.6.0.13 --this did not fix our error
  2.  Found where the System.Data.SQLite.dll v1.0.117.0 was in the %SAInstallDir%FSAA folder and replaced the 3 outdated System.Data.SQLite.dll v0.0.96 files with it --this fixed our SEEK error
  3.  Ran into a new issue where we were unable to run the SEEK group from the Schedules node

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   We added the svc_stealthbits account to the Settings > Schedule node to be used for Scheduled Tasks
     *   We recreated the SEEK group scheduled task and were then able to see the task successfully kick off

I'll open and close a ticket for the processing error we fixed today (no action required!) and leave this ticket open until we hear back from you on how the SEEK scan finishes.

Thank you,

John,

Do you think development is going to release a fix to resolve this? Would be curious to at least know if they are able to repeat the issue. I was tempted to try and throw more cpu/memory resources at the server again. I don’t want to waste time and resources though, if there is a bug or issue (kind of seems that way since we did not appear to be fully consuming system resources). I don’t think we have had a full sensitive data scan work since our upgrade at the end of July.

Thanks,

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for checking for me. I'm working on getting this escalated to development.

Please navigate to the SEEK Scan job's properties and make sure the log level is set to DEBUG. It defaults to WARNING, and I can't remember if we changed it to DEBUG already.

The exact structure of your Job tree is likely different, but you need to right-click on the SEEK System Scan job and click Properties.
[cid:image009.png@01DB3BFC.1155BAB0]



Is the Log Level already set to DEBUG?

[cid:image010.png@01DB3BFC.1155BAB0]


If not, please set it to DEBUG, save, then run the job again.
Once the job fails, export the Job (include all job components) and attach the .zip to the ticket:

[cid:image011.png@01DB3BFC.1155BAB0]

If the Log Level was already set to DEBUG, you skip straight to exporting the job.

Thank you,

It is a virtual machine. However, I confirmed with our system admin that the hypervisor is not running low memory (that host is only using 40% of 2TB RAM with 100% allocation to vm guests – plenty of headroom there). So I don’t think that is the issue.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for that data. Is your application server a virtual machine? We've seen this behavior before where the application throws out of memory errors even though the server shows low RAM utilization. It turned out that the Hypervisor was running out of RAM.

If it is a virtual machine, please check the available RAM on the hypervisor.

Thank you,

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry to see the page file didn't help. There is something else to look at. Could you please run a PowerShell command for me, then attach the output?

Run PowerShell as an administrator and navigate to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory. Default directory: ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDIT""

Run the command:
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter ""system.data.sqlite.dll"" | Format-List -property *version* > SQLiteVersion.txt

It should create a file in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory called SQLiteVersion.txt
It will look something like this:

[cid:image012.png@01DB3BFC.1155BAB0]

Please attach that file to the ticket. I want to see which FileVersions are listed.

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry; I misspoke. You are correct that the SQL server is not likely in play here.

Regarding the page file, I double checked with a senior engineer, and we recommend having the page file configured so that it only uses one drive. The issue seems to be that Windows does a poor job splitting the page file across multiple drives.
Disable ""Automatically manage paging file for all drive""
Set whichever drive is the largest or typically has the most free-space to ""System managed size""
Set the other drive to ""No paging file""
Reboot the server for the change to take effect

[cid:image013.png@01DB3BFC.1155BAB0]

The new error, ""...illegal operation attempted on a registry key that has been marked for deletion"" typically just means you need to reboot the server. If you make the page file change, you need to reboot anyway.

I know each of these scan attempts takes days to finish/fail. I'm sorry for the hassle, but please let me know if this helps.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000FzXWI:ref
The page file is currently set to let the system automatically manage the size. Would you suggest we change that to a static limit?  You also mentioned that the SQL server might be running out of memory? I assumed the SEEK scan was primarily using the local Tier 2 SQLite database until the bulk import is ran?

The scan did end up failing again after several days, this time different errors. I’ve attached the log.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for the update. The logs made it look like an issue with memory on the SQL server, but it could be the page file instead. Are you able to check and potentially increase the page file maximum size? You can also allow the page file to use an additional drive, if there's one to use.

Start > Run > systempropertiesperformance.exe > Advanced > Change
[cid:image015.png@01DB3BFC.1155BAB0]
changing this will require a reboot

Please let me know how it goes.

Thank you,

The scan ended up failing again after a couple of days. Supposedly due to the “out of memory” failures again although it does not look like the server ever exceeded 60% usage of memory during the scan. I backed off the thread count some and have started the scan again (yesterday). I may add more memory again to the server depending on how it goes this time.

Thanks,
Kyle

Hey Kyle,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

  1.  Were getting the below error on the SEEK System Scan

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Error during processing:  Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SQLite, Version=1.0.117.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)

  1.  Updated the Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on to v11.6.0.13 --this did not fix our error
  2.  Found where the System.Data.SQLite.dll v1.0.117.0 was in the %SAInstallDir%FSAA folder and replaced the 3 outdated System.Data.SQLite.dll v0.0.96 files with it --this fixed our SEEK error
  3.  Ran into a new issue where we were unable to run the SEEK group from the Schedules node

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   We added the svc_stealthbits account to the Settings > Schedule node to be used for Scheduled Tasks
     *   We recreated the SEEK group scheduled task and were then able to see the task successfully kick off

I'll open and close a ticket for the processing error we fixed today (no action required!) and leave this ticket open until we hear back from you on how the SEEK scan finishes.

Thank you,

Hey Kyle,

I see the latest DevOps comment that the investigation was pulled onto the current development sprint but I don’t have any additional details. I will ask internally for more information on where it stands since that sprint should end next week.

Thanks,

John,

Do you think development is going to release a fix to resolve this? Would be curious to at least know if they are able to repeat the issue. I was tempted to try and throw more cpu/memory resources at the server again. I don’t want to waste time and resources though, if there is a bug or issue (kind of seems that way since we did not appear to be fully consuming system resources). I don’t think we have had a full sensitive data scan work since our upgrade at the end of July.

Thanks,

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for checking for me. I'm working on getting this escalated to development.

Please navigate to the SEEK Scan job's properties and make sure the log level is set to DEBUG. It defaults to WARNING, and I can't remember if we changed it to DEBUG already.

The exact structure of your Job tree is likely different, but you need to right-click on the SEEK System Scan job and click Properties.
[cid:image002.png@01DB3BFD.FC852330]



Is the Log Level already set to DEBUG?

[cid:image003.png@01DB3BFD.FC852330]


If not, please set it to DEBUG, save, then run the job again.
Once the job fails, export the Job (include all job components) and attach the .zip to the ticket:

[cid:image004.png@01DB3BFD.FC852330]

If the Log Level was already set to DEBUG, you skip straight to exporting the job.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000FzXWI:ref
It is a virtual machine. However, I confirmed with our system admin that the hypervisor is not running low memory (that host is only using 40% of 2TB RAM with 100% allocation to vm guests – plenty of headroom there). So I don’t think that is the issue.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for that data. Is your application server a virtual machine? We've seen this behavior before where the application throws out of memory errors even though the server shows low RAM utilization. It turned out that the Hypervisor was running out of RAM.

If it is a virtual machine, please check the available RAM on the hypervisor.

Thank you,

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry to see the page file didn't help. There is something else to look at. Could you please run a PowerShell command for me, then attach the output?

Run PowerShell as an administrator and navigate to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory. Default directory: ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDIT""

Run the command:
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter ""system.data.sqlite.dll"" | Format-List -property *version* > SQLiteVersion.txt

It should create a file in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory called SQLiteVersion.txt
It will look something like this:

[cid:image005.png@01DB3BFD.FC852330]

Please attach that file to the ticket. I want to see which FileVersions are listed.

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry; I misspoke. You are correct that the SQL server is not likely in play here.

Regarding the page file, I double checked with a senior engineer, and we recommend having the page file configured so that it only uses one drive. The issue seems to be that Windows does a poor job splitting the page file across multiple drives.
Disable ""Automatically manage paging file for all drive""
Set whichever drive is the largest or typically has the most free-space to ""System managed size""
Set the other drive to ""No paging file""
Reboot the server for the change to take effect

[cid:image006.png@01DB3BFD.FC852330]

The new error, ""...illegal operation attempted on a registry key that has been marked for deletion"" typically just means you need to reboot the server. If you make the page file change, you need to reboot anyway.

I know each of these scan attempts takes days to finish/fail. I'm sorry for the hassle, but please let me know if this helps.

Thank you,

The page file is currently set to let the system automatically manage the size. Would you suggest we change that to a static limit?  You also mentioned that the SQL server might be running out of memory? I assumed the SEEK scan was primarily using the local Tier 2 SQLite database until the bulk import is ran?

The scan did end up failing again after several days, this time different errors. I’ve attached the log.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for the update. The logs made it look like an issue with memory on the SQL server, but it could be the page file instead. Are you able to check and potentially increase the page file maximum size? You can also allow the page file to use an additional drive, if there's one to use.

Start > Run > systempropertiesperformance.exe > Advanced > Change
[cid:image008.png@01DB3BFD.FC852330]
changing this will require a reboot

The scan ended up failing again after a couple of days. Supposedly due to the “out of memory” failures again although it does not look like the server ever exceeded 60% usage of memory during the scan. I backed off the thread count some and have started the scan again (yesterday). I may add more memory again to the server depending on how it goes this time.

Thanks,
Kyle

  2.  Found where the System.Data.SQLite.dll v1.0.117.0 was in the %SAInstallDir%FSAA folder and replaced the 3 outdated System.Data.SQLite.dll v0.0.96 files with it --this fixed our SEEK error
  3.  Ran into a new issue where we were unable to run the SEEK group from the Schedules node

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   We added the svc_stealthbits account to the Settings > Schedule node to be used for Scheduled Tasks
     *   We recreated the SEEK group scheduled task and were then able to see the task successfully kick off

I'll open and close a ticket for the processing error we fixed today (no action required!) and leave this ticket open until we hear back from you on how the SEEK scan finishes.

Thank you,

Hey Kyle,

Just spoke with our Product Manager for NEA and he mentioned that this issue was also present with another customer and that the results of testing/investigation should be Monday when the sprint ends. I’ll let you know what the results are as soon as I get them and what the plans are for fix/QA testing.

Thanks,

I see the latest DevOps comment that the investigation was pulled onto the current development sprint but I don’t have any additional details. I will ask internally for more information on where it stands since that sprint should end next week.

John,

Do you think development is going to release a fix to resolve this? Would be curious to at least know if they are able to repeat the issue. I was tempted to try and throw more cpu/memory resources at the server again. I don’t want to waste time and resources though, if there is a bug or issue (kind of seems that way since we did not appear to be fully consuming system resources). I don’t think we have had a full sensitive data scan work since our upgrade at the end of July.

Thanks,

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for checking for me. I'm working on getting this escalated to development.

Please navigate to the SEEK Scan job's properties and make sure the log level is set to DEBUG. It defaults to WARNING, and I can't remember if we changed it to DEBUG already.

The exact structure of your Job tree is likely different, but you need to right-click on the SEEK System Scan job and click Properties.
[cid:image002.png@01DB3C00.7575C2C0]



Is the Log Level already set to DEBUG?

[cid:image003.png@01DB3C00.7575C2C0]


If not, please set it to DEBUG, save, then run the job again.
Once the job fails, export the Job (include all job components) and attach the .zip to the ticket:

[cid:image004.png@01DB3C00.7575C2C0]

If the Log Level was already set to DEBUG, you skip straight to exporting the job.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000FzXWI:ref
It is a virtual machine. However, I confirmed with our system admin that the hypervisor is not running low memory (that host is only using 40% of 2TB RAM with 100% allocation to vm guests – plenty of headroom there). So I don’t think that is the issue.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for that data. Is your application server a virtual machine? We've seen this behavior before where the application throws out of memory errors even though the server shows low RAM utilization. It turned out that the Hypervisor was running out of RAM.

If it is a virtual machine, please check the available RAM on the hypervisor.

Thank you,

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry to see the page file didn't help. There is something else to look at. Could you please run a PowerShell command for me, then attach the output?

Run PowerShell as an administrator and navigate to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory. Default directory: ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDIT""

Run the command:
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter ""system.data.sqlite.dll"" | Format-List -property *version* > SQLiteVersion.txt

It should create a file in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory called SQLiteVersion.txt
It will look something like this:

[cid:image005.png@01DB3C00.7575C2C0]

Please attach that file to the ticket. I want to see which FileVersions are listed.

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry; I misspoke. You are correct that the SQL server is not likely in play here.

Regarding the page file, I double checked with a senior engineer, and we recommend having the page file configured so that it only uses one drive. The issue seems to be that Windows does a poor job splitting the page file across multiple drives.
Disable ""Automatically manage paging file for all drive""
Set whichever drive is the largest or typically has the most free-space to ""System managed size""
Set the other drive to ""No paging file""
Reboot the server for the change to take effect

[cid:image006.png@01DB3C00.7575C2C0]

The new error, ""...illegal operation attempted on a registry key that has been marked for deletion"" typically just means you need to reboot the server. If you make the page file change, you need to reboot anyway.

I know each of these scan attempts takes days to finish/fail. I'm sorry for the hassle, but please let me know if this helps.

Thank you,

The page file is currently set to let the system automatically manage the size. Would you suggest we change that to a static limit?  You also mentioned that the SQL server might be running out of memory? I assumed the SEEK scan was primarily using the local Tier 2 SQLite database until the bulk import is ran?

The scan did end up failing again after several days, this time different errors. I’ve attached the log.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for the update. The logs made it look like an issue with memory on the SQL server, but it could be the page file instead. Are you able to check and potentially increase the page file maximum size? You can also allow the page file to use an additional drive, if there's one to use.

Start > Run > systempropertiesperformance.exe > Advanced > Change
[cid:image008.png@01DB3C00.7575C2C0]
changing this will require a reboot

Please let me know how it goes.

Thank you,

The scan ended up failing again after a couple of days. Supposedly due to the “out of memory” failures again although it does not look like the server ever exceeded 60% usage of memory during the scan. I backed off the thread count some and have started the scan again (yesterday). I may add more memory again to the server depending on how it goes this time.

Thanks,
Kyle

Hey Kyle,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

  1.  Were getting the below error on the SEEK System Scan

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Error during processing:  Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SQLite, Version=1.0.117.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)

  1.  Updated the Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on to v11.6.0.13 --this did not fix our error
  2.  Found where the System.Data.SQLite.dll v1.0.117.0 was in the %SAInstallDir%FSAA folder and replaced the 3 outdated System.Data.SQLite.dll v0.0.96 files with it --this fixed our SEEK error
  3.  Ran into a new issue where we were unable to run the SEEK group from the Schedules node

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   We added the svc_stealthbits account to the Settings > Schedule node to be used for Scheduled Tasks
     *   We recreated the SEEK group scheduled task and were then able to see the task successfully kick off

I'll open and close a ticket for the processing error we fixed today (no action required!) and leave this ticket open until we hear back from you on how the SEEK scan finishes.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hey Kyle,

Just spoke with our Product Manager for NEA and he mentioned that this issue was also present with another customer and that the results of testing/investigation should be Monday when the sprint ends. I’ll let you know what the results are as soon as I get them and what the plans are for fix/QA testing.

John,

Do you think development is going to release a fix to resolve this? Would be curious to at least know if they are able to repeat the issue. I was tempted to try and throw more cpu/memory resources at the server again. I don’t want to waste time and resources though, if there is a bug or issue (kind of seems that way since we did not appear to be fully consuming system resources). I don’t think we have had a full sensitive data scan work since our upgrade at the end of July.

Thanks,

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for checking for me. I'm working on getting this escalated to development.

Please navigate to the SEEK Scan job's properties and make sure the log level is set to DEBUG. It defaults to WARNING, and I can't remember if we changed it to DEBUG already.

The exact structure of your Job tree is likely different, but you need to right-click on the SEEK System Scan job and click Properties.
[cid:image002.png@01DB3C01.4AC88250]



Is the Log Level already set to DEBUG?

[cid:image003.png@01DB3C01.4AC88250]


If not, please set it to DEBUG, save, then run the job again.
Once the job fails, export the Job (include all job components) and attach the .zip to the ticket:

[cid:image004.png@01DB3C01.4AC88250]

If the Log Level was already set to DEBUG, you skip straight to exporting the job.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000FzXWI:ref
It is a virtual machine. However, I confirmed with our system admin that the hypervisor is not running low memory (that host is only using 40% of 2TB RAM with 100% allocation to vm guests – plenty of headroom there). So I don’t think that is the issue.

Thanks,
Kyle

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for that data. Is your application server a virtual machine? We've seen this behavior before where the application throws out of memory errors even though the server shows low RAM utilization. It turned out that the Hypervisor was running out of RAM.

If it is a virtual machine, please check the available RAM on the hypervisor.

Thank you,

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry to see the page file didn't help. There is something else to look at. Could you please run a PowerShell command for me, then attach the output?

Run PowerShell as an administrator and navigate to Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory. Default directory: ""C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDIT""

Run the command:
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter ""system.data.sqlite.dll"" | Format-List -property *version* > SQLiteVersion.txt

It should create a file in Netwrix Enterprise Auditor's install directory called SQLiteVersion.txt
It will look something like this:

[cid:image005.png@01DB3C01.4AC88250]

Please attach that file to the ticket. I want to see which FileVersions are listed.

Thank you,

The scan failed again. Same out of memory error messages. I checked and the memory consumption did not appear to go over 40%.

Good deal. I have taken these actions, rebooted and have a new scan running.

Hello Kyle,

I'm sorry; I misspoke. You are correct that the SQL server is not likely in play here.

Regarding the page file, I double checked with a senior engineer, and we recommend having the page file configured so that it only uses one drive. The issue seems to be that Windows does a poor job splitting the page file across multiple drives.
Disable ""Automatically manage paging file for all drive""
Set whichever drive is the largest or typically has the most free-space to ""System managed size""
Set the other drive to ""No paging file""
Reboot the server for the change to take effect

[cid:image006.png@01DB3C01.4AC88250]

The new error, ""...illegal operation attempted on a registry key that has been marked for deletion"" typically just means you need to reboot the server. If you make the page file change, you need to reboot anyway.

I know each of these scan attempts takes days to finish/fail. I'm sorry for the hassle, but please let me know if this helps.

Thank you,

Joshua Sexton

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000FzXWI:ref
The page file is currently set to let the system automatically manage the size. Would you suggest we change that to a static limit?  You also mentioned that the SQL server might be running out of memory? I assumed the SEEK scan was primarily using the local Tier 2 SQLite database until the bulk import is ran?

The scan did end up failing again after several days, this time different errors. I’ve attached the log.

Hello Kyle,

Thank you for the update. The logs made it look like an issue with memory on the SQL server, but it could be the page file instead. Are you able to check and potentially increase the page file maximum size? You can also allow the page file to use an additional drive, if there's one to use.

Start > Run > systempropertiesperformance.exe > Advanced > Change
[cid:image008.png@01DB3C01.4AC88250]
changing this will require a reboot

Please let me know how it goes.

Thank you,

The scan ended up failing again after a couple of days. Supposedly due to the “out of memory” failures again although it does not look like the server ever exceeded 60% usage of memory during the scan. I backed off the thread count some and have started the scan again (yesterday). I may add more memory again to the server depending on how it goes this time.

Thanks,
Kyle

Hey Kyle,

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

  1.  Were getting the below error on the SEEK System Scan

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Error during processing:  Could not load file or assembly 'System.Data.SQLite, Version=1.0.117.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)

  1.  Updated the Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on to v11.6.0.13 --this did not fix our error
  2.  Found where the System.Data.SQLite.dll v1.0.117.0 was in the %SAInstallDir%FSAA folder and replaced the 3 outdated System.Data.SQLite.dll v0.0.96 files with it --this fixed our SEEK error
  3.  Ran into a new issue where we were unable to run the SEEK group from the Schedules node

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   We added the svc_stealthbits account to the Settings > Schedule node to be used for Scheduled Tasks
     *   We recreated the SEEK group scheduled task and were then able to see the task successfully kick off

I'll open and close a ticket for the processing error we fixed today (no action required!) and leave this ticket open until we hear back from you on how the SEEK scan finishes.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri
