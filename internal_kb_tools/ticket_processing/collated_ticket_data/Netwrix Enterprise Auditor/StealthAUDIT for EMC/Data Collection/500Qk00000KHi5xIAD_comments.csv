@WaitingOnEngineer @Helen Randall  - it seems like the customer may have some old binaries that shouldn't be there anymore. A simple reboot may fix this but if not:

The customer should take the following steps:

	 - 	Uninstall the NEA console 
	 - 	Re-boot the server 
	 - 	Re-install the NEA console 
 
This will make sure it's a full, clean, uninstall and should resolve the issue.

@Salesforce @WaitingOnEngineer Could we please get new application logs for the same time the job was run (or a new set of both if we can't get those). Since the application was clean installed, we will need new app logs as well. Thanks

If the install date was 1/21, then the job specific debug logs uploaded on the 1/24 are incorrect, as these show timestamps of 1/9. Could you please submit job specific debug logs after from after the install, showing the issue occurring again? Thanks.

@WaitingOnEngineer
Hi - Could you please check on the settings for this scheduled task, specifically the ""Stop the task if it runs for..."" setting. It should be set to a default of 3 days (this is under 'Options'). The scan task was 38.7% through in 3 days last time, so it may need upped significantly. Can you have the customer try upping this value for this job and seeing if this resolves the issue. Thanks!
