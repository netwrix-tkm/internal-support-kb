I am having an issue with my Seek jobs. I am getting a database error. 

See Error Below
Error during processing:  Could not load file or assembly '<a href='https://System.Data' target='_blank'>System.Data</a>.SQLite, Version=1.0.117.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=db937bc2d44ff139' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)","","Per prior cases this is a known bug","Apply Knowledge SEEK System Scan Error:  Could Not Load File or Assembly

Linked to Escalation Ticket Number  00427172.

Awaiting log dump.","Noted the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)    11.6.0.111
NEA Sensitive Data (SDD)                                                                11.6.0.13

Per the Knowledge SEEK System Scan Error:  Could Not Load File or Assembly

We ran the following to find the incorrect .dll
Clear-Host
Set-Location $env:SAINSTALLDIR
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter ""system.data.sqlite.dll"" | Format-List -property *version*

With that we were able to then copy the correct 1.0.117.0 system.data.sqlite.dll file under  E:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITAgentNET40  and place is into E:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDITFSAA which had 1.0.110.0

The noted file was not update during the last patch, R&D is looking into this.

Our workaround should correct for the next FileSystem SEEK scan.

Contacts last email:
Ran a 0 depth scan just to try it out and it was success. It is currently doing a bulk import. I assume there was probably data that was not imported the last time, due to the issues we were having. It seems to be importing that data now.  So far, itâ€™s been bulk importing for about 4 hours with no errors.","Product defect","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for EMC","Data Collection","11.6","111","21.0","Closed - Resolved","Point32Health Services, Inc.","Peter Sterianos","2024-11-27T14:27:57.000Z","2024-12-18T14:37:09.000Z"
