* What is the SEEK > right-click properties > Performance Threads set to?

* I believe they currently have the SEEK query setting set:
Number of SDD Processes: 6

* The doc below mentions:
""NOTE: If running Sensitive Data Discovery (SDD) scans, it will be necessary to increase the minimum amount of RAM. Each thread requires a minimum of 2 additional GB of RAM per host. By default, SDD scans are configured to run two concurrent threads. For example, if the job is configured to scan 8 hosts at a time with two concurrent SDD threads, then an extra 32 GB of RAM are required (8x2x2=32).""

Were getting the below error on the SEEK System Scan

Updated the Netwrix Sensitive Data Discovery Add-on to v11.6.0.13 --this did not fix our error

Found where the System.Data.SQLite.dll v1.0.117.0 was in the %SAInstallDir%FSAA folder and replaced the 3 outdated System.Data.SQLite.dll v0.0.96 files with it --this fixed our SEEK error

Ran into a new issue where we were unable to run the SEEK group from the Schedules node

added the svc_stealthbits account to the Settings > Schedule node to be used for Scheduled Tasks

 recreated the SEEK group scheduled task and were then able to see the task successfully kick off","0054u000007oss5AAA","2024-10-08T14:30:56.000Z","2024-10-08T14:30:56.000Z","false","false"
