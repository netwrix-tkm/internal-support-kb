@Salesforce @Chris Brooks @Ethan Israel  I've tried replicating this in house but I can't seem to trigger this error with just an older version of System.Data.SQLite.dll. The version number of 1.0.110 hasn't been in use for NEA since 9.0 (Based on my review of the code history). So there may just be a lot of outdated binaries in the customer's FSAA folder, besides System.Data.SQLite that were just never cleaned up over the years.  System.Data.SQLite.dll isn't even required in the root of FSAA anymore (it is required in FSAASensitiveData)

The plan of attack for development is to mark any of these old files as obsolete in the code, so that FSAA will remove them prior to scanning, which should prevent any further issues. But in order to do that we need to see exactly what's in the customer's directory.

 Is it possible to provide a zip of the FSAA folder and the FSAASensitiveData folder containing all the binaries? (You don't have to provide tier 2s or logs)
