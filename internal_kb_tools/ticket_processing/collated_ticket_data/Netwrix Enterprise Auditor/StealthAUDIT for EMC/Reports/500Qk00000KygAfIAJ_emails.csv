Hi Tay,

We’re still having issues with this. When you have a moment, could you please send a link to schedule meeting to discuss with our Open Systems team the servers that were remediated but still showing on the report?

Thank you.

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

	Reviewed the current Open Access report, which showed 1 open share on CARVSQLRDSMS003
	Found that the FSAA_Exceptions job for CARVSQLRDSMS003 which analyzes the collected scan data had not been run post 1/28 due to being disabled
	Kicked off the FSAA_Exceptions job via the schedule -- this completed successfully


Once you've had a chance to rerun the Open Access report, let me know if that remediated share still shows or if we're all good to go.

Thank you,

I'm happy to hear CARVSQLRDSMS003 is no longer showing on the open access report. For ADCVUTLPACMS100, do you know when that is slated to run next so we can validate it's fixed as well?
