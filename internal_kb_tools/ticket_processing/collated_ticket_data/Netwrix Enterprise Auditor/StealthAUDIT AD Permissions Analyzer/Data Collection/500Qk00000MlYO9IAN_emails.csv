Thanks for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Gonzalo Martinez and I will assist you with the case.

We have reports related to user information on the State in time folder for active directory. User information and user activity are separate. User Accounts - Attributes will bring the user data. 






If you need to know what activity the account does, you can use the Search Activity tool to search the account activity.



Let me know if you need anything else.

Best regards.
