1) As a test, can we use a Domain Admin cred on the ADPA Collection jobs --does this throw the same error?

2) I would like to see evidence/screenshots that the POCNetwrix account has at least the following permissions on the root of the domain/all AD objects

Read permissions
LDAP Read

3) Also might not hurt to try and run the attached PS script as POCNetwrix from the NEA console server --does this succeed?
