@Michael Burrofato @Carlos Mejia @Salesforce They had some fields in AD that  seemed to be returning as the incorrect type. This should be an extremely unlikely occurrance, so when we get some logs from a successful run I can take a look at them to learn more.

@Carlos Mejia @Salesforce I checked it out for a little bit but didn't find any reason why their setup would cause the problem. It's probably an issue in the .NET LDAP libraries.
