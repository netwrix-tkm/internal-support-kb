I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful. 

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:
 

	Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution

Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well. 

ADPermissions Data Collector

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Thank you,

Hi Scotty



  *   Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:
     *   MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics
        *   As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
        *   Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv”
           *   The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine
           *   I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs.
              *   If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.
  *   Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together
     *   Check the logs
  *   If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful.

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:


  *   Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm>
Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well.

ADPermissions Data Collector<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ADPermissions/Overview.htm>

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty 

 

 


	Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:
	
		MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics

		
			As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
			Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv” 
			
				The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine 
				I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs. 
				
					If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.
				
				
			
			
		
		
	
	
	Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together 
	
		Check the logs 
	
	
	If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful. 

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:
 


	Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution


Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well. 

ADPermissions Data Collector

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Hi Mike

This is great information you have identifies and provided.

However, what I don’t understand tis that using the same account ""LEWISpocnetwrix""  as explained before is able to perform the following


  *   AD Inventory
  *   File System
We have no errors on those jobs

For me and again for the many times we have explained it’s a DB Error. Please check the logs as you have requested.

We are wating time by checking the access of the account from what o cam see

Added my Nest @Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> who might be able to help

Hi Mike

Thanks for sharing the information below.

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

[cid:image001.png@01DB9DAD.A05F1310]

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

[cid:image002.png@01DB9DAD.A05F1310]


I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before.


I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty



  1.  Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:

     *   MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics

        *   As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
        *   Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv”

           *   The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine
           *   I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs.

              *   If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.

  1.  Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together

     *   Check the logs

  1.  If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful.

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:


  1.  Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm>
Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well.

ADPermissions Data Collector<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ADPermissions/Overview.htm>

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Thank you,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful. 

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:
 


	Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution


Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well. 

ADPermissions Data Collector

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Thank you,

Hi Brandon


  *   Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?
     *   MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report
  *   By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.
     *   MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
        *   Such as this delegated permission
           *   [Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB.

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs.

@Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know @Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Hi Mike

Thanks for sharing the information below.

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

[cid:image001.png@01DB9E99.6B7C8870]

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

[cid:image002.png@01DB9E99.6B7C8870]


I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before.


I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty



  1.  Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:

  1.

     *   MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics

  1.

     *

        *   As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
        *   Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv”

  1.

     *

        *

           *   The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine
           *   I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs.

  1.

     *

        *

           *

              *   If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.

  1.  Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together

  1.

     *   Check the logs

  1.  If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hi Mark

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer.htm>

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:
Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/PermissionMatrix.htm>

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)

  *   ADSI
  *   LDAP
  *   RPC

  *   TCP 389
  *   TCP 135 – 139
  *   Randomly allocated high TCP ports

  *   LDAP Read permissions
  *   Read on all AD objects
  *   Read permissions on all AD Objects

Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Brandon


  *   Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?
     *   MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report
  *   By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.
     *   MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
        *   Such as this delegated permission
           *   [Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB.

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs.

@Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know @Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Thank you,

Hi Mike

Thanks for sharing the information below.

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

[cid:image008.png@01DB9FFF.D6DCC0F0]

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

[cid:image009.png@01DB9FFF.D6DCC0F0]


I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before.


I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty



  1.  Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:

  1.

     *   MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics

  1.

     *

        *   As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
        *   Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv”

  1.

     *

        *

           *   The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine
           *   I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs.

  1.

     *

        *

           *

              *   If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.

  1.  Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together

  1.

     *   Check the logs

  1.  If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful.

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:


  1.  Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm>
Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well.

ADPermissions Data Collector<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ADPermissions/Overview.htm>

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Hi Alex

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued.

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:

[cid:image008.png@01DBA242.F9FC89E0]

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has

[cid:image009.png@01DBA242.F9FC89E0]

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below.

[Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.


Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244


  *   In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for.

  *   The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine.

  *   If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans.

  *   The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Farrah Gamboa<mailto:farrah.gamboa@netwrix.com> I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect?

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error”

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now 😊

Help Please 😊

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer.htm>

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)

  *   ADSI
  *   LDAP
  *   RPC

  *   TCP 389
  *   TCP 135 – 139
  *   Randomly allocated high TCP ports

  *   LDAP Read permissions
  *   Read on all AD objects
  *   Read permissions on all AD Objects

  *   Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?
     *   MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report
  *   By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.
     *   MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
        *   Such as this delegated permission
           *   [Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB.

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs.

@Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know @Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Thank you,

Hi Mike

Thanks for sharing the information below.

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

[cid:image002.png@01DBA241.FEBACAB0]

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

[cid:image003.png@01DBA241.FEBACAB0]


I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before.


I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty



  1.  Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:

  1.

     *   MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics

  1.

     *

        *   As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
        *   Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv”

  1.

     *

        *

           *   The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine
           *   I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs.

  1.

     *

        *

           *

              *   If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.

  1.  Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together

  1.

     *   Check the logs

  1.  If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful.

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:


  1.  Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm>
Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well.

ADPermissions Data Collector<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ADPermissions/Overview.htm>

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Hi Mark,

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev.

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don’t believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244
17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging.

Hi Alex

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued.

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:


[cid:image008.png@01DBA234.01ED0030]

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has

[cid:image009.png@01DBA234.01ED0030]

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below.

[Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.


Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244

  *   In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for.
  *   The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine.
  *   If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans.
  *   The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Farrah Gamboa<mailto:farrah.gamboa@netwrix.com> I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect?

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error”

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now 😊

Help Please 😊

Hi Mark

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer.htm>

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:
Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/PermissionMatrix.htm>

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)

  *   ADSI
  *   LDAP
  *   RPC

  *   TCP 389
  *   TCP 135 – 139
  *   Randomly allocated high TCP ports

  *   LDAP Read permissions
  *   Read on all AD objects
  *   Read permissions on all AD Objects

Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Brandon


  *   Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?
     *   MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report
  *   By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.
     *   MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
        *   Such as this delegated permission
           *   [Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB.

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs.

@Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know @Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Thank you,

Hi Mike

Thanks for sharing the information below.

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

[cid:image011.png@01DBA234.01ED0030]

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

[cid:image012.png@01DBA234.01ED0030]


I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before.


I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty



  1.  Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:

  1.

     *   MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics

  1.

     *

        *   As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
        *   Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv”

  1.

     *

        *

           *   The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine
           *   I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs.

  1.

     *

        *

           *

              *   If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.

  1.  Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together

  1.

     *   Check the logs

  1.  If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful.

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:


  1.  Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm>
Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well.

ADPermissions Data Collector<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ADPermissions/Overview.htm>

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Hi Mark,

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev.

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don’t believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244
17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging.

Hi Alex

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued.

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:


[cid:image001.png@01DBA3CF.504664F0]

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has

[cid:image002.png@01DBA3CF.504664F0]

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below.

[Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.


Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244

  *   In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for.
  *   The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine.
  *   If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans.
  *   The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Farrah Gamboa<mailto:farrah.gamboa@netwrix.com> I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect?

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error”

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now 😊

Help Please 😊

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #439010 - - NEA Permission Analyzer Job Errors [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0N1Fsf:ref ]

Hi Mark

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer.htm>

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:
Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/PermissionMatrix.htm>

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)

  *   ADSI
  *   LDAP
  *   RPC

  *   TCP 389
  *   TCP 135 – 139
  *   Randomly allocated high TCP ports

  *   LDAP Read permissions
  *   Read on all AD objects
  *   Read permissions on all AD Objects

Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Brandon


  *   Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?
     *   MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report
  *   By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.
     *   MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
        *   Such as this delegated permission
           *   [Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB.

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs.

@Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know @Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Thank you,

Hi Mike

Thanks for sharing the information below.

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

[cid:image004.png@01DBA3CF.504664F0]

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

[cid:image005.png@01DBA3CF.504664F0]


I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before.


I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty



  1.  Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:

  1.

     *   MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics

  1.

     *

        *   As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
        *   Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv”

  1.

     *

        *

           *   The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine
           *   I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs.

  1.

     *

        *

           *

              *   If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.

  1.  Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together

  1.

     *   Check the logs

  1.  If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful.

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:


  1.  Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm>
Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well.

ADPermissions Data Collector<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ADPermissions/Overview.htm>

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Hi Mark,

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev.

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don’t believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244
17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging.


Thanks,
Farrah Gamboa

Hi Alex

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued.

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:


[cid:image001.png@01DBA3C8.02E37790]

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has

[cid:image002.png@01DBA3C8.02E37790]

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below.

[Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.


Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244

  *   In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for.
  *   The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine.
  *   If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans.
  *   The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.

@Farrah Gamboa<mailto:farrah.gamboa@netwrix.com> I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect?

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error”

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now 😊

Help Please 😊

Hi Mark

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer.htm>

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:
Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/PermissionMatrix.htm>

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)

  *   ADSI
  *   LDAP
  *   RPC

  *   TCP 389
  *   TCP 135 – 139
  *   Randomly allocated high TCP ports

  *   LDAP Read permissions
  *   Read on all AD objects
  *   Read permissions on all AD Objects

Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Brandon


  *   Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

     *   MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report

  *   By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.

     *   MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.

        *   Such as this delegated permission

           *   [Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB.

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs.

@Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know @Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Hi Mike

Thanks for sharing the information below.

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

[cid:image004.png@01DBA3C8.02E37790]

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

[cid:image005.png@01DBA3C8.02E37790]


I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before.


I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty



  1.  Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:

  1.

     *   MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics

  1.

     *

        *   As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
        *   Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv”

  1.

     *

        *

           *   The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine
           *   I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs.

  1.

     *

        *

           *

              *   If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.

  1.  Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together

  1.

     *   Check the logs

  1.  If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful.

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:


  1.  Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm>
Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well.

ADPermissions Data Collector<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ADPermissions/Overview.htm>

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Hi Mark,

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev.

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don’t believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244
17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging.


Thanks,

Hi Alex

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued.

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:


[cid:image001.png@01DBA484.06C51820]

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has

[cid:image002.png@01DBA484.06C51820]

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below.

[Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.


Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244

  *   In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for.
  *   The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine.
  *   If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans.
  *   The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Farrah Gamboa<mailto:farrah.gamboa@netwrix.com> I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect?

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error”

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now 😊

Help Please 😊

Hi Mark

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer.htm>

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:
Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/PermissionMatrix.htm>

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)

  *   ADSI
  *   LDAP
  *   RPC

  *   TCP 389
  *   TCP 135 – 139
  *   Randomly allocated high TCP ports

  *   LDAP Read permissions
  *   Read on all AD objects
  *   Read permissions on all AD Objects

Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Brandon


  *   Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

     *   MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report

  *   By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.

     *   MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.

        *   Such as this delegated permission

           *   [Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB.

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs.

@Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know @Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Hi Mike

Thanks for sharing the information below.

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

[cid:image004.png@01DBA484.06C51820]

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

[cid:image005.png@01DBA484.06C51820]


I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before.


I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty



  1.  Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:

  1.

     *   MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics

  1.

     *

        *   As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
        *   Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv”

  1.

     *

        *

           *   The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine
           *   I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs.

  1.

     *

        *

           *

              *   If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.

  1.  Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together

  1.

     *   Check the logs

  1.  If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful.

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:


  1.  Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm>
Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well.

ADPermissions Data Collector<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ADPermissions/Overview.htm>

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Hi Mark,

 

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev. 

 

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don’t believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244

17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

 

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging. 

 

 


Thanks,

Farrah Gamboa

Hi Alex

 

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued. 

 

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:

 

 



 

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has 

 



 

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below. 

 



 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.  

 

 

Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244


	In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for. 
	The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine. 
	If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans. 
	The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

@Farrah Gamboa I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect? 

 

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error” 

 

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now 😊 

 

Help Please  😊 

 

My Best

Hi Mark

 

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

 

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

 

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:

Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)

 

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)



	
		
			
			
				ADSI
				LDAP
				RPC
			
			
			
			
				TCP 389
				TCP 135 – 139
				Randomly allocated high TCP ports
			
			
			
			
				LDAP Read permissions
				Read on all AD objects
				Read permissions on all AD Objects

Hi Brandon

 


	Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?



	
	
		MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report
	
	



	By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.



	
	
		MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
	
	



	
	
		
		
			Such as this delegated permission
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				
			
			
		
		
	
	


 

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB. 

 

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs. 

 

@Alexander Buchta My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know  @Alexander Buchta you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Hi Mike

 

Thanks for sharing the information below.

 

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

 

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

 



 

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

 



 

 

I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before. 

 

 

I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty 

 

 


	Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:



	 



	
	
		MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
			Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv” 
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine 
				I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs. 
			
			
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				 
			
			
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				
				
					If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.
				
				
			
			
		
		
	
	



	Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together 



	 



	
	
		Check the logs 
	
	



	If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful. 

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:
 


	Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution


Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well. 

ADPermissions Data Collector

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Thank you,

Hi Mark,

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev.

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don’t believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244
17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging.


Thanks,
Farrah Gamboa

Hi Alex

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued.

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:


[cid:image001.png@01DBA56C.82BA4CA0]

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has

[cid:image002.png@01DBA56C.82BA4CA0]

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below.

[Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.


Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244

  1.  In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for.
  2.  The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine.
  3.  If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans.
  4.  The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Farrah Gamboa<mailto:farrah.gamboa@netwrix.com> I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect?

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error”

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now 😊

Help Please 😊

My Best

Hi Mark

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer.htm>

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:
Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/PermissionMatrix.htm>

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)

  1.  ADSI
  2.  LDAP
  3.  RPC

  1.  TCP 389
  2.  TCP 135 – 139
  3.  Randomly allocated high TCP ports

  1.  LDAP Read permissions
  2.  Read on all AD objects
  3.  Read permissions on all AD Objects

Thank you,
Alex Buchta
Technical Support Manager

Hi Brandon


  1.  Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?
·

     *   MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report

  1.  By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.
·

     *   MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
·
o

        *   Such as this delegated permission
·
o
§

           *   [Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB.

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs.

@Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know @Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Hi Mike

Thanks for sharing the information below.

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

[cid:image004.png@01DBA56C.82BA4CA0]

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

[cid:image005.png@01DBA56C.82BA4CA0]


I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before.


I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty



  1.  Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:

        *   As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
        *   Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv”

Subject: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #439010 - - NEA Permission Analyzer Job Errors [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0N1Fsf:ref ]

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful.

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:


  1.  Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm>
Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well.

ADPermissions Data Collector<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ADPermissions/Overview.htm>

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Thank you,

Hi Mark,

 

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev. 

 

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don’t believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244

17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

 

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging. 

 

 


Thanks,

Farrah Gamboa

Hi Alex

 

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued. 

 

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:

 

 



 

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has 

 



 

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below. 

 



 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.  

 

 

Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244


	In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for. 
	The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine. 
	If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans. 
	The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

@Farrah Gamboa I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect? 

 

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error”  

 

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now 😊 

 

Help Please 😊 

 

My Best

Hi Mark

 

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

 

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

 

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:

Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)

 

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)



	
		
			
			
				ADSI
				LDAP
				RPC
			
			
			
			
				TCP 389
				TCP 135 – 139
				Randomly allocated high TCP ports
			
			
			
			
				LDAP Read permissions
				Read on all AD objects
				Read permissions on all AD Objects
			
			
		
	



 

Thank you,

Hi Brandon

 


	Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?


·         


	
	
		MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report
	
	



	By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.


·         


	
	
		MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
	
	


·         

o    


	
	
		
		
			Such as this delegated permission
		
		
	
	


·         

o    

§   


	
	
		
		
			
			
				
			
			
		
		
	
	


 

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB. 

 

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs. 

 

@Alexander Buchta My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know  @Alexander Buchta you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Hi Mike

 

Thanks for sharing the information below.

 

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

 

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

 



 

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

 



 

 

I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before. 

 

 

I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824
20/03/2025 16:00:02    INFO    StealthAUDIT    TConnectionMgr.RecordConnectionResults    ""LEWDC001pocnetwrixACCESS DENIED profile: Netwrix Scanning Account""            -1    13152    10824
+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty 

 

 


	Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:



	 



	 



	
	
		MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
			Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv” 
		
		
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine 
				I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs. 
			
			
		
		
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				 
			
			
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				 
			
			
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				
				
					If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.
				
				
			
			
		
		
	
	



	Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together 



	 



	 



	
	
		Check the logs 
	
	



	If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful. 

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:
 


	Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution


Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well. 

ADPermissions Data Collector

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Thank you,

Hi Mark,

 

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev. 

 

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don’t believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244

17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

 

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging. 

 

 


Thanks,

Farrah Gamboa

Hi Alex

 

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued. 

 

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:

 

 



 

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has 

 



 

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below. 

 



 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.  

 

 

Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244


	In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for. 
	The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine. 
	If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans. 
	The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

@Farrah Gamboa I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect? 

 

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error”  

 

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now 😊 

 

Help Please 😊 

 

My Best

Hi Mark

 

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

 

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

 

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:

Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)

 

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)



	
		
			
			
				ADSI
				LDAP
				RPC
			
			
			
			
				TCP 389
				TCP 135 – 139
				Randomly allocated high TCP ports
			
			
			
			
				LDAP Read permissions
				Read on all AD objects
				Read permissions on all AD Objects

Hi Brandon

 


	Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?


·         


	
	
		MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report
	
	



	By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.


·         


	
	
		MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
	
	


·         

o    


	
	
		
		
			Such as this delegated permission
		
		
	
	


·         

o    

§   


	
	
		
		
			
			
				
			
			
		
		
	
	


 

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB. 

 

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs. 

 

@Alexander Buchta My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know  @Alexander Buchta you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Hi Mike

 

Thanks for sharing the information below.

 

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

 

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

 



 

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

 



 

 

I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before. 

 

 

I am note sure what else I can do on my side. 

 

 


Kind Regards

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.



Thank you,

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824
20/03/2025 16:00:02    INFO    StealthAUDIT    TConnectionMgr.RecordConnectionResults    ""LEWDC001pocnetwrixACCESS DENIED profile: Netwrix Scanning Account""            -1    13152    10824
+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty 

 

 


	Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:



	 



	 



	
	
		MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
			Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv” 
		
		
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine 
				I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs. 
			
			
		
		
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				 
			
			
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				 
			
			
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				
				
					If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.
				
				
			
			
		
		
	
	



	Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together 



	 



	 



	
	
		Check the logs 
	
	



	If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful. 

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:
 


	Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution


Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well. 

ADPermissions Data Collector

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Thank you,

Any chance we can have you use the same account that we have set on your Active Directory Inventory job group?

That should have all the rights needed for the Permissions Analyzer.

I can send an invite out for a quick meeting for clarification if you'd like.

Can you also send a screenshot of the license? Just by going to Help / About.

Hi Ziyaad,

This is from your email to the other case - 438927.
I am going to assign this case to you as well - 439010.

With regards to the permission analyzer job we are still not successful with scanning even though we have a connection profile configured with elevated permissions (same cred we used to run weak password job). Please see error below:

Hi Mark,

 

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev. 

 

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don’t believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244

17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

 

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging. 

 

 


Thanks,

Farrah Gamboa

Hi Alex

 

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued. 

 

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:

 

 



 

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has 

 



 

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below. 

 



 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.  

 

 

Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244


	In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for. 
	The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine. 
	If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans. 
	The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

@Farrah Gamboa I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect? 

 

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error”  

 

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now 😊 

 

Help Please 😊 

 

My Best

Hi Mark

 

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

 

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

 

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:

Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)

 

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)



	
		
			
			
				ADSI
				LDAP
				RPC
			
			
			
			
				TCP 389
				TCP 135 – 139
				Randomly allocated high TCP ports
			
			
			
			
				LDAP Read permissions
				Read on all AD objects
				Read permissions on all AD Objects

Hi Brandon

 


	Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?


·         


	
	
		MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report
	
	



	By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.


·         


	
	
		MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
	
	


·         

o    


	
	
		
		
			Such as this delegated permission
		
		
	
	


·         

o    

§   


	
	
		
		
			
			
				
			
			
		
		
	
	


 

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB. 

 

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs. 

 

@Alexander Buchta My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know  @Alexander Buchta you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?


Thank you,

Hi Mike

 

Thanks for sharing the information below.

 

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

 

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

 



 

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

 



 

 

I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before. 

 

 

I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.



Thank you,

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty 

 

 


	Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:



	 



	 



	
	
		MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
			Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv” 
		
		
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine 
				I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs. 
			
			
		
		
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				 
			
			
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				 
			
			
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				
				
					If you know how NEA works None of those jobs would have worked unless we had a BASE AD Inventory Scan had worked.
				
				
			
			
		
		
	
	



	Please read the provided Word Document I provided put the pieces together 



	 



	 



	
	
		Check the logs 
	
	



	If anything if you are still unsure suggest a online session to ee things yourself

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful. 

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:
 


	Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution


Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well. 

ADPermissions Data Collector

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

Thank you,

I know we did testing with a higher level account as well as the standard account.

Any chance we can have you use the same account that we have set on your Active Directory Inventory job group?

That should have all the rights needed for the Permissions Analyzer.

I can send an invite out for a quick meeting for clarification if you'd like.

Can you also send a screenshot of the license? Just by going to Help / About.

Thanks,

Hi Ziyaad,

This is from your email to the other case - 438927.
I am going to assign this case to you as well - 439010.

With regards to the permission analyzer job we are still not successful with scanning even though we have a connection profile configured with elevated permissions (same cred we used to run weak password job). Please see error below:

Hi Mark,

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev.

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don't believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244
17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging.

Hi Alex

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued.

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:


[cid:image002.png@01DBAA6F.2436BB20]

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has

[cid:image003.png@01DBAA6F.2436BB20]

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don't need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like ""Weak Password"" scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below.

[Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.


Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244

  1.  In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can't login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for.
  2.  The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine.
  3.  If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans.
  4.  The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@Farrah Gamboa<mailto:farrah.gamboa@netwrix.com> I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect?

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can't do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open ""00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error""

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now ?

Help Please ?

Hi Mark

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer.htm>

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:
Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/PermissionMatrix.htm>

It does appear to be ""Read permission"" however there is more than just ""Domain user"". If you haven't already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)

  1.  ADSI
  2.  LDAP
  3.  RPC

  1.  TCP 389
  2.  TCP 135 - 139
  3.  Randomly allocated high TCP ports

  1.  LDAP Read permissions
  2.  Read on all AD objects
  3.  Read permissions on all AD Objects

Thank you,
Alex Buchta
Technical Support Manager

Hi Brandon


  1.  Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?
1.

  1.

     *   MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report

  1.  By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.
1.

  1.

     *   MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the ""NEA AD Job Module"" which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.

           *   [Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated]

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB.

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs.

@Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know @Alexander Buchta<mailto:Alexander.Buchta@netwrix.com> you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the ""Read"" for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Hi Mike

Thanks for sharing the information below.

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the ""Read"" for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

Today I used Dupreez's account to run a scan using the ""AD Container Rights"" Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

[cid:image005.png@01DBAA6F.2436BB20]

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

[cid:image006.png@01DBAA6F.2436BB20]


I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before.


I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty



  1.  Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:

Hello Mark,

I've already reviewed the logs and the error messages are just a repeat instance of the error messages in the console with no additional information. If there is additional information in the screenshot in the word document than would be more helpful.

Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:


  1.  Recommended Configurations for AD Permissions Analyzer Solution<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm>
Additionally, I would also verify if the permission requirements are met for the account that's being used in the connection profile with the ADPermissions Data Collector. I have provided that documentation below as well.

ADPermissions Data Collector<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Admin/DataCollector/ADPermissions/Overview.htm>

Please let me know if they are still having issues after checking these settings and permissions.

I know we did testing with a higher level account as well as the standard account.

Any chance we can have you use the same account that we have set on your Active Directory Inventory job group?

That should have all the rights needed for the Permissions Analyzer.

I can send an invite out for a quick meeting for clarification if you'd like.

Can you also send a screenshot of the license? Just by going to Help / About. 

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hi Ziyaad,

This is from your email to the other case - 438927.
I am going to assign this case to you as well - 439010.

With regards to the permission analyzer job we are still not successful with scanning even though we have a connection profile configured with elevated permissions (same cred we used to run weak password job). Please see error below:

Hi Mark,

 

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev. 

 

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don’t believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244

17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

 

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging. 

 

 


Thanks,

Farrah Gamboa

Hi Alex

 

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued. 

 

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:

 

 



 

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has 

 



 

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below. 

 



 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.  

 

 

Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244


	In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for. 
	The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine. 
	If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans. 
	The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

@Farrah Gamboa I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect? 

 

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error”  

 

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now ? 

 

Help Please ? 

 

My Best

Hi Mark

 

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

 

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

 

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:

Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)

 

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)



	
		
			
			
				ADSI
				LDAP
				RPC
			
			
			
			
				TCP 389
				TCP 135 – 139
				Randomly allocated high TCP ports
			
			
			
			
				LDAP Read permissions
				Read on all AD objects
				Read permissions on all AD Objects
			
			
		
	



 

Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Brandon

 


	Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?


1.        


	 



	
	
		MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report
	
	



	By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.


1.        


	 



	
	
		MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
	
	


1.        

1.        


	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			Such as this delegated permission
		
		
	
	


1.        

1.        

1.        


	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				
			
			
		
		
	
	


 

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB. 

 

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs. 

 

@Alexander Buchta My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know  @Alexander Buchta you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Hi Mike

 

Thanks for sharing the information below.

 

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

 

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

 



 

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

 



 

 

I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before. 

 

 

I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

+++++
20/03/2025 16:41:12    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13012    12984

Hi Scotty 

 

 


	Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics
	
	



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”

I know we did testing with a higher level account as well as the standard account.

Any chance we can have you use the same account that we have set on your Active Directory Inventory job group?

That should have all the rights needed for the Permissions Analyzer.

I can send an invite out for a quick meeting for clarification if you'd like.

Can you also send a screenshot of the license? Just by going to Help / About. 

Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hi Ziyaad,

This is from your email to the other case - 438927.
I am going to assign this case to you as well - 439010.

With regards to the permission analyzer job we are still not successful with scanning even though we have a connection profile configured with elevated permissions (same cred we used to run weak password job). Please see error below:

Hi Mark,

 

Before I offer my hypothesis, I want to say that my recommendation to avoid confusion and get the feedback you need is to get this case escalated so we can properly review and triage with dev. 

 

Now onto my hypothesis based on reviewing the logs in the support case: I don’t believe the issue is related to permissions persay, but it is definitely related to the connection profile credential based on this error message:

17/03/2025 15:35:31    DEBUG ADP                Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection                ""System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.GetConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.AD.Common.ActiveDirectoryProvider.get_ConnectionInfo()     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ADP.Tasks.PermissionTaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)     at Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.Common.TaskBase.CheckConnection(String host, NetworkCredential credential)""       LEWDC001        DCExtract          5452     8812     6244

17/03/2025 15:35:31    INFO     ADP       Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.DataCollectors.ExtractBase.CheckConnection                ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'.""              LEWDC001        DCExtract                5452     8812     6244

 

My hunch is that it is because maybe the credential has a double byte character as part of the password, and the ADPA data collector is not handling that correctly. This is just a hunch though and we should really get this escalated for proper development triaging. 

 

 


Thanks,

Farrah Gamboa

Hi Alex

 

Many Thanks as always for your input which is always valued. 

 

@Support We unfortunately seem to be going round in circles and not addressing the issue in hand. We have provided all the logs, checked triple checked the permissions for the service account (Which As Alex pointed out below) only needs read access, had support on calls, showed how we have run several other modules with no problem, but the AD Permission Analyzer is coming back with the following error:

 

 



 

Notice the ports are the same for the AD Inventory to run successfully of which it has 

 



 

This documentation is also incorrect as to run an AD Inventory ( We don’t need AD Domain Admin) Never needed it ever. This is the least privilege access approach for NEA. Yes there are jobs which require an elevated privilege like “Weak Password” scanning but even that we have a least privilege approach as displayed below. 

 



 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOW COMING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ERROR: Please see below the original description of the error which for me is Database related but yes I might be incorrect.  

 

 

Running a POC where all the NEA AD Permission Analyzer Collection Jobs report the same error
17/03/2025 15:36:12 ERROR ADP TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'"" LEWDC001 DCExtract 8904 8812 6244


	In the same POC I am able run FS, SP and File Systems jobs no problem. All reports are available with expectation we can’t login to the Published reports directory which we have another support case open for. 
	The MSSQL Database is US Version with a MSSQL Latin version on the collation and it looks fine. 
	If it was Collation problem, I would have seen that within the AD Inventory, FS and Sharepoint Online scans. 
	The AIC is working as expected but the NEA AD {Permission analyser jobs are throwing the same issue as displayed above.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

@Farrah Gamboa I really hate to bring you into this conversation and if I am incorrect, I am happy to be proved I am wrong. But if possible, can you shed some light and or confirm that my diagnosis is correct or incorrect? 

 

I really need to close down this POC and displace Varonis but I can’t do this until this is resolved alongside another support case I have open “00438927 - POC - NEA Published Reports :Internal Server Error”  

 

You are a bit of a last resort for me right now ? 

 

Help Please ? 

 

My Best

Hi Mark

 

I am not familiar with this particular case, and cannot recall all permissions. It is dependent on data collector.

 

Domain Target Requirements, Permissions, and Ports

 

My go to document to reference this for NEA was the Permissions by data collector Matrix:

Permissions by Data Collector (Matrix)

 

It does appear to be “Read permission” however there is more than just “Domain user”. If you haven’t already I would dig into all the other ports and permissions referenced to this data collector (RPC etc)



	
		
			
			
				ADSI
				LDAP
				RPC
			
			
			
			
				TCP 389
				TCP 135 – 139
				Randomly allocated high TCP ports
			
			
			
			
				LDAP Read permissions
				Read on all AD objects
				Read permissions on all AD Objects
			
			
		
	



 

Thank you,
Alex Buchta

Hi Brandon

 


	Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?


1.        


	 



	
	
		MR: Yes, this is correct for the AD Permission Analyzer job set. AD By Default / Design Provides all the required information for the NEA AD Job Permission Analyzer Jobs to run and provide the OOB Reports along with Domain Shadow Admin Access attack path report
	
	



	By our documentation, the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have Domain Administrator privilege.


1.        


	 



	
	
		MR: I think you might be including the Weak Password report which is potentially one of the only Jobs that run within the “NEA AD Job Module” which requires an elevated privilege such as Domain Admin and or another delegated Permission to be able to access the Hashes of the password.
	
	


1.        

1.        


	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			Such as this delegated permission
		
		
	
	


1.        

1.        

1.        


	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				
			
			
		
		
	
	


 

I have run the AD Permission analyser job for about 5 to 6 years ago from the days of SB. 

 

The issue is not the access account. The issue for me from what I can tell is the Database error that is being reported within all the 0.Collection AD Perm Scan jobs. 

 

@Alexander Buchta My Friend and Legend possible you can add some more assistance here. I know  @Alexander Buchta you are not that much technical these days but I am going round in circles on this one !

Hi Mark,

I'm not sure I understand your statment below ""As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.""

Are you under the impressions that the connection profile only needs membership as a Domain User?

By our documentation the AD Permissions Analyzer group requires to account used in the connection profile to have  Domain Administrator privilege.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Solutions/ActiveDirectoryPermissionsAnalyzer/Recommended.htm

""Connection Profile

Assign a Connection Profile at the Active Directory Permissions Analyzer > 0. Collection > Settings > Connection node with local Administrator privileges on the target host, or Domain Administrator privileges if the target host is a domain controller.""

Have I misunderstood your statement?

Hi Mike

 

Thanks for sharing the information below.

 

As I am sure you know when it comes to AD Permission Analyzer there is no special access account needed as all AD Permissions have the “Read” for Any Account created within the Active Directory.

 

Today I used Dupreez’s account to run a scan using the “AD Container Rights” Job just using his own account and again I get Access denied. Please see below and also see attached Log file for the scan.

 



 

I then used the same account to perform an AD Inventory, and it worked as expected. See screen shot below and, I have attached the Log file for that scan to the email.

 



 

 

I get we are using different Data Collectors between the 2 jobs, AD Inv is using LDAP and AD Perms is probably using PowerShell but I have not come across the error we are seeing in the AD Perms job before. 

 

 

I am note sure what else I can do on my side.

Hi Mark,

Searching for ""pocnetwrix"" using Notepad++ against all *.tsv logs reveals the same WARNING in all 7 logs.
I am still not sure if this is just a warning or if the ACCESS DENIED for the ""LEWISpocnetwrix"" account is the core issue.
You probably have a better idea than I do.

Hi Mark,

I imagine that I will find this in all 7 corresponding logs for the 7 jobs run today.
Is it a warning or is it actually saying that ACCESS is DENIED for the ""pocnetwrix"" account??
Pardon me if you have been saying this all along.

1) 5 lines before the ERROR in the ""AD_ComputerRights_Log.tsv"", I see an ACCESS DENIED warning:

+++++
20/03/2025 16:00:02    WARNING    StealthAUDIT    THostConnection.RecordConnectionAttempt    ""Connecting to LEWDC001 using pocnetwrix: ACCESS DENIED""            -1    13152    10824

+++++

Then the ""Unable to cast object"" error occurs:

20/03/2025 16:00:02    ERROR    ADP    TManagedDCExtractItf.PrepareForTask    ""Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Byte[]'""    LEWDC001    DCExtract    5812    13152    10824

2) I see the same warning in the attached ""AD_USerRights_log.tsv"" and then the same error 5 lines later as well.

Hi Scotty 

 

 


	Additionally, the AD Permissions Analyzer Job is dependent on a successful AD Inventory scan. Is the customer experiencing any issues with that scan? I would also verify the configuration of this job by checking the assigned host list which should be set to ""One Domain Controller Per Domain"" as well as if the credential that's being used is a local admin or domain admin if the target host is a DC. I have provided documentation to verify these below:



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		MR: Scotty : I have been working with NEA / SB for many years let’s say 7 years now, I think I know the basics
	
	



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			As part of the upload of the artefact file uploaded or emailed is a file called “00438927 - NEA Published Reports - Internal Server Error 20-03-25.zip”
			Within this file ZIPPED file is another file called “1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv” 
		
		
	
	



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	 



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	 



	
	
		 
	
	



	
	
		
		
			 
		
		
	
	



	
	
		
		
			
			
				The 1-AD_Scan_Log.tsv file confirms the AD Scan inventory scan is running perfectly fine 
				I also confirmed within the Word Document “To help” That the File System Module is working perfectly fine along with the AD Module and Also the SharePoint jobs.

I did not get a root cause yet, maybe I can get an answer from development.
Was the hotfix implemented? and Did it work or is this question pre-emptive?

 

Going forward this shouldn't be an issue as the hotfix will be baked into the CU. Not sure about 11.5, but I doubt we would POC too many of those anymore.

Never mind. Looks like we have a hotfix.

If you are free this evening we could maybe implement. Otherwise I can squeeze in some time early. tomorrow.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.076.zip

 

steps to implement.

1. Stop all Running jobs.
2. Close console.
3. Download Zip file from link above.
4. Unblock the zip file. Right click go to Properties and confirm at the bottom if it claims the file is blocked. If its not carry on. If it is Check Unblock and hit apply.


5. Extract Zip files and Enter the Hotfix folder.
6. Copy DC and Private Assemblies folders  and paste into the StealthAudit Install directory. Shortcut is in Windows File Explorer type in %sainstalldir%.
7. Hit ok if it asks about overwriting files.

After that is done Should be able to reopen the console and attempt to run the Permissions Analyzer collection jobs.

Let me know how it goes.

Hey Mark,

I did not get a root cause yet, maybe I can get an answer from development.
Was the hotfix implemented? and Did it work or is this question pre-emptive?

steps to implement.

1. Stop all Running jobs.
2. Close console.
3. Download Zip file from link above.
4. Unblock the zip file. Right click go to Properties and confirm at the bottom if it claims the file is blocked. If its not carry on. If it is Check Unblock and hit apply.


5. Extract Zip files and Enter the Hotfix folder.
6. Copy DC and Private Assemblies folders  and paste into the StealthAudit Install directory. Shortcut is in Windows File Explorer type in %sainstalldir%.
7. Hit ok if it asks about overwriting files.

Hey All,

Development believes the cause was extremely rare due to "" They had some fields in AD that  seemed to be returning as the incorrect type.""

They would like the log from a successful run if you can provide that and want to hop on a call to discuss. 

Here is the link to schedule that.

Never mind. Looks like we have a hotfix.

If you are free this evening we could maybe implement. Otherwise I can squeeze in some time early. tomorrow.

https://releases.netwrix.com/products/auditor-enterprise/11.6/auditor-enterprise-hotfix-11.6.0.076.zip

 

steps to implement.

1. Stop all Running jobs.
2. Close console.
3. Download Zip file from link above.
4. Unblock the zip file. Right click go to Properties and confirm at the bottom if it claims the file is blocked. If its not carry on. If it is Check Unblock and hit apply.


5. Extract Zip files and Enter the Hotfix folder.
6. Copy DC and Private Assemblies folders  and paste into the StealthAudit Install directory. Shortcut is in Windows File Explorer type in %sainstalldir%.
7. Hit ok if it asks about overwriting files.

After that is done Should be able to reopen the console and attempt to run the Permissions Analyzer collection jobs.

Let me know how it goes.



Thanks,

Sorry for the confusion, I have sent link in 2 of my last 3 emails.

If you can upload successful scans for debug before that would be great.

Hey All,

Development believes the cause was extremely rare due to "" They had some fields in AD that  seemed to be returning as the incorrect type.""

They would like the log from a successful run if you can provide that and want to hop on a call to discuss.

Here is the link to schedule that.

Hey Mark,

I did not get a root cause yet, maybe I can get an answer from development.
Was the hotfix implemented? and Did it work or is this question pre-emptive?



Going forward this shouldn't be an issue as the hotfix will be baked into the CU. Not sure about 11.5, but I doubt we would POC too many of those anymore.


Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Mark,

I did not get a root cause yet, maybe I can get an answer from development.
Was the hotfix implemented? and Did it work or is this question pre-emptive?

 

Going forward this shouldn't be an issue as the hotfix will be baked into the CU. Not sure about 11.5, but I doubt we would POC too many of those anymore.


Thanks,

Nicholas Zimmer

Hey Mark,

I did not get a root cause yet, maybe I can get an answer from development.
Was the hotfix implemented? and Did it work or is this question pre-emptive?

 

Going forward this shouldn't be an issue as the hotfix will be baked into the CU. Not sure about 11.5, but I doubt we would POC too many of those anymore.

Hey Mark,

I did not get a root cause yet, maybe I can get an answer from development.
Was the hotfix implemented? and Did it work or is this question pre-emptive?



Going forward this shouldn't be an issue as the hotfix will be baked into the CU. Not sure about 11.5, but I doubt we would POC too many of those anymore.


Thanks,

Otherwise We offer some availability the rest of the week and I'll see if I can make it work.

Sorry for the confusion, I have sent link in 2 of my last 3 emails.

Long story short, please set up a meeting, Development will be there to assist in getting a cause. 

If you can upload successful scans for debug before that would be great.

Thanks,

Hey All,

Development believes the cause was extremely rare due to "" They had some fields in AD that  seemed to be returning as the incorrect type.""

They would like the log from a successful run if you can provide that and want to hop on a call to discuss. 

Here is the link to schedule that.
