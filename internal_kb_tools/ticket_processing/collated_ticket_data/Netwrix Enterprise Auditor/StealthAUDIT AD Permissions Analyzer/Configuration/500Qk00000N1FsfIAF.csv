1) As a test, can we use a Domain Admin cred on the ADPA Collection jobs --does this throw the same error?

2) I would like to see evidence/screenshots that the POCNetwrix account has at least the following permissions on the root of the domain/all AD objects
Read
Read permissions
LDAP Read

3) Also might not hurt to try and run the attached PS script as POCNetwrix from the NEA console server --does this succeed?

4) Another option is try pulling a new copy of the group from instant solutions

4-18 fix implemented waiting on cause from development if we can get it before close.","Symptom
