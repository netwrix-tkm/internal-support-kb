This job is also running for 20+ hours without finishing, forcing us to kill it two days in a row.","","Customer found process in SQL database that was blocking NEA tasks from running.
After clearing these stuck jobs out, NEA is working again.","","Issue:
SQL drop table jobs are stuck and running for over 20+ hours with no movement.
