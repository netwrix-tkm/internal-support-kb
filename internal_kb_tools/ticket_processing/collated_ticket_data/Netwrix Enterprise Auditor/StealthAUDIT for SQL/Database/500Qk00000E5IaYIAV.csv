You can query real time as part of your query to verify you’re not hitting an offline database.

SELECT name FROM sys.databases WHERE state = 0;

Here’s a list of the state descriptions:

0 = ONLINE
1 = RESTORING
2 = RECOVERING 1
3 = RECOVERY_PENDING 1
4 = SUSPECT
5 = EMERGENCY 1
6 = OFFLINE 1
7 = COPYING 2
10 = OFFLINE_SECONDARY 2
