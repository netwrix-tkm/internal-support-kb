fast Y0185-APP0443-S
slow A0185-APP2750-S

seems like some environmental difference then ? @Salesforce can we work out what the difference in the system configuration is ? do they have the same hardware specs? are they in the same physical location ? maybe there is significant network delay between the DB and A0185-APP2750-S? anything more about their set up please. @WaitingOnEngineer

@Salesforce are all scans slower on A0185-APP2750-S? can we run a small job on both machines to see if the difference is present with a reduced data set ?

@Michael Burrofato @James Anderson we can spin up a spike to investigate the logs we do have in more detail as I've only done the minimum for triage so far. I think we are beyond triage now.

I've advised that this could be tracked in SQL profiler, and they've commented that they see query sleeping for long time, I am not sure if it's relevant to the issue. (output is uploaded to Sharepoint)

And yes, I agree it does look like an environmental issue to me as well, I will clarify questions you've listed and will get back to you.","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2025-03-19T10:19:28.000Z","2025-03-19T10:19:28.000Z","false","false"

@Salesforce i will bring this up in the team meeting today and talk about next steps. i'll update this ticket  before the end of the day with feedback. thanks for the work Damir.
Speculation, I'm not sure the sleeping query is the issue unless its sleeping repeatedly between inserts as the biggest slow down is the inserts section as seen in the logs.

Y0185-APP0443-S is dev (non-prod) and A0185-APP2750-S is prod. A0185-DBS0079-S is prod. All servers are in the .AD.Allstate domain.

Servers are in same physical location - screenshot uploaded.

I've collected system information - ms32info from both servers, they look identical to me, even disk size, page file size, ram, it's uploaded to Sharepoint if you want to check.

I am waiting for screenshot from customer side with ping tests for both app servers to target server to provide you latency stats. I will update the ticket once uploaded.","0054u000007p4sbAAA","2025-03-20T07:31:27.000Z","2025-03-20T07:31:27.000Z","false","false"
