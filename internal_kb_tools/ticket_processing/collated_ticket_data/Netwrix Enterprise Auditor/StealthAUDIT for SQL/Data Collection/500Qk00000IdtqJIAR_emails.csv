Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Created the dynamic SQL list.
We also configured your scans for the AD job to use a single domain controller to find lockout events.

We briefly spoke about setting up the AIC to do resource owners and reviews.
Below is a link to the documentation about the resource audits. On left side bar you will also see links to the resource owners and access requests as well.
