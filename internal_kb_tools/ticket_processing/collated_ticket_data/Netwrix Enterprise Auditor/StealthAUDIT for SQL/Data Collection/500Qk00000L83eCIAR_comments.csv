@Salesforce From what I can tell, it looks like maybe the job is configured to run on multiple hosts at once. Can you confirm the list of hosts that this is running on? I don't think the SQL DC is meant to be run on multiple SQL hosts at once.

@Salesforce Upon further review, this appears to be an issue with the SQL DC and running multiple hosts at once

@Salesforce Working on a fix for this, but as a workaround can you check that the 0.Collection -> .Databases Schema -> Update_Schema job didn't get its host list overwritten with the full host list? That one is only intended to run for LOCALHOST.
