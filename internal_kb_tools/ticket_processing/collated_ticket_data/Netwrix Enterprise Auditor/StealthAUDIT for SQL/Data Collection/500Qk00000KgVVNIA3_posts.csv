We have started by checking the stats on the job running for over 30 days. Then we proceeded to confirm that this job, in fact, is still processing SQL servers of undetermined total size (you have around 640 of those). I've explained that scans on such scale can take staggering amount of time due to the amount of the data that needs to be processed and recommended to discuss with Alison if this is absolutely necessary to do. If it is, I suggest doing this scan in smaller chunks and using filtering, for example, not scanning StealthAUDIT database.","","","","0054u000007ow49AAA","2025-01-17T14:39:47.000Z"
