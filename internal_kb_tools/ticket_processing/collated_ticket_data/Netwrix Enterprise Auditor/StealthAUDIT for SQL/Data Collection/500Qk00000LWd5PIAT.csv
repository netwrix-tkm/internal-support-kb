	There was a problem reading file 'L:SQL Audit TraceSQL%5Audit_A32B51F7-297C-4ECD-AF55-D8E507DFAF0D*.sqlaudit' and it will be skipped: Execution Timeout Expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding.","","","","We were able to verify and adjust timeout settings.
this allowed proper log grabbing and successful scans.","Guidance","Nicholas Zimmer","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for SQL","Data Collection","11.6","","56.9","Closed - Resolved","Oak Hill Advisors","Douglas Kupcha","2025-02-06T00:00:40.000Z","2025-04-03T21:47:03.000Z"
