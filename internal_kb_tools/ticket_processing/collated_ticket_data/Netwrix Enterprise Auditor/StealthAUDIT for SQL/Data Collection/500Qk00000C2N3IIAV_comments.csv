"00aQk000007QsyPIAS","500Qk00000C2N3IIAV","Probably need to confirm a few things. Best to get on a call.
First Place is in the Settings > Application Node.
There is a Host Target Options Setting - make sure its set to ""use Host name"" not ""prefer DNS name if available""
This setting can cause host lists to switch to FQDN when jobs are run.

Then I would of course confirm the correct host lists with the names as we expect are in place.

I would also doublecheck on these SQL servers in the Query > Filter > Connections Screen Make sure they successfully connect there as expected.","0054u000006gpoAAAQ","2024-06-19T17:04:58.000Z","2024-06-19T17:04:58.000Z","false","false"
