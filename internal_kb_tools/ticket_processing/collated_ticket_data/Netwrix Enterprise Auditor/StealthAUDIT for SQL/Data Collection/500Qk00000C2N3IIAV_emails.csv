Hi Frantz,



As I am working in IST time zone, could not able to select any of the slot which you have shared.

Riya,

What is the result of the same for the 'mismatched' FQDN?

I can see an error message related to non-existent domain. Is this server in-domain with NEA?

Hi Ilya Kotov,

The below mismatch server is in Wipro domain only.

Would be great if we can connect and sort out this, since we are not able to scan any MSSQL scan jobs. Will be available tomorrow morning from 9am-7pm IST. Kindly share the meeting invite to sort out this at the earliest.

Hi Ilya Kotov,

 

The below mismatch server is in Wipro domain only.

 

Would be great if we can connect and sort out this, since we are not able to scan any MSSQL scan jobs. Will be available tomorrow morning from 9am-7pm IST. Kindly share the meeting invite to sort out this at the earliest.

Hi,

I remind you that we need to have an investigation first to resolve this issue as soon as possible.
 



What is the result of the same for the 'mismatched' FQDN?



 


I can see an error message related to non-existent domain. Is this server in-domain with NEA?
