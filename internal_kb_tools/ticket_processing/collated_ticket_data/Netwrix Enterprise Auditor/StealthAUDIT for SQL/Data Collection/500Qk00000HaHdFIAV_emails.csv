Hi Scottie et al,
What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
[cid:image001.png@01DB2F13.AC2E9660]

Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10.

Thank you,
Alison.

Hi Scottie et al,

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:


Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10. 

 

Thank you,

Alison.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HaHdF:ref
Hi Scottie et al,
What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
[cid:image001.png@01DB35F0.19988250]

Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10.

Thank you,
Alison.

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.
 
These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:


	
	Active Directory Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	AWS Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Box Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Databases Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Entra ID Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Exchange Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	File System Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	SharePoint Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Unix Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Windows Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	

Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:


Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10. 

 

Thank you,

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.
 
These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:


	
	Active Directory Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	AWS Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Box Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Databases Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Entra ID Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Exchange Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	File System Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	SharePoint Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Unix Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	
	
	Windows Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	

Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

Discussed with the DBA team and they informed that due to large queries and temp db usage, drive is utilized and causing issue. Please advise.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.


These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:

Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HaHdF:ref
Hi Scottie et al,
What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
[cid:image001.png@01DB3788.5632C790]

Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10.

Thank you,
Alison.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.
 

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:


	Active Directory Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	AWS Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Box Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Databases Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Entra ID Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Exchange Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	File System Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	SharePoint Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Unix Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Windows Solution Requirements on the SQL Server


Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

Hi Scottie et al,

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:


Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10. 

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.
 

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:


	Active Directory Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	AWS Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Box Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Databases Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Entra ID Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Exchange Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	File System Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	SharePoint Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Unix Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Windows Solution Requirements on the SQL Server


Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

Hi Team,

 

Discussed with the DBA team and they informed that due to large queries and temp db usage, drive is utilized and causing issue. Please advise.

Hi Scottie et al,

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:


Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10. 

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HaHdF:ref
Hi Scottie et al,
What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
[cid:image001.png@01DB3B51.13140330]

Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10.

Thank you,
Alison.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.
 

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:


	Active Directory Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	AWS Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Box Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Databases Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Entra ID Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Exchange Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	File System Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	SharePoint Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Unix Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Windows Solution Requirements on the SQL Server


Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

Hi Team,

 

Discussed with the DBA team and they informed that due to large queries and temp db usage, drive is utilized and causing issue. Please advise.

Hi Scottie et al,

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:


Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10. 

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Ilya,

Our Environment on both SQL server and windows server are above vendor recommendation . On our Database server the specs are:

G Drive equates to temp DB, temp DB has now been increased to 1.5TB
E Drive equates to File space is now at 2.2TB
We are above the vendor recommendation, and we have requested assistance to determine what queries are consuming the space.
And please find the update from DBA team:
Tempdb lives on the G: drive. You have plenty of free space on this server for growth.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.


These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:

Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HaHdF:ref
Hi Scottie et al,
What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
[cid:image002.png@01DB3B88.9BB17150]

Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10.

Thank you,
Alison.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HaHdF:ref



Hi Ilya,

 

Our Environment on both SQL server and windows server are above vendor recommendation . On our Database server the specs are:

 

G Drive equates to temp DB, temp DB has now been increased to 1.5TB

E Drive equates to File space is now at 2.2TB

We are above the vendor recommendation, and we have requested assistance to determine what queries are consuming the space.

And please find the update from DBA team:

Tempdb lives on the G: drive. You have plenty of free space on this server for growth.

 



 

Let me know if this isn’t what you need.

 

 

Thanks,

Kaviya.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.
 

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:


	Active Directory Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	AWS Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Box Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Databases Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Entra ID Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Exchange Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	File System Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	SharePoint Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Unix Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Windows Solution Requirements on the SQL Server


Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

Hi Scottie et al,

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:


Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10. 

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi Ilya,

Our Environment on both SQL server and windows server are above vendor recommendation . On our Database server the specs are:

G Drive equates to temp DB, temp DB has now been increased to 1.5TB
E Drive equates to File space is now at 2.2TB
We are above the vendor recommendation, and we have requested assistance to determine what queries are consuming the space.
And please find the update from DBA team:
Tempdb lives on the G: drive. You have plenty of free space on this server for growth.

[cid:image002.png@01DB3C2E.6EF20AC0]

Let me know if this isn’t what you need.


Thanks,
Kaviya.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.


These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:

Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HaHdF:ref
Hi Scottie et al,
What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
[cid:image003.png@01DB3C2E.6EF20AC0]

Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10.

Thank you,
Alison.

I suggest increasing your SQL server's CPU count for faster operations. Your Ram seems to be at 128GB yet, you only run 3 physical cores. Please try to increase the CPU count to at least 8.

Hi Ilya,

 

Our Environment on both SQL server and windows server are above vendor recommendation . On our Database server the specs are:

 

G Drive equates to temp DB, temp DB has now been increased to 1.5TB

E Drive equates to File space is now at 2.2TB

We are above the vendor recommendation, and we have requested assistance to determine what queries are consuming the space.

And please find the update from DBA team:

Tempdb lives on the G: drive. You have plenty of free space on this server for growth.

 



 

Let me know if this isn’t what you need.

 

 

Thanks,

Kaviya.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.
 

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:


	Active Directory Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	AWS Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Box Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Databases Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Entra ID Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Exchange Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	File System Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	SharePoint Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Unix Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Windows Solution Requirements on the SQL Server


Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

Hi Scottie et al,

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:


Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10. 

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Kaviya,

I suggest increasing your SQL server's CPU count for faster operations. Your Ram seems to be at 128GB yet, you only run 3 physical cores. Please try to increase the CPU count to at least 8.

Hi Ilya,

 

Our Environment on both SQL server and windows server are above vendor recommendation . On our Database server the specs are:

 

G Drive equates to temp DB, temp DB has now been increased to 1.5TB

E Drive equates to File space is now at 2.2TB

We are above the vendor recommendation, and we have requested assistance to determine what queries are consuming the space.

And please find the update from DBA team:

Tempdb lives on the G: drive. You have plenty of free space on this server for growth.

 



 

Let me know if this isn’t what you need.

 

 

Thanks,

Kaviya.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.
 

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:


	Active Directory Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	AWS Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Box Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Databases Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Entra ID Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Exchange Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	File System Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	SharePoint Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Unix Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Windows Solution Requirements on the SQL Server


Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

Hi Scottie et al,

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:


Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10. 

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Kaviya,

I suggest increasing your SQL server's CPU count for faster operations. Your Ram seems to be at 128GB yet, you only run 3 physical cores. Please try to increase the CPU count to at least 8.

Hi Ilya,

Our Environment on both SQL server and windows server are above vendor recommendation . On our Database server the specs are:

G Drive equates to temp DB, temp DB has now been increased to 1.5TB
E Drive equates to File space is now at 2.2TB
We are above the vendor recommendation, and we have requested assistance to determine what queries are consuming the space.
And please find the update from DBA team:
Tempdb lives on the G: drive. You have plenty of free space on this server for growth.

[cid:image002.png@01DB3F7B.22832930]

Let me know if this isn’t what you need.


Thanks,
Kaviya.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.

Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HaHdF:ref
Hi Scottie et al,
What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
[cid:image003.png@01DB3F7B.22832930]

Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10.

Thank you,
Alison.

Kaviya,

I suggest increasing your SQL server's CPU count for faster operations. Your Ram seems to be at 128GB yet, you only run 3 physical cores. Please try to increase the CPU count to at least 8.

Hi Ilya,

 

Our Environment on both SQL server and windows server are above vendor recommendation . On our Database server the specs are:

 

G Drive equates to temp DB, temp DB has now been increased to 1.5TB

E Drive equates to File space is now at 2.2TB

We are above the vendor recommendation, and we have requested assistance to determine what queries are consuming the space.

And please find the update from DBA team:

Tempdb lives on the G: drive. You have plenty of free space on this server for growth.

 



 

Let me know if this isn’t what you need.

 

 

Thanks,

Kaviya.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.
 

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:


	Active Directory Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	AWS Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Box Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Databases Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Entra ID Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Exchange Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	File System Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	SharePoint Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Unix Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Windows Solution Requirements on the SQL Server


Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HaHdF:ref


Hi Scottie et al,

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:


Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10. 

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Kaviya,

I suggest increasing your SQL server's CPU count for faster operations. Your Ram seems to be at 128GB yet, you only run 3 physical cores. Please try to increase the CPU count to at least 8.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Hi Ilya,

Our Environment on both SQL server and windows server are above vendor recommendation . On our Database server the specs are:

G Drive equates to temp DB, temp DB has now been increased to 1.5TB
E Drive equates to File space is now at 2.2TB
We are above the vendor recommendation, and we have requested assistance to determine what queries are consuming the space.
And please find the update from DBA team:
Tempdb lives on the G: drive. You have plenty of free space on this server for growth.

[cid:image002.png@01DB4109.BFA45290]

Let me know if this isn’t what you need.


Thanks,
Kaviya.

Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HaHdF:ref
Hi Scottie et al,
What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
[cid:image003.png@01DB4109.BFA45290]

Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10.

Thank you,
Alison.

Kaviya,

I suggest increasing your SQL server's CPU count for faster operations. Your Ram seems to be at 128GB yet, you only run 3 physical cores. Please try to increase the CPU count to at least 8.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HaHdF:ref

 


Hi Ilya,

 

Our Environment on both SQL server and windows server are above vendor recommendation . On our Database server the specs are:

 

G Drive equates to temp DB, temp DB has now been increased to 1.5TB

E Drive equates to File space is now at 2.2TB

We are above the vendor recommendation, and we have requested assistance to determine what queries are consuming the space.

And please find the update from DBA team:

Tempdb lives on the G: drive. You have plenty of free space on this server for growth.

 



 

Let me know if this isn’t what you need.

 

 

Thanks,

Kaviya.

Kaviya,

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.
 

These are dependent upon the size of the target environment. See the following topics for additional:


	Active Directory Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Active Directory Permissions Analyzer Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	AWS Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Box Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Databases Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Entra ID Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Exchange Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	File System Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	SharePoint Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Unix Solution Requirements on the SQL Server
	Windows Solution Requirements on the SQL Server


Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

Discussed with the DBA team and they informed that due to large queries and temp db usage, drive is utilized and causing issue. Please advise.

Hi Scottie et al,

What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:


Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10. 

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Kaviya,

I suggest increasing your SQL server's CPU count for faster operations. Your Ram seems to be at 128GB yet, you only run 3 physical cores. Please try to increase the CPU count to at least 8.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Hi Ilya,

Our Environment on both SQL server and windows server are above vendor recommendation . On our Database server the specs are:

G Drive equates to temp DB, temp DB has now been increased to 1.5TB
E Drive equates to File space is now at 2.2TB
We are above the vendor recommendation, and we have requested assistance to determine what queries are consuming the space.
And please find the update from DBA team:
Tempdb lives on the G: drive. You have plenty of free space on this server for growth.

[cid:image002.png@01DB44D0.6066AE70]

Let me know if this isn’t what you need.


Thanks,
Kaviya.

Knowing your environment's scale I assume that the root cause is tied to insufficient CPU/RAM. I will provide you links to ALL collectors SQL requirements that should be handed to your DBA Team to provide the necessary computing power.

Please refer to the ones you actively use. The requirements are bottom-line, meaning that if one of your collectors (SharePoint or File Server, for example) requires 16 CPU 16 RAM and the other requires 8 CPU 32 RAM, your total should be 16 CPU and 32 RAM (mock numbers, just to explain the logic)

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HaHdF:ref
Hi Scottie et al,
What is the impact of the issue on your business? Unable to scan SQL platform.
Who is affected by this issue? The SQL platform auditors.
What steps have already been taken to troubleshoot the issue? Reviewed job logs and ensured the scan is configured to scan SQL on prem as opposed to SQL online.
What are you trying to do or accomplish? Scan the SQL on prem platform for all user access and object permissions.
Is this a new configuration, data collection, or report? No
If no, has anything changed in your environment since the last time it worked? Upgrade to v.11.6.
When did this issue start?  This week.
What are the steps to reproduce? Run the SQL scan from the job list.
What software is currently installed - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
[cid:image003.png@01DB44D0.6066AE70]

Artifacts attached above from SMP (no AIC logs).
Also attached is job messages log. The job folder itself has been uploaded to the Netwrix ticket portal.
Threads are already set to 10.

Thank you,
Alison.
