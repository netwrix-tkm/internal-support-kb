**Problem Statement/Business Impact**
Customer has the Databases0.CollectionSQL4-SQL_ServerLogons scheduled to run every 1-2 minutes to scrape the SQL logs for logon activity. They also have the Databases group scheduled to run every night. When the 2-SQL_PermissionsScan is running, the 4-SQL_ServerLogons job does not behave correctly. It will either not start, or be very slow/laggy, but only while the 2-SQL_PermissionsScan is running.

**Desired Outcome**
Customer would like the 4-SQL_ServerLogons to run on a fairly consistent schedule even while the 2-SQL_PermissionsScan is running.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Schedule the Database job group (or the Database0.CollectionSQL group)
2. Schedule the 4-SQL_ServerLogons job to run every minute
3. Kick off the database group from the schedule

**Troubleshooting Completed/Notes**
- 4-SQL_ServerLogons runs for about 3-4 minutes
- 2-SQL_PermissionsScan

**Logs Uploaded**
- 4-SQL_ServerLogons JobStats1 & 2
- Schedule for 4-SQL_ServerLogons & the Database group","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2024-07-05T16:01:49.000Z","2024-07-05T16:11:26.000Z","false","false"

**Current Issue**
The SQL_ServerLogons job lags when the SQL_Permissions job is running, causing the customer to lose logon activity (lots of SQL servers with logs that roll over VERY quickly).

**Troubleshooting Completed during Meeting**
Verified customer is using a customer sql script to gather data:
Select loginame, db_name(dbid) as dbname,hostname,  max(last_batch) login_time_max from sys.sysprocesses with (nolock) where loginame<>'sa' and  loginame<>'' group by loginame, hostname,db_name(dbid)

**Logs/Screenshots Collected**
--SQL_ServerLogons_NormalRun
--SQL_ServerLogon_ConflictedRun

**Next Steps**
Discuss with the behavior with the product owner (James Anderson)","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2024-07-18T19:35:10.000Z","2024-07-18T19:55:59.000Z","false","false"

@Salesforce - i see the associated support ticket was Closed-By Client. Is the customer still experiencing this issue or are we good to close the escalation?

@Ethan Israel I think it will be because I switched them out to use the same server logins job I created for Oak Hill to collect login data from RDS. This job does not suffer from the issue described here. I still need to confirm that it fulfils all of their needs. I was planning to close this one when I had that. @Salesforce
