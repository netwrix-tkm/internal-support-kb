I have 2 host. The 1st host is the main file system. The 2nd host is offline and only used for testing purposes.
The effective access is not showing for host 1. The Stealthbits is a directory on host 1.
Yes the host 1 is apart of an FSAA scan and does have an active query. I have daily and weekly jobs that are running fine. IM happy to hope on a call tomorrow for you to view what im talking about.
The below query is generating results now.

Meeting is needed to check why dbo.SA_FSAA_EffectiveAccessView is not updating properly. As well as FSAA scan health.
The FSAA-System Scans and Bulk Import jobs are only required to update that view.","0054u000007MeUDAA0","2024-07-22T14:01:17.000Z","2024-07-22T14:04:14.000Z","false","false"

Effective access view results should be expanded so we can observed the effective permissions on this folder.
It appears this is populated, but not showing in AIC. Screenshots or evidence of what they observe in AIC. (did it work before for this host, do they have it working for any other host/share)","0054u000006goPuAAI","2024-07-23T13:29:56.000Z","2024-07-23T13:29:56.000Z","false","false"
