We have an issue at PERN in Access Information Center console, which is commonly used in this environment.
There is a new error that appears only sometimes (like 2 times in week) when AIC admin would like to add or change an owner to the resource. 
Error says that ""There are no domains available to search"" when we are on adding new user from AD page. Of course it also prevent searching and choosing any user from AD.
Restart of the AIC service fixes this issue but this is not a resolution for us.
Sending logs and screenshots.

Regards,
Adam Rudnicki","Add or change the owner of the resource, encounter an error message that goes away after restart of AIC service","The issue is there for 2-3 weeks, currently alleviated by restarting AIC service, which is not a permanent solution.

The issue is irreproducible and highly unpredictable on when it happens","Checking the logs, posting in SWAT
Waiting for SWAT to propose a solution to test","We monitored the console for the reoccurence, but it never happened. You have agreed to close the case.","Root Cause Unknown","Ilya Kotov","Error","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","Access Information Center","Resource Owner","11.6","11.6.0.21","27.2","Closed - Resolved","PERN S.A.","Support Appeal","2025-01-14T11:05:27.000Z","2025-02-10T14:54:12.000Z"
