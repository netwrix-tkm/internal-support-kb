We have an issue at PERN in Access Information Center console, which is commonly used in this environment.
There is a new error that appears only sometimes (like 2 times in week) when AIC admin would like to add or change an owner to the resource. 
Error says that ""There are no domains available to search"" when we are on adding new user from AD page. Of course it also prevent searching and choosing any user from AD.
Restart of the AIC service fixes this issue but this is not a resolution for us.
Sending logs and screenshots.

Regards,
Adam Rudnicki","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-14T11:05:27.000Z"
