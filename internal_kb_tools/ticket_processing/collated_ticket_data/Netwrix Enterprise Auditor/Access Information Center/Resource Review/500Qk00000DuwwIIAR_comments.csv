@Salesforce @Michael Burrofato @Ethan Israel @Sanjay Meghani Sorry if I was unclear, using the ScanContinuityId and USN from the t1s, can we check the integrity of the t2s by looking at the values from TaskStatus?  I'm used to using DB Browser for SQLite to look at the tables, but you can also run this query

--- CODE ---
Select
*
FROM
TaskStatus
WHERE
ScanContinuityId = '048DBF6E-8023-491D-B7E3-E17AFCF22F81' OR
USN = 37

I can see the query returns the null for the trustee deleted column instead of 0 or 1 which causes the issue. I created a bug item to fix this issue.

Sorry for the confusion on the T2 files. It seems Brendan posted a comment on the wrong ticket accidentally. We don't need T2 files for this AIC issue.

The 12.0 fix has been delivered to QA for testing and once QA finishes testing it, the fix will be applied to 11.6.
