They are resources that will be in the access review. I have a fairly short time-frame, I need to resolve this by 6/9 to stay on track to launch the review on 6/11.

Below are the share paths that are not currently recognized by our installation of StealchAUDIT AIC:

05/27/2025
--------
The missing shares that the customer was looking for are DFS shares. I discovered that all DFS jobs had been disabled and were not running since October 2024.
I enabled the jobs and ran job 1 to enumerate the shares. The missing shares were found and I started the full job group.


The customer in this case is indicating that there are file shares missing from his AIC. I suspect this is a scan/bulk import issue or possibly scoping that may be excluding the shares.","","","","005Qk000002AJWTIA4","2025-05-27T18:32:19.000Z"
