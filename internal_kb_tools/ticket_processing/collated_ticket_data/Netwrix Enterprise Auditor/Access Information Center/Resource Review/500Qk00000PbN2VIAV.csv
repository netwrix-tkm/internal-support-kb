They are resources that will be in the access review. I have a fairly short time-frame, I need to resolve this by 6/9 to stay on track to launch the review on 6/11.

Below are the share paths that are not currently recognized by our installation of StealchAUDIT AIC:

Some shares that are expected are not showing","--------

--------
The missing shares that the customer was looking for are DFS shares. I discovered that all DFS jobs had been disabled and were not running since October 2024.
I enabled the jobs and ran job 1 to enumerate the shares. The missing shares were found and I started the full job group.


The customer in this case is indicating that there are file shares missing from his AIC. I suspect this is a scan/bulk import issue or possibly scoping that may be excluding the shares.","Awaiting job group to finish running and will follow up to ensure missing share are properly showing in the AIC.","Issue:
AIC is not displaying shares that are needed for audit.

Cause:
DFS scans were disabled in NAA, leading to the shares not existing in the database.

Resolution:
Enabled the DFS shares and started the FSAA scan and bulk import jobs.
We then validated that the shares are populated correctly in the AIC.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Ian Ranstrom","Unexpected Behavior","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","Access Information Center","Resource Review","11.6","","3.9","Closed - Resolved","USAA","Rich Harbaugh","2025-05-26T17:52:06.000Z","2025-05-30T15:22:43.000Z"
