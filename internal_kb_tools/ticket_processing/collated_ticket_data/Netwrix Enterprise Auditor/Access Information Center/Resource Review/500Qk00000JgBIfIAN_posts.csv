Hello,
We are testing the netwrix resource audit section of netwrix auditor.  We identified the groups for read and modify however the file share is pulling in our domain admin group for review.  Is there a way we can exclude a group like ""domain admins"" from a resource audit?  We don't want data owners to see the service accounts in the review.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-18T22:34:00.000Z"
