"500Qk00000FFxS9IAL","00419830","Support Ticket","AIC Multiple Group permissions","Hello,

I have added multiple groups to the AIC for console access and restricted the access to specific servers. One of my users, who is in more than one group, only sees the servers from the first group, but not from every group. Is there maybe some restrictions in this regard?
