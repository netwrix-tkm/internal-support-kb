Thank you for contacting Netwrix Support. I am Saqib and I am happy to assist you with this case.

As discussed during our today's call on another ticket, you mentioned that the SSL certificate got expired for Access Information Center. Observing the error, it appears that ports are configured incorrectly. Since there are two portals associated with Netwrix Access Analyzer (StealthAUDIT), I am sharing KBs to verify and update settings for both so that the conflict between portals is removed:

For Reporting Module: Securing the Web Console

For Access Information Center: Securing the Access Information Center

Have a great day!
