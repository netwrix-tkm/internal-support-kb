@Salesforce @Helen Randall - it looks like we have a fix for this issue in 11.6+. This is marked for discussion on our next refinement call to determine the level of effort and ETA for merging that fix down to 11.5.

@Salesforce @Helen Randall - this has been refined with dev, there is a fix for this issue already implemented in 11.6, we just need to merge it down to 11.5 and test. The ticket for that merge is near the top of the backlog and I expect to pull it onto the dev sprint starting 1/22.
