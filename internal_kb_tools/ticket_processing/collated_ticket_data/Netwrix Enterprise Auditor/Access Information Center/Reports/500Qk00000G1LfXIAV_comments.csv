I showed the customer that events were coming in and found an object that had events. We were then able to navigate to this object and see events to show the customer how it would display if there were events available to display. Customer requested case stay open until the following Monday (9/30/2024) and then I will close.","005Qk000002AJWTIA4","2024-09-27T21:07:57.000Z","2024-09-27T21:07:57.000Z","false","false"
