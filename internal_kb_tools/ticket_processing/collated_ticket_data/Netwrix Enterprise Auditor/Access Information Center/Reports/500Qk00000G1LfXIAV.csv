The management would want this fixed soon. See screenshot from NEA GUI.","","","","Issue:
Checking the report for an object under attributeChange shows no information.

Cause:
The object and time frame we were looking at does not have any events to display, leading to a blank display.

Resolution:
No change was needed, we verified that changes were coming in and that these changes were showing in the appropriate objects.","Guidance","Ian Ranstrom","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","Access Information Center","Reports","11.6","","10.5","Closed - Resolved","Credit One Bank","Vijay Chandar","2024-09-20T02:21:53.000Z","2024-09-30T14:54:40.000Z"
