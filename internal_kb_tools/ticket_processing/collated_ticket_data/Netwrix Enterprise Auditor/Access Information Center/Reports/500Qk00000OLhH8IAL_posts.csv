We have observed that the AIC console is not working as expected. We can see only reports but not the folders and their permissions view on WEB as it throws error as Page can,t be displayed. Request you to please set up a call and provide solution for the same.

Mr Saqib Sharif the Technical Engineer has seen this error, so request you to please assign to him as his work timing is similar to mine.

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen V.Huilgol.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-23T05:56:18.000Z"
