I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved.
The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

What We've Learned Updated: StealthAUDIT 11.5 and greater does not depend upon Silverlight.
Access Information Center 11.5 and greater (which is an addon to StealthAUDIT) also does not depend upon Silverlight.

Microsoft Silverlight is not required for either of these product versions or greater.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!
