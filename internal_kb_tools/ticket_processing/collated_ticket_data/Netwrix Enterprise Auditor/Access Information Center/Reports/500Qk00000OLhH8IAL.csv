We have observed that the AIC console is not working as expected. We can see only reports but not the folders and their permissions view on WEB as it throws error as Page can,t be displayed. Request you to please set up a call and provide solution for the same.

Mr Saqib Sharif the Technical Engineer has seen this error, so request you to please assign to him as his work timing is similar to mine.

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen V.Huilgol.","Step 1: Configure SSL settings in webservice.config and web.config (SA & AIC v11.5 only).
Step 2: Do not attach SSL certificate to binding ports in IIS.","During meeting on ticket 00438781, customer mentioned that the SSL certificate got expired for AIC and they replaced it. Since then, the AIC is inaccessible. I have shared the KB links to both Reporting Module and AIC for HTTPs.
