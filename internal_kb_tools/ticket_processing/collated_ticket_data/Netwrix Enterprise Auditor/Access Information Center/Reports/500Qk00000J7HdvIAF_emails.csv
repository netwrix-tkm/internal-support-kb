I was out for a medical emergency for most of February and March.  I am just back at work and catching up now.  I appreciate your patience as I get back on my feet and back up to speed on these issues.

I'm glad to hear you're back. I'd like to check in on how the AIC is doing - previously we were getting a 500 error when searching users in the AIC and trying to use the reports within. That was cleared up in AIC v11.6.0.36+ so patching to a build post-that should correct your issue. Let me know once you've had time to update, or if you need any assistance doing so.

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri
