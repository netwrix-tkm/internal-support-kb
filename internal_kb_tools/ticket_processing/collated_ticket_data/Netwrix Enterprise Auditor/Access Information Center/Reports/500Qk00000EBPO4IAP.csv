I go the Permissions under Reports and select Include Inherited and I get 100,000 rows. Is there a way to change the scope to something such as the Server Name so that I can see all rows?

The customer is unable to export reports from the AIC

[Resolution]
We allowed browser pop-ups so the download can start
