The step by step guide is explained in Images and imags are now downloading on end users email. As suggested by Netwrix, we tried to use base64 for adding the images as workaround. But still we are not getting results. Request for immdeiate assistance on the same, so that we can start performing Access Review at the earliest.

Thanks

Step 2: Modify the AIC email template to include Base64-encoded images using the `<img>` HTML tag (e.g., `<img src=""data:image/png;base64,REPLACETHIS"" alt=""Embedded Image"">`).  
Step 3: Send a test email from the AIC console to end users.  
Step 4: Check the recipient's email to verify whether the images are displayed correctly or if the ""Embedded Image"" placeholder appears instead.

- A suggested workaround using Base64 encoding for embedding images in the email template was implemented, but it did not resolve the issue.
- The AIC console correctly sends the HTML body of the email template, including Base64-encoded images, but the recipient's email client may not support inline images in Base64 encoding.
- The fallback mechanisms in the HTML template (e.g., ""alt"" text for images and download links for PDFs) are functioning as intended, but recipients still do not see the images embedded in the email.
- It is unclear whether the issue lies with the AIC console's email generation process or the compatibility of the recipient's email client with Base64-encoded images.
- Additional clarification is needed to determine what the customer means by ""not getting results"" and whether the issue is related to the email client displaying fallback text instead of images.

The customer (Praveen) should upload a copy of the email where the issue is observed and provide the debug log from the Access Information Center (AIC) when it sends an email. This will help the support team analyze the issue further.

2. The support team (Artem Naskal) will review the provided email and debug log to identify any discrepancies or errors in the AIC email template or Base64 encoding implementation.

3. If additional input is required for escalation, the support team will consult the SWAT team to determine if further information or logs are needed for development to investigate.
