Hi Saqib,

 

1.       This error only occurs when user permissions. Other options can be displayed normally.

2.       In addition, I use folder query and click permission can display it.

Hi Saqib,

 

1.       This error only occurs when user permissions. Other options can be displayed normally.

2.       In addition, I use folder query and click permission can display it.

 

 

Kind regards

Hi Saqib,

 

Why don’t other sites have this issue with the same version? My lab is also using the same version and doesn’t have this issue either.

Hi Cooper,

The ""Status: 500"" errors are identified as bugs and rectified in newer builds of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (StealthAudit). I am attaching the Bug Fixes Notes for your reference:

You are requested to get StealthAudit upgraded to latest version as the version installed in TSMC is out of support now.
