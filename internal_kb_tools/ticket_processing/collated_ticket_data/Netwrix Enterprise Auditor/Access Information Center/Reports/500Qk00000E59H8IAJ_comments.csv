**Current Issue**
- Customer searches ID, gets url: /v2/admins/data/audit/reports/trustee/applied-permissions status: 500

**Troubleshooting Completed during Meeting**
- Current AIC Version: 11.6.0.12
- Upgrade to AIC v11.6.0.21
--- Rebound to port 481
--- Restarted Netwrix AIC Service
- Based on the logs, the permissions report the customer is trying to load is from SPAA which is not currently being run, hence why the view is missing. Customer is ok with this not working as they have not set it up yet and are not at a place to do so yet.","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2024-08-08T15:18:13.000Z","2024-08-08T15:25:34.000Z","false","false"
