I hope you are doing fine. I haven't had a response on this ticket after attempting to contact you previously. Since the reported issue will be resolved by upgrading to the latest version of Netwrix Enterprise Auditor and Access Information Center, the incident will now be closed. If you require further information, the incident ticket can be reopened within 30 days, after this time a new ticket can be created and linked to this incident ticket for history.

Have a great day!
