"500Qk00000E59H8IAJ","00417269","Support Ticket","Cert issue is AIC","Please help fix the cert issue on the AIC @ John Deere.","","","","[Issue]
The following error is received when searching for a username in the AIC, and then selecting the ""Permissions"" report: url: /v2/admins/data/audit/reports/trustee/applied-permissions status: 500

[Root Cause]
This report relies on the SharePointSPAA System Scan & SharePointSPAA Bulk Import to run as it creates the SPAA_PermissionsView this report relies on.

[Resolution]
We upgraded the Netwrix AIC to v11.6.0.21 (from v11.6.0.12) to rule out any recently fixed bugs. After the upgrade, we took a look at the log and saw it was attempting to call a view that has not been created. At this time, you are fine with that report not running as that group is not setup.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","Access Information Center","Reports","","","2.0","Closed - Resolved","John Deere Company","Scott Prigge","2024-08-06T15:50:44.000Z","2024-08-08T15:33:08.000Z"
