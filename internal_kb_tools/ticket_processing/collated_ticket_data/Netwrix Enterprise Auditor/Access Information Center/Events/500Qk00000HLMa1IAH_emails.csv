Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Performed an upgrade on the AIC to the latest available version (11.6.0.25) by performing the process mentioned in the documentation below:

Upgrade Procedure

Once the upgrade process was successfully completed we were able to view recent file system activity in the AIC on the desired hosts. 

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the File System 0.Collections job group to run through the scheduled tasks and verify that the information is displayed in the AIC if there are any new or updated file system activity or permission changes.

I will:

Continue to keep this ticket in an postponed reply status and I will reach out tomorrow for a status update on the AIC and FSAC system scan jobs. 

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. That is an older version of the 11.6 AIC. I think upgrading the AIC to the latest version will resolve the issue of not being able to view that information in the web console. I recommend performing a snapshot of the application server and verifying the credentials that are used to run the services for the AIC.

If you would like to schedule a meeting you may use the link below:

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you try running the FSAC system scan again on that host? I was able to test in my lab by removing the Stats and Struc FSAC.fsaadb files and running the FSAC system scan again to create those files.

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. That is a different error than we received last time. This seems to have gotten further in the scanning process but can't identify the database files. Before running the Bulk Import was the FSAC System scan run first?  If you navigate to the file path below for the host that's throwing that error are there any StatsFSAC.fsaadb and StrucFSAC.fsaadb files for that host?

Program Files (x86)StealthAuditFSAA

Could you also verify that the StructMap file exists in that location as well?

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Since the database job group is running it will most likely lock the tables up if you try to run a repair with that job running. If you can stop the job, run the repair tool, and the restart both the database and the FSAC system scan that would be best.

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Identified that the FSAC system scans are erroring out on a host ""Unable to start scan"". We have verified that the agent is collecting activity by testing a file creation and deletion. We also verified that the events are successfully being sent to a SIEM as well. 

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the current scheduled jobs to finish. Then run the repair tool on the desired host. This can be accessed at the location below:



Once the repair has been completed please run the FSAC System Scan and Bulk Import on the desired host and provide an update to the results of the scan job.

Thank you,

I am not seeing the file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. I can see it on some of the jobs but not on all of them. I have other issues like the activity monitor that feeds to my Qradar are not giving the data that I know it should be giving.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application, you have FSAA jobs that collect file system permissions and FSAC jobs that collect file system activity. In the ticket description, you mentioned that you were not able to view file data from the current file server. Is that type of data file system activity or permissions? If you're tracking file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. This would utilize the Activity Monitor agents and we would start troubleshooting this issue there. If it's permissions data that you're not seeing then verifying whether you're using proxies would be a great start there. 

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. Is this file activity or is this permissions-based file data?

If it is permissions file system data are you using proxies?

Thank you, 

Scottie Taylor

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to connect with me via Zoom today. Upon connecting to the meeting, it was brought to my attention that the product you're experiencing issues with is Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which is a separate entity from Netwrix Auditor. I will be working to get you connected with a member of the Enterprise Auditor team as soon as possible. I thank you again for taking the time to explain some of the issues you were experiencing on our call today, and I will make best efforts to relay what we covered to the engineer that gets assigned your case. I appreciate your patience in the interim. 

Regards,
Trever McConnell, Technical Support Engineer

1. Are you looking to run a report to identify a specific file and the time/date files from that server were deleted? If so, do you have a general idea of the range of time they were deleted? Yes 

2. Additionally, is this ""current"" file server a new addition to your file server auditing monitoring plan, or has it been in place for awhile? No it has been there for a while

3. Are other actions such as files being added, read, modified, etc being shown for the ""current"" file server when performing a search in Netwrix Auditor? No I get not DATA

4. Has auditing for this ""current"" file server ever worked properly, or is this a new addition to your monitoring plan you're aiming to get configured?  Yes before the upgrade and since I got the issues fixed it seem to work but now I get no data.

Scottie,

I get the activity from the file server now but not from the SQL server or Active Directory. When I search for the Data on a server I still do not get the data there also.

Thanks

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Performed an upgrade on the AIC to the latest available version (11.6.0.25) by performing the process mentioned in the documentation below:

Upgrade Procedure<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm>

Once the upgrade process was successfully completed we were able to view recent file system activity in the AIC on the desired hosts.

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the File System 0.Collections job group to run through the scheduled tasks and verify that the information is displayed in the AIC if there are any new or updated file system activity or permission changes.

I will:

Continue to keep this ticket in an postponed reply status and I will reach out tomorrow for a status update on the AIC and FSAC system scan jobs.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. That is an older version of the 11.6 AIC. I think upgrading the AIC to the latest version will resolve the issue of not being able to view that information in the web console. I recommend performing a snapshot of the application server and verifying the credentials that are used to run the services for the AIC.

If you would like to schedule a meeting you may use the link below:

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you try running the FSAC system scan again on that host? I was able to test in my lab by removing the Stats and Struc FSAC.fsaadb files and running the FSAC system scan again to create those files.

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. That is a different error than we received last time. This seems to have gotten further in the scanning process but can't identify the database files. Before running the Bulk Import was the FSAC System scan run first?  If you navigate to the file path below for the host that's throwing that error are there any StatsFSAC.fsaadb and StrucFSAC.fsaadb files for that host?

Program Files (x86)StealthAuditFSAA

Could you also verify that the StructMap file exists in that location as well?

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Since the database job group is running it will most likely lock the tables up if you try to run a repair with that job running. If you can stop the job, run the repair tool, and the restart both the database and the FSAC system scan that would be best.

Thank you,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Identified that the FSAC system scans are erroring out on a host ""Unable to start scan"". We have verified that the agent is collecting activity by testing a file creation and deletion. We also verified that the events are successfully being sent to a SIEM as well.

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the current scheduled jobs to finish. Then run the repair tool on the desired host. This can be accessed at the location below:

[Repair tool]

Once the repair has been completed please run the FSAC System Scan and Bulk Import on the desired host and provide an update to the results of the scan job.

I am not seeing the file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. I can see it on some of the jobs but not on all of them. I have other issues like the activity monitor that feeds to my Qradar are not giving the data that I know it should be giving.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application, you have FSAA jobs that collect file system permissions and FSAC jobs that collect file system activity. In the ticket description, you mentioned that you were not able to view file data from the current file server. Is that type of data file system activity or permissions? If you're tracking file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. This would utilize the Activity Monitor agents and we would start troubleshooting this issue there. If it's permissions data that you're not seeing then verifying whether you're using proxies would be a great start there.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

If it is permissions file system data are you using proxies?

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to connect with me via Zoom today. Upon connecting to the meeting, it was brought to my attention that the product you're experiencing issues with is Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which is a separate entity from Netwrix Auditor. I will be working to get you connected with a member of the Enterprise Auditor team as soon as possible. I thank you again for taking the time to explain some of the issues you were experiencing on our call today, and I will make best efforts to relay what we covered to the engineer that gets assigned your case. I appreciate your patience in the interim.

Regards,

1. Are you looking to run a report to identify a specific file and the time/date files from that server were deleted? If so, do you have a general idea of the range of time they were deleted? Yes

2. Additionally, is this ""current"" file server a new addition to your file server auditing monitoring plan, or has it been in place for awhile? No it has been there for a while

3. Are other actions such as files being added, read, modified, etc being shown for the ""current"" file server when performing a search in Netwrix Auditor? No I get not DATA

4. Has auditing for this ""current"" file server ever worked properly, or is this a new addition to your monitoring plan you're aiming to get configured?  Yes before the upgrade and since I got the issues fixed it seem to work but now I get no data.

Scottie,

 

I get the activity from the file server now but not from the SQL server or Active Directory. When I search for the Data on a server I still do not get the data there also. 

 

Thanks

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Performed an upgrade on the AIC to the latest available version (11.6.0.25) by performing the process mentioned in the documentation below:

Upgrade Procedure

Once the upgrade process was successfully completed we were able to view recent file system activity in the AIC on the desired hosts. 

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the File System 0.Collections job group to run through the scheduled tasks and verify that the information is displayed in the AIC if there are any new or updated file system activity or permission changes.

I will:

Continue to keep this ticket in an postponed reply status and I will reach out tomorrow for a status update on the AIC and FSAC system scan jobs. 

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. That is an older version of the 11.6 AIC. I think upgrading the AIC to the latest version will resolve the issue of not being able to view that information in the web console. I recommend performing a snapshot of the application server and verifying the credentials that are used to run the services for the AIC.

If you would like to schedule a meeting you may use the link below:

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you try running the FSAC system scan again on that host? I was able to test in my lab by removing the Stats and Struc FSAC.fsaadb files and running the FSAC system scan again to create those files.

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. That is a different error than we received last time. This seems to have gotten further in the scanning process but can't identify the database files. Before running the Bulk Import was the FSAC System scan run first?  If you navigate to the file path below for the host that's throwing that error are there any StatsFSAC.fsaadb and StrucFSAC.fsaadb files for that host?

Program Files (x86)StealthAuditFSAA

Could you also verify that the StructMap file exists in that location as well?

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Since the database job group is running it will most likely lock the tables up if you try to run a repair with that job running. If you can stop the job, run the repair tool, and the restart both the database and the FSAC system scan that would be best.

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Identified that the FSAC system scans are erroring out on a host ""Unable to start scan"". We have verified that the agent is collecting activity by testing a file creation and deletion. We also verified that the events are successfully being sent to a SIEM as well. 

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the current scheduled jobs to finish. Then run the repair tool on the desired host. This can be accessed at the location below:

[Inline image name : image006.png]

Once the repair has been completed please run the FSAC System Scan and Bulk Import on the desired host and provide an update to the results of the scan job.

Thank you,

I am not seeing the file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. I can see it on some of the jobs but not on all of them. I have other issues like the activity monitor that feeds to my Qradar are not giving the data that I know it should be giving.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application, you have FSAA jobs that collect file system permissions and FSAC jobs that collect file system activity. In the ticket description, you mentioned that you were not able to view file data from the current file server. Is that type of data file system activity or permissions? If you're tracking file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. This would utilize the Activity Monitor agents and we would start troubleshooting this issue there. If it's permissions data that you're not seeing then verifying whether you're using proxies would be a great start there. 

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thank you,

Not sure what you mean by this “this file activity or is this permissions-based file data”.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. Is this file activity or is this permissions-based file data?

If it is permissions file system data are you using proxies?

Thank you,

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to connect with me via Zoom today. Upon connecting to the meeting, it was brought to my attention that the product you're experiencing issues with is Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which is a separate entity from Netwrix Auditor. I will be working to get you connected with a member of the Enterprise Auditor team as soon as possible. I thank you again for taking the time to explain some of the issues you were experiencing on our call today, and I will make best efforts to relay what we covered to the engineer that gets assigned your case. I appreciate your patience in the interim. 

Regards,
Trever McConnell, Technical Support Engineer

1. Are you looking to run a report to identify a specific file and the time/date files from that server were deleted? If so, do you have a general idea of the range of time they were deleted? Yes 

2. Additionally, is this ""current"" file server a new addition to your file server auditing monitoring plan, or has it been in place for awhile? No it has been there for a while

3. Are other actions such as files being added, read, modified, etc being shown for the ""current"" file server when performing a search in Netwrix Auditor? No I get not DATA

4. Has auditing for this ""current"" file server ever worked properly, or is this a new addition to your monitoring plan you're aiming to get configured?  Yes before the upgrade and since I got the issues fixed it seem to work but now I get no data.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you please provide screenshots of the data you're trying to view in the AIC? A screenshot from the NEA console under the results node for the specific job you're trying to review this data on as well as a screenshot from the AIC not during a search for comparison. Can you also provide job logs from each job that you're experiencing this issue with?

Thank you,

Scottie,

I get the activity from the file server now but not from the SQL server or Active Directory. When I search for the Data on a server I still do not get the data there also.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Performed an upgrade on the AIC to the latest available version (11.6.0.25) by performing the process mentioned in the documentation below:

Upgrade Procedure<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm>

Once the upgrade process was successfully completed we were able to view recent file system activity in the AIC on the desired hosts.

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the File System 0.Collections job group to run through the scheduled tasks and verify that the information is displayed in the AIC if there are any new or updated file system activity or permission changes.

I will:

Continue to keep this ticket in an postponed reply status and I will reach out tomorrow for a status update on the AIC and FSAC system scan jobs.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. That is an older version of the 11.6 AIC. I think upgrading the AIC to the latest version will resolve the issue of not being able to view that information in the web console. I recommend performing a snapshot of the application server and verifying the credentials that are used to run the services for the AIC.

If you would like to schedule a meeting you may use the link below:

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you try running the FSAC system scan again on that host? I was able to test in my lab by removing the Stats and Struc FSAC.fsaadb files and running the FSAC system scan again to create those files.

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. That is a different error than we received last time. This seems to have gotten further in the scanning process but can't identify the database files. Before running the Bulk Import was the FSAC System scan run first?  If you navigate to the file path below for the host that's throwing that error are there any StatsFSAC.fsaadb and StrucFSAC.fsaadb files for that host?

Program Files (x86)StealthAuditFSAA

Could you also verify that the StructMap file exists in that location as well?

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Since the database job group is running it will most likely lock the tables up if you try to run a repair with that job running. If you can stop the job, run the repair tool, and the restart both the database and the FSAC system scan that would be best.

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Identified that the FSAC system scans are erroring out on a host ""Unable to start scan"". We have verified that the agent is collecting activity by testing a file creation and deletion. We also verified that the events are successfully being sent to a SIEM as well.

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the current scheduled jobs to finish. Then run the repair tool on the desired host. This can be accessed at the location below:

[Repair tool]

Once the repair has been completed please run the FSAC System Scan and Bulk Import on the desired host and provide an update to the results of the scan job.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor
Technical Support Engineer

I am not seeing the file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. I can see it on some of the jobs but not on all of them. I have other issues like the activity monitor that feeds to my Qradar are not giving the data that I know it should be giving.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application, you have FSAA jobs that collect file system permissions and FSAC jobs that collect file system activity. In the ticket description, you mentioned that you were not able to view file data from the current file server. Is that type of data file system activity or permissions? If you're tracking file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. This would utilize the Activity Monitor agents and we would start troubleshooting this issue there. If it's permissions data that you're not seeing then verifying whether you're using proxies would be a great start there.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

1. Are you looking to run a report to identify a specific file and the time/date files from that server were deleted? If so, do you have a general idea of the range of time they were deleted? Yes

2. Additionally, is this ""current"" file server a new addition to your file server auditing monitoring plan, or has it been in place for awhile? No it has been there for a while

3. Are other actions such as files being added, read, modified, etc being shown for the ""current"" file server when performing a search in Netwrix Auditor? No I get not DATA

4. Has auditing for this ""current"" file server ever worked properly, or is this a new addition to your monitoring plan you're aiming to get configured?  Yes before the upgrade and since I got the issues fixed it seem to work but now I get no data.

Thank you for the updated information. Can you provide a screenshot of each view listed under the SQL_Activity job and set it to ""Do not filter data"" as well as a screenshot of the job stats and the task stats? This would be the SQLServer_Activity_Details, SQLServer_Activity_UserDatabaseSummary, and the SQLServer_Activity_UserInstanceSummary. This will help determine if the data is being written to the database and collected within the NEA console.

Thank you,

Can you also provide job logs from each job that you're experiencing this issue with? There  a lot of them so if we could just view them.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you please provide screenshots of the data you're trying to view in the AIC? A screenshot from the NEA console under the results node for the specific job you're trying to review this data on as well as a screenshot from the AIC not during a search for comparison. Can you also provide job logs from each job that you're experiencing this issue with?

Thank you,

Scottie,

 

I get the activity from the file server now but not from the SQL server or Active Directory. When I search for the Data on a server I still do not get the data there also. 

 

Thanks

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Performed an upgrade on the AIC to the latest available version (11.6.0.25) by performing the process mentioned in the documentation below:

Upgrade Procedure

Once the upgrade process was successfully completed we were able to view recent file system activity in the AIC on the desired hosts. 

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the File System 0.Collections job group to run through the scheduled tasks and verify that the information is displayed in the AIC if there are any new or updated file system activity or permission changes.

I will:

Continue to keep this ticket in an postponed reply status and I will reach out tomorrow for a status update on the AIC and FSAC system scan jobs. 

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. That is an older version of the 11.6 AIC. I think upgrading the AIC to the latest version will resolve the issue of not being able to view that information in the web console. I recommend performing a snapshot of the application server and verifying the credentials that are used to run the services for the AIC.

If you would like to schedule a meeting you may use the link below:

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you try running the FSAC system scan again on that host? I was able to test in my lab by removing the Stats and Struc FSAC.fsaadb files and running the FSAC system scan again to create those files.

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. That is a different error than we received last time. This seems to have gotten further in the scanning process but can't identify the database files. Before running the Bulk Import was the FSAC System scan run first?  If you navigate to the file path below for the host that's throwing that error are there any StatsFSAC.fsaadb and StrucFSAC.fsaadb files for that host?

Program Files (x86)StealthAuditFSAA

Could you also verify that the StructMap file exists in that location as well?

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Since the database job group is running it will most likely lock the tables up if you try to run a repair with that job running. If you can stop the job, run the repair tool, and the restart both the database and the FSAC system scan that would be best.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Identified that the FSAC system scans are erroring out on a host ""Unable to start scan"". We have verified that the agent is collecting activity by testing a file creation and deletion. We also verified that the events are successfully being sent to a SIEM as well. 

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the current scheduled jobs to finish. Then run the repair tool on the desired host. This can be accessed at the location below:

I am not seeing the file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. I can see it on some of the jobs but not on all of them. I have other issues like the activity monitor that feeds to my Qradar are not giving the data that I know it should be giving.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application, you have FSAA jobs that collect file system permissions and FSAC jobs that collect file system activity. In the ticket description, you mentioned that you were not able to view file data from the current file server. Is that type of data file system activity or permissions? If you're tracking file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. This would utilize the Activity Monitor agents and we would start troubleshooting this issue there. If it's permissions data that you're not seeing then verifying whether you're using proxies would be a great start there. 

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Not sure what you mean by this “this file activity or is this permissions-based file data”.

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to connect with me via Zoom today. Upon connecting to the meeting, it was brought to my attention that the product you're experiencing issues with is Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which is a separate entity from Netwrix Auditor. I will be working to get you connected with a member of the Enterprise Auditor team as soon as possible. I thank you again for taking the time to explain some of the issues you were experiencing on our call today, and I will make best efforts to relay what we covered to the engineer that gets assigned your case. I appreciate your patience in the interim. 

Regards,
Trever McConnell, Technical Support Engineer

1. Are you looking to run a report to identify a specific file and the time/date files from that server were deleted? If so, do you have a general idea of the range of time they were deleted? Yes 

2. Additionally, is this ""current"" file server a new addition to your file server auditing monitoring plan, or has it been in place for awhile? No it has been there for a while

3. Are other actions such as files being added, read, modified, etc being shown for the ""current"" file server when performing a search in Netwrix Auditor? No I get not DATA

4. Has auditing for this ""current"" file server ever worked properly, or is this a new addition to your monitoring plan you're aiming to get configured?  Yes before the upgrade and since I got the issues fixed it seem to work but now I get no data.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you provide a screenshot of each view listed under the SQL_Activity job and set it to ""Do not filter data"" as well as a screenshot of the job stats and the task stats? This would be the SQLServer_Activity_Details, SQLServer_Activity_UserDatabaseSummary, and the SQLServer_Activity_UserInstanceSummary. This will help determine if the data is being written to the database and collected within the NEA console.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you please provide screenshots of the data you're trying to view in the AIC? A screenshot from the NEA console under the results node for the specific job you're trying to review this data on as well as a screenshot from the AIC not during a search for comparison. Can you also provide job logs from each job that you're experiencing this issue with?

Thank you,

Scottie,

I get the activity from the file server now but not from the SQL server or Active Directory. When I search for the Data on a server I still do not get the data there also.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Performed an upgrade on the AIC to the latest available version (11.6.0.25) by performing the process mentioned in the documentation below:

Upgrade Procedure<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm>

Once the upgrade process was successfully completed we were able to view recent file system activity in the AIC on the desired hosts.

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the File System 0.Collections job group to run through the scheduled tasks and verify that the information is displayed in the AIC if there are any new or updated file system activity or permission changes.

I will:

Continue to keep this ticket in an postponed reply status and I will reach out tomorrow for a status update on the AIC and FSAC system scan jobs.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. That is an older version of the 11.6 AIC. I think upgrading the AIC to the latest version will resolve the issue of not being able to view that information in the web console. I recommend performing a snapshot of the application server and verifying the credentials that are used to run the services for the AIC.

If you would like to schedule a meeting you may use the link below:

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you try running the FSAC system scan again on that host? I was able to test in my lab by removing the Stats and Struc FSAC.fsaadb files and running the FSAC system scan again to create those files.

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. That is a different error than we received last time. This seems to have gotten further in the scanning process but can't identify the database files. Before running the Bulk Import was the FSAC System scan run first?  If you navigate to the file path below for the host that's throwing that error are there any StatsFSAC.fsaadb and StrucFSAC.fsaadb files for that host?

Program Files (x86)StealthAuditFSAA

Could you also verify that the StructMap file exists in that location as well?

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Since the database job group is running it will most likely lock the tables up if you try to run a repair with that job running. If you can stop the job, run the repair tool, and the restart both the database and the FSAC system scan that would be best.

Thank you,

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the current scheduled jobs to finish. Then run the repair tool on the desired host. This can be accessed at the location below:

[Repair tool]

Once the repair has been completed please run the FSAC System Scan and Bulk Import on the desired host and provide an update to the results of the scan job.

Thank you,

I am not seeing the file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. I can see it on some of the jobs but not on all of them. I have other issues like the activity monitor that feeds to my Qradar are not giving the data that I know it should be giving.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application, you have FSAA jobs that collect file system permissions and FSAC jobs that collect file system activity. In the ticket description, you mentioned that you were not able to view file data from the current file server. Is that type of data file system activity or permissions? If you're tracking file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. This would utilize the Activity Monitor agents and we would start troubleshooting this issue there. If it's permissions data that you're not seeing then verifying whether you're using proxies would be a great start there.

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you. Is this file activity or is this permissions-based file data?

If it is permissions file system data are you using proxies?

Hello Glenda,

Thank you for taking the time to connect with me via Zoom today. Upon connecting to the meeting, it was brought to my attention that the product you're experiencing issues with is Netwrix Enterprise Auditor, which is a separate entity from Netwrix Auditor. I will be working to get you connected with a member of the Enterprise Auditor team as soon as possible. I thank you again for taking the time to explain some of the issues you were experiencing on our call today, and I will make best efforts to relay what we covered to the engineer that gets assigned your case. I appreciate your patience in the interim.

Regards,
Trever McConnell, Technical Support Engineer

1. Are you looking to run a report to identify a specific file and the time/date files from that server were deleted? If so, do you have a general idea of the range of time they were deleted? Yes

2. Additionally, is this ""current"" file server a new addition to your file server auditing monitoring plan, or has it been in place for awhile? No it has been there for a while

3. Are other actions such as files being added, read, modified, etc being shown for the ""current"" file server when performing a search in Netwrix Auditor? No I get not DATA

4. Has auditing for this ""current"" file server ever worked properly, or is this a new addition to your monitoring plan you're aiming to get configured?  Yes before the upgrade and since I got the issues fixed it seem to work but now I get no data.","RE: [External]RE: [External]RE: [External]RE: [External]RE: [External]RE: [External]RE: [External]RE: [External]RE: [External]RE: [External]RE: [External]RE: [External]RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #424717 -  - [External]file deletion    [     [ ref:!00D7009","gcoley@eglinfcu.org","Glenda Coley","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","true","2024-11-05T19:20:46.000Z","true"

Thank you for the updated information. If NEA hasn't collected any SQL activity then it will not be displayed in AIC. From the screenshots, there doesn't seem to have been any activity recorded in the last 30 days. By default this job is designed to retain 30 days of data. Could you verify that a SQL host is added to the job and test activity with a known account that has access to the SQL database or database instance?

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you provide a screenshot of each view listed under the SQL_Activity job and set it to ""Do not filter data"" as well as a screenshot of the job stats and the task stats? This would be the SQLServer_Activity_Details, SQLServer_Activity_UserDatabaseSummary, and the SQLServer_Activity_UserInstanceSummary. This will help determine if the data is being written to the database and collected within the NEA console.

Thank you,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you please provide screenshots of the data you're trying to view in the AIC? A screenshot from the NEA console under the results node for the specific job you're trying to review this data on as well as a screenshot from the AIC not during a search for comparison. Can you also provide job logs from each job that you're experiencing this issue with?

Thank you,

Scottie,

 

I get the activity from the file server now but not from the SQL server or Active Directory. When I search for the Data on a server I still do not get the data there also. 

 

Thanks

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Performed an upgrade on the AIC to the latest available version (11.6.0.25) by performing the process mentioned in the documentation below:

Upgrade Procedure

Once the upgrade process was successfully completed we were able to view recent file system activity in the AIC on the desired hosts. 

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the File System 0.Collections job group to run through the scheduled tasks and verify that the information is displayed in the AIC if there are any new or updated file system activity or permission changes.

I will:

Continue to keep this ticket in an postponed reply status and I will reach out tomorrow for a status update on the AIC and FSAC system scan jobs. 

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. I will include this in the ticket. That is an older version of the 11.6 AIC. I think upgrading the AIC to the latest version will resolve the issue of not being able to view that information in the web console. I recommend performing a snapshot of the application server and verifying the credentials that are used to run the services for the AIC.

If you would like to schedule a meeting you may use the link below:

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Can you try running the FSAC system scan again on that host? I was able to test in my lab by removing the Stats and Struc FSAC.fsaadb files and running the FSAC system scan again to create those files.

Thank you,

FSAC System scan was ran first yes.

 

No StatsFSAC.fsaadb and StrucFSAC.fsaadb files for that host.

No the StructMap file  does not exists in that location.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. That is a different error than we received last time. This seems to have gotten further in the scanning process but can't identify the database files. Before running the Bulk Import was the FSAC System scan run first?  If you navigate to the file path below for the host that's throwing that error are there any StatsFSAC.fsaadb and StrucFSAC.fsaadb files for that host?

Program Files (x86)StealthAuditFSAA

Could you also verify that the StructMap file exists in that location as well?

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Since the database job group is running it will most likely lock the tables up if you try to run a repair with that job running. If you can stop the job, run the repair tool, and the restart both the database and the FSAC system scan that would be best.

Thank you,

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support regarding your issue. I would be happy to assist you.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Identified that the FSAC system scans are erroring out on a host ""Unable to start scan"". We have verified that the agent is collecting activity by testing a file creation and deletion. We also verified that the events are successfully being sent to a SIEM as well. 

Our next steps are:

You will:

Allow the current scheduled jobs to finish. Then run the repair tool on the desired host. This can be accessed at the location below:

[Inline image name : image016.png]

Once the repair has been completed please run the FSAC System Scan and Bulk Import on the desired host and provide an update to the results of the scan job.

Thank you,

I am not seeing the file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. I can see it on some of the jobs but not on all of them. I have other issues like the activity monitor that feeds to my Qradar are not giving the data that I know it should be giving.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Within the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor application, you have FSAA jobs that collect file system permissions and FSAC jobs that collect file system activity. In the ticket description, you mentioned that you were not able to view file data from the current file server. Is that type of data file system activity or permissions? If you're tracking file system activity, which would be different operations like read, write, added, delete etc. This would utilize the Activity Monitor agents and we would start troubleshooting this issue there. If it's permissions data that you're not seeing then verifying whether you're using proxies would be a great start there. 

Please let me know if you have any additional questions.

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Not sure what you mean by this “this file activity or is this permissions-based file data”.

I'm not sure if you received my last email in response to the SQL activity. I have provided that response below:

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. If NEA hasn't collected any SQL activity then it will not be displayed in AIC. From the screenshots, there doesn't seem to have been any activity recorded in the last 30 days. By default this job is designed to retain 30 days of data. Could you verify that a SQL host is added to the job and test activity with a known account that has access to the SQL database or database instance?

Thank you,

I'm not sure if you received my last email in response to the SQL activity. I have provided that response below:

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. If NEA hasn't collected any SQL activity then it will not be displayed in AIC. From the screenshots, there doesn't seem to have been any activity recorded in the last 30 days. By default this job is designed to retain 30 days of data. Could you verify that a SQL host is added to the job and test activity with a known account that has access to the SQL database or database instance?

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor
Technical Support Engineer

Thank you for the updated information. That would need to be a completely separate ticket from this ticket since those are two different jobs with different data collectors. Additionally, we confirmed that the NEA console is also not receiving any data. Since the NEA console hasn't received any data for that SQL job there won't be any data indexed into those tables on the SQL server side. Since there's nothing to import the AIC has nothing to view. We can investigate this issue further on a separate ticket. 

Thank you,

Thank you for the updated information. A full health check will need to be conducted by our professional services team in conjunction with your account owner. You will need to reach out to your account owner to request a full health check and they will schedule a time with professional services to perform the full health check. Please keep in mind that they request that you do not have any open or ongoing tickets before submitting that request. 

Thank you,

Ok How do I get a real health check on this system I have been putting in tickets and it is still having issues with a lot of stuff. Please let me know how I can get someone to go through this and straighten things out so I can start getting the data I got before it was upgraded.

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. That would need to be a completely separate ticket from this ticket since those are two different jobs with different data collectors. Additionally, we confirmed that the NEA console is also not receiving any data. Since the NEA console hasn't received any data for that SQL job there won't be any data indexed into those tables on the SQL server side. Since there's nothing to import the AIC has nothing to view. We can investigate this issue further on a separate ticket. 

Thank you,

Scottie Taylor

Hi Glenda,

Thank you for the updated information. Since we have resolved the file system scan issue and the file system results populating in the AIC I will close this ticket since the original issue has been resolved. If you experience any other issue please don't hesitate to reach out or create a new ticket for the issue you're experiencing. 

Thank you,
