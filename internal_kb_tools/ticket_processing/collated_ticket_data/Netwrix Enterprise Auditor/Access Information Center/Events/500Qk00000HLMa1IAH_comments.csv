"00aQk000009ruN3IAI","500Qk00000HLMa1IAH","Re-adding my comment here, as the R&D Comments section was unavailable yesterday. I added the following under a post yesterday:

Just met with this customer, this case was submitted with the product name being designated as Netwrix Auditor, not Netwrix Enterprise Auditor. The responses to my opening questions did not allude to the product in question being anything but Netwirx Auditor.

 

The customer was frustrated upon getting on Zoom before I told her I was ill equipped to assist her. She asked for a meeting ""ASAP"" so for whoever gets this case, please do feel free to connect with me if you'd like to see a copy of the Zoom recording as the customer did spend some time articulating to me specifically what issues they're experiencing.

 

As a result of this being an invalid product for yours truly, I am reassigning to TL queue.","0054u000008AfEfAAK","2024-10-25T17:05:26.000Z","2024-10-25T17:05:26.000Z","false","false"
