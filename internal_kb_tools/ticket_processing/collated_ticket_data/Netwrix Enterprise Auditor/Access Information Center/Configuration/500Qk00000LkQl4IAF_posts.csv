We've been using the resource audit section within the AIC a lot more recently for file server activity searches and audits. I see that there is a limit of showing 100k rows within the activity details pane. Is there any way to extend this limit so we can export a report of all events? I see that we can filter out certain items to reduce them in the results pane, but once we do that we cannot export the results - those options disappear (which I assume is by design?). thanks for the help here!
