Looking for your guidance here with a particular auditing request we received due to a missing folder. Typically, we search for file/folder deletions and/or renames to track down the event. In this particular case, we were able to find the rename event in the Activity Monitor. It also showed us the new folder name and location. However, when we search for that same rename in the AIC under Resource Audit, we only found the rename time, date, and user details related to this action. It does not display the new folder name for us. 
We only keep 21 days of events in the Activity Monitor for this particular file server, so my concern is that if this event happens outside that retention period >21days, how can we properly find this event in the AIC, with all of the relevant details? I will attach the screenshots from both platforms for reference. Appreciate the help and guidance here! Doug","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-01T19:08:28.000Z"
