Impact:
An attacker can execute cross domain scripts on the application to perform attacks like XSS.

Recommendation:
1. Enable CSP on your website by sending the Content-Security-Policy in HTTP response
headers that instructs the browser to apply the policies you specified.
2. Implement CSP header as mentioned below:
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'; OR
<meta http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" content=""script-src 'self';"">
3. Apply the whitelist and policies as strict as possible.
