1) The original meeting invite was for configuring SSL for AIC.

2) Frank may also want to look at configuring SSL for:

NTM Reporting (for NEA/StealthAUDIT)
NTM (StealthDEFEND)

I can split it out the other 2 tickets afterwards.","","https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Secure.htm","","https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Secure.htm

2024_1213: Configure SSL for AIC
+++++

1) We had an extra character in the ""certhash"" value and netsh complained with the following error message = ""The parameter is incorrect"".  This is interpreted as our certhash parameter is incorrect.

+++++
Your security team may flag accessing your AIC based upon the certificate that you have now even though it supports secure SSL access.
Can you try to contact your IT department (and/or security team?) to request a proper certificate from your internal certificate authority?

We were able to secure access to AIC in my lab and remediate the ""Not Secure"" message but we were able to create our own certificate to match our FQDN.
