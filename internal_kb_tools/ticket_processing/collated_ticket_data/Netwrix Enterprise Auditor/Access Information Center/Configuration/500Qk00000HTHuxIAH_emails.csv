Hi,

 

I believe this scan is now running but I am unable to confirm f this has resolved the issue as we have another technical issue preventing us accessing the portal. I believe a separate ticket has been opened for this.

 

If you can keep this ticket open until next week please?

 

Regards,

Lorcan

Hi Lorcan,

Have you had a chance to check my previous email?

Were you able to run the AD Scan and check if you can select the other domain in AIC?

Hi Lorcan,

Thank you for your time.

Please make sure that the Host List assigned reflects all your necessary domains in it and then you can kick off the "".Active Directory Inventory"" group scan manually or on schedule. You can check if you have a scheduled task for this job here:

Hi, Yes the AD account that was created to run these jobs was disabled in our AD. This has now been re-enabled. What action needs to be done to get these scans going again?

I believe the scans are back up and running but I still see no change in the portal when trying to select an owner, I only see 'ICT'.

Thank you for the reply.

I think I found the root cause. You need to add non-ICT domains in the ""AuthSearchDomain"" field in the ""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.config"" file.
By default, it's located in the ""C:Program FilesStealthbitsAccess Information Center"" folder."

You can restart the service in Powershell.
Open Powershell as Administrator and run the following command: Restart-Service AccessInformationCenter

You can also open the Services console by typing ""services.msc"" in the search field near the Windows ""Start"" and restart the ""Netwrix Access Information Center"" service.

Hi Aleksandr,

The AIC has been restarted but this has not resolved the issue so I can still only see 'ICT' as an option.

I have checked on the CONFIG file and this seemed to have deleted the changes I made adding in the additional domains under 'AuthSearchDomains'.

I could update the file again but I am not sure if this will take affect once the AIC is restarted again.

Can you advise? Is there a way to have the changes take affect with the AIC being restarted?","Netwrix Support Ticket #425074 - Unable to add non-ICT domain owners in 'resource owners'","lorcan.osullivan@kerry.ie","Lorcan O'Sullivan","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2024-11-13T16:40:02.000Z","true"

Please try to change the config file again and ensure it is saved.
Sometimes this happens when you don't have enough permissions to save the file. Service restart should not remove your configurations.

Subject: Netwrix Support Ticket #425074 - Unable to add non-ICT domain owners in 'resource owners'

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000HTHux:ref

Hi Aleksandr,

The AIC has been restarted but this has not resolved the issue so I can still only see 'ICT' as an option.

I have checked on the CONFIG file and this seemed to have deleted the changes I made adding in the additional domains under 'AuthSearchDomains'.

I could update the file again but I am not sure if this will take affect once the AIC is restarted again.

Can you advise? Is there a way to have the changes take affect with the AIC being restarted?","RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #425074 - Unable to add non-ICT domain owners in 'resource owners'    [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0HTHux:ref ]","techsupport@netwrix.com","Netwrix Support","lorcan.osullivan@kerry.ie","georges.chahwan@netwrix.com","aleksandr.timofeev@netwrix.com","false","2024-11-14T06:15:46.000Z","true"

Are there any updates since the last email?

Have you tried to change the config again?

Hi Lorcan,

Please try to change the config file again and ensure it is saved.
Sometimes this happens when you don't have enough permissions to save the file. Service restart should not remove your configurations.

Hi Aleksandr, sorry about this as the portal was inaccessible for a few days. Its back up and I can now see the other options when searching for the resource owners. I think this ticket can be closed now.
