We then restarted the service but we were unable to actually start the service due to timeout. After rebooting the server, the service is running again.

Looks like the ADI scan has been erroring lately which matches up with the ""Unable to enumerate domain"" error we are seeing in the AIC log.

Set the ADI scan to use a different DC (LDAP errors on the one chosen by 1DCperDomain). This looked to be running successfully, but customer has 338k+ users so the job will take at least a couple of hours.
