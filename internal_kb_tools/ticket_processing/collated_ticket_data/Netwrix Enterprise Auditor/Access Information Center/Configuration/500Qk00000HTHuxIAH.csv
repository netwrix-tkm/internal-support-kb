Whereas previously I could see multiple domains. I can therefore only security an owner in ICT domain which should not be the case. This is a new issue and I was able to select from our multiple domains in the past.","","Domains were missing in the ""AuthSearchDomain"" field in the ""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.config"" file","Sent instructions","Added non-ICT domains in the ""AuthSearchDomain"" field in the ""AccessInformationCenter.Service.exe.config"" file.
