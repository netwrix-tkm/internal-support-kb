Impact:
The users of the web application can be tricked into clicking link to a malicious website
which will then frame a legitimate website and capture all the users’ keystrokes. All activity by
the user can be monitored and recorded by the attacker allowing a complete compromise of
the username, password, or any other sensitive inputs. Attacker can perform Click jacking
and Phishing attacks to capture the sensitive information.

Recommendation:
As a security best practice, we recommend to implement X-Frame Options - ‘SAMEORIGIN’
to allow framing only by pages from the same origin and CSP frame-ancestors through out
the application.
