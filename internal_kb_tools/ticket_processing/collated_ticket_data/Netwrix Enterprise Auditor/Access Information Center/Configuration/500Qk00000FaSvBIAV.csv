netsh http show sslcert
Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:LocalMachineMy |Select-Object -Property * |Sort-Object NotAfter |Sort-Object NotAfter -Descending |
Format-Table Thumbprint,Subject,FriendlyName, NotAfter -AutoSize

##netsh update SSL Cert based on the details from the above output

netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8082
$guid = ""bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8"" # This will be the same for all installations because it is a GUID from the built-in webserver application
$certHash = ""INSERT THUMBNAIL VALUE FROM STEP 2 BETWEEN QUOTES""

$port = ""8082"" # the default HTTPS port
""http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}"" | netsh
