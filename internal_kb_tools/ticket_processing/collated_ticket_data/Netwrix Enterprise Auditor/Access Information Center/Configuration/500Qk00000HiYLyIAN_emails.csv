Hi Johnnie,

The AIC needs to be upgraded whenever NEA is upgraded as they need to have compatible versions.
Below is the instructions on how to upgrade the AIC to 11.6.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm

If you would like help with this or have any questions please let me know and I'd be happy to assist.

HI Thanks you for the quick response

I am just trying to get a report that has the dept group – users in the group – and what the user has access to.
I was able to get something close to that in access information center. But when I installed Netwrix enterprise auditor I no longer have access information center.

Thanks

HI Thanks you for the quick response

I am just trying to get a report that has the dept group – users in the group – and what the user has access to.
I was able to get something close to that in access information center. But when I installed Netwrix enterprise auditor I no longer have access information center.

Thanks

Hi Johnnie,

The AIC needs to be upgraded whenever NEA is upgraded as they need to have compatible versions.
Below is the instructions on how to upgrade the AIC to 11.6.

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Installation/Upgrade.htm

If you would like help with this or have any questions please let me know and I'd be happy to assist.

Thank you,

Hi Johnny,

Can you give me the below info.

2. What version of AIC are you running currently.
3. What is the URL you are using to access the AIC interface
4. Is there an error generated when trying to access AIC and if so, what is the error.

Thank you,
