Frantz,

 

I noticed this ticket looks closed? Can you reopen and attach this email and logs? 

 

Meredith took the time to discover and document the issue so we are halfway there.  But we need the ticket open to do it. ðŸ˜Š

 

Thanks,

Mark

I just reviewed the last meeting we had with Meredith, and she mentioned that the issue was resolved. The groups showed up in AIC. She was supposed to monitor it and let us know if it resurfaced. If she has not reported any problems with those groups, that means the issue is resolved.
