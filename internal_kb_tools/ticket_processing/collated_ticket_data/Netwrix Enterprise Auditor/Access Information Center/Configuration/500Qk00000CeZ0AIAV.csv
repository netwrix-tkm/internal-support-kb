"500Qk00000CeZ0AIAV","00414022","Support Ticket","Error when accessing 'access' tab","When using stealth audit web interface from a remote machine, I get the error ""unable to validate your session"" when clicking on the access tab. When on the stealth bits server, it works fine.
I will be OOO until 7/8.","","","","[Issue]
The ""Access"" tab in the :8082 Published Reports site is error with ""Unable to validate your session""

[Root Cause]
The certificate bound to ports 8082 (Published Reports) and :481 (Access Information Center) is no longer valid.

[Resolution]
Our current workaround is to use the https://+:481 site to access the AIC directly. Once you have a new certificate, you can follow the instructions outlined in the article below to update the certificate bound to port 8082 AND 481. Updating the certificates should allow you to use the access tab again.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix server","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","Access Information Center","Configuration","11.5","","7.7","Closed - Resolved","CPP Corp","Benjamin Tanner","2024-07-03T23:31:30.000Z","2024-07-11T15:25:37.000Z"
