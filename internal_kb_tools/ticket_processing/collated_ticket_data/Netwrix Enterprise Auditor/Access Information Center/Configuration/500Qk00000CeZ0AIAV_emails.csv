Thank you for reaching out to Netwrix support.

To begin our investigation please provide the following details:
A summary of installed Software - run this command from an admin Powershell prompt:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

	When did it start to happen? Was it working before?
	Does this issue happen when you directly access AIC from a remote computer?
	Please share the AIC logs for investigation located in :inetpubwwwrootStealthAUDIT ComplianceApp_Data folder.

I will reassign this ticket to a support engineer from your region.

The access tab is just a shortcut to the Netwrix Access Information Center. The URL for that is typically the same as the link to the publish reports, but port 81 or 481.

Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, 

[Issue]
The ""Access"" tab in the :8082 Published Reports site is error with ""Unable to validate your session""

[Root Cause]
The certificate bounds to ports 8082 (Published Reports) and :481 (Access Information Center) is no longer valid.

[Resolution]
Our current workaround is to use the https://+:481 site to access the AIC directly. Once you have a new certificate, you can follow the instructions outlined in the article below to update the certificate bound to port 8082 AND 481:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/z-kb-articles-salesforce/page/kA04u0000000ITtCAM.html

Updating the certificates should allow you to use the access tab again.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri
