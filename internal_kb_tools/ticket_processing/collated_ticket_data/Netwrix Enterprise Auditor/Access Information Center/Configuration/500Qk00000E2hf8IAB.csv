"500Qk00000E2hf8IAB","00417124","Support Ticket","StealthAudit and port 80","Seems the StealthAudit app is keeping port 80 in use on the Windows server it's installed on. I believe the documentation states it's for FileSystem related jobs for NetApp.  Is there a way we can a) confirm no other jobs/functionality is needed for that port 80 , and then b) can we disable port 80 from being used entirely? 

Our Cyber Sec team is wanting to shut down port 80 if at all possible from being used. Thanks.","","","","Looked at the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                11.6.0.75
Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC)      11.6.0.14

Found that the Port in question 80 was liked to the no longer utilized IIS.
