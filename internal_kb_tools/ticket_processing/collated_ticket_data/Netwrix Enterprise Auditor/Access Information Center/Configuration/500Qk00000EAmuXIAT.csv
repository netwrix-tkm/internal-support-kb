"500Qk00000EAmuXIAT","00417555","Support Ticket","AIC not working as expected after upgrade [PERN]","Hello,

We upgraded Enterprise Auditor core and Access Information Center to the latest versions (11.6) recently at PERN and now there are some issues with this portal:
- Polish translation not working for Manage Access and Access Request 
- Admin users from AD cannot login to the portal (only built-in admin works)
- One option is missed from the portal - Owners cannot change access to resources 

Sending logs from the client env and we need to quickly resolve that in Monday - last date. If not, client will restore previous version from snapshot, which is very unconviniet for us.

Could we schedule a session together on Monday?

Regards,
Adam","","","","Issue

Cause
