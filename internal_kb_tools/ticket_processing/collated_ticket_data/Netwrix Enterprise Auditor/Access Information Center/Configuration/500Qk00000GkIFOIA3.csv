"500Qk00000GkIFOIA3","00423193","Support Ticket","Getting Sorry we are unable to complete this request right now","When adding/removing computers to certain AD Group in AIC, get an error when attempting to commit the change. It says Sorry we are unable to complete this request right now. 
The groups in question
APCarbon Black Migration
EUEU Carbon Black Migration
USECarbon Black Migration
USWCarbon Black Migration

I seem to be able to add/remove computers and users to other AD groups. Using the service account credentials, I'm able to perform the changes using Active Directory Users and Computers so I don't know why the <a href='https://aic.log' target='_blank'>aic.log</a> reports Message: Access is denied.","","","","Symptom
When attempting to add a user to an AD group using AIC, an error is thrown indicating ""the task cannot be performed right now""
Logs indicate that there is a permissions issue when trying to add a user to a group.

Cause
The service account being used by AIC does not have sufficient privileges to modify the group in question.

Resolution
Update permissions on the service account following documentation to ensure that the user has minimum required permissions to make modifications.
