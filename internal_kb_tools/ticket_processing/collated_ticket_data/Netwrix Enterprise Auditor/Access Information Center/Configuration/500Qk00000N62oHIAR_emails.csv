Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session we reviewed the level of access you would like to grant to a specific security group in the Access Information Center. You would like users in the group to view full list of created Resource Reviews and their status. Unfortunately, I don't know if it is possible to grant visibility to all of the resource reviews without also granting permission to make changes.

Like we discussed, I'm going to do some research to see if there's a way to create custom roles in the Access Information Center like there is for some of our other products.

I will let you know as soon as I have determined one way or another. I'm sorry for the delay.

Thank you,

I appreciate your patience with this. I've confirmed that there is currently no way to grant the level of access you would like. The AIC does not support custom roles, and the only existing roles that allow viewing Resource Reviews and their statuses also grant the ability to create, edit, and delete reviews.

I have submitted a feature request on your behalf.  I'm sorry I wasn't able to help more.

Did you have any other questions I can help with?
