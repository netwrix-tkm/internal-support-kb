Thank you for meeting with me today. To recap our session, we:

	Bound the AIC certificate to port 481
	Re-installed the AIC on the NEA server
	Restarted the AIC service after updating the configuration file to tell the AIC to use port 481
	
		We ran into an error when the service was trying to start so we rebooted the system which allowed the service to start running
	
	
	Found the Active Directory Inventory wasn't successfully scanning so we temporarily switched the host to a different DC and it was running successfully


Let me know if you're able to log into the AIC after the Active Directory Inventory scan completes.

​​​​​​​Thank you,
