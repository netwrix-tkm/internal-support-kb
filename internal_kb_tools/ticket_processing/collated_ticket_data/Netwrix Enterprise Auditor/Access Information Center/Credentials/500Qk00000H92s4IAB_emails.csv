Hi Ilya,

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

Thanks and Regards,

Hi Ilya,

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users.

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access.

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well.

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

Praveen,

Before we do that, can you please access the attached image's link from the server where you can't see it?
The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Yes, it do not have Internet connection. U the email will be sent internally and that is accessible.

Emails are reaching to end users box, but only the images are not loading.

Let’s catch up once and we will show you the exact issue.

2) Enable Debug logging

I've also noticed you had a ticket regarding 'Change in configuration for Auto emails'. Is that connected to this case?

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

Hi Ilya,

 

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

 

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well. 

 

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

 

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

 

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

 

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

Hi Ilya,

 

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

 

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Hi Ilya,

 

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users. 

 

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

 

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

Thanks and Regards,

The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Hi Ilya,

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users.

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access.

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well.

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:

<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">

(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)

For files (PDF):
 

<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">
    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>
</object>

(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)

This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Hi Ilya,

 

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

 

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Hi Ilya,

 

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users. 

 

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

 

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

 

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

 

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well. 

 

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Yes, it do not have Internet connection. U the email will be sent internally and that is accessible.

 

Emails are reaching to end users box, but only the images are not loading.

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

 

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

 

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

 

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/<https://www.base64encode.org/>

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:



<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">



(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)

For files (PDF):




<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">

    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>

</object>



(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)

This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Ilya Kotov

Hi Ilya,

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users.

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

Waiting for the reply.

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access.

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well.

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Yes, it do not have Internet connection. U the email will be sent internally and that is accessible.

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

Praveen,

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:



<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">



 


(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):
 




 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>


</object>



 


(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)



This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Hi Ilya,

 

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

 

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

Praveen,

I suggest hosting these images on a separate, inter-company available server (e.g. Windows NFS) and using a new hard link in your templates. That would be much more easy to manage from your side and will also allow you to control who can see the images.
The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

 

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

 

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well. 

 

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Ilya,

 

Yes, it do not have Internet connection. U the email will be sent internally and that is accessible.

 

Emails are reaching to end users box, but only the images are not loading. 

 

Let’s catch up once and we will show you the exact issue.

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

 

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

 

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

 

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for your valuable suggestions. Please can we have someone from the technical team connect with us and perform the below mentioned configurations.

 

We don’t need any approvals for this we can easily configure and test the same.

 

Please arrange for a session.

Praveen,

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:



<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">


 


(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):
 



 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>


</object>


 


(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)



This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Ilya Kotov

Hi Ilya,

 

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

 

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

I suggest hosting these images on a separate, inter-company available server (e.g. Windows NFS) and using a new hard link in your templates. That would be much more easy to manage from your side and will also allow you to control who can see the images.
The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Hi Ilya,

 

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users. 

 

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

 

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

 

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

 

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well. 

 

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

 

Thanks and Regards,

 

Praveen V Huilgol

Praveen,

Before we do that, can you please access the attached image's link from the server where you can't see it?
The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Ilya,

 

Yes, it do not have Internet connection. U the email will be sent internally and that is accessible.

 

Emails are reaching to end users box, but only the images are not loading. 

 

Let’s catch up once and we will show you the exact issue.

1) Navigate here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Diagnostics.htm
2) Enable Debug logging

I've also noticed you had a ticket regarding 'Change in configuration for Auto emails'. Is that connected to this case?

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

 

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

 

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

 

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

 

Thanks and Regards,

On this meeting we ensured that the suggested solution works, the image file now embedded directly into the template. You've requested some time to test it on your end. I'll re-attach the code and explanations below just in case:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:


<img src=""data:image/png;base64,[HERE]"" alt=""Embedded Image"">






(replace [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)


For files (PDF):

 






<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"">here</a>.</p>


</object>






(replace BOTH instances of [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)

Praveen,

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:



<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">



 


(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):
 




 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>


</object>



 


(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)



This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Hi Ilya,

 

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

 

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

I suggest hosting these images on a separate, inter-company available server (e.g. Windows NFS) and using a new hard link in your templates. That would be much more easy to manage from your side and will also allow you to control who can see the images.
The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Hi Ilya,

 

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users. 

 

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

 

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

 

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

 

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well. 

 

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

 

Thanks and Regards,

 

Praveen V Huilgol

Praveen,

Before we do that, can you please access the attached image's link from the server where you can't see it?
The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Ilya,

 

Yes, it do not have Internet connection. U the email will be sent internally and that is accessible.

 

Emails are reaching to end users box, but only the images are not loading. 

 

Let’s catch up once and we will show you the exact issue.

Praveen,

We can surely meet but before that I'd like to see the debug logs. Steps to take:

1) Navigate here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Diagnostics.htm
2) Enable Debug logging
3) Preform the sendout of the email

I've also noticed you had a ticket regarding 'Change in configuration for Auto emails'. Is that connected to this case?

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

 

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

 

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

 

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

On this meeting we ensured that the suggested solution works, the image file now embedded directly into the template. You've requested some time to test it on your end. I'll re-attach the code and explanations below just in case:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:


<img src=""data:image/png;base64,[HERE]"" alt=""Embedded Image"">






(replace [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)


For files (PDF):

 






<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"">here</a>.</p>


</object>






(replace BOTH instances of [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for your valuable suggestions. Please can we have someone from the technical team connect with us and perform the below mentioned configurations.

 

We don’t need any approvals for this we can easily configure and test the same.

 

Please arrange for a session.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:



<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">


 


(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):
 



 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>


</object>


 


(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)



This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Hi Ilya,

 

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

 

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

I suggest hosting these images on a separate, inter-company available server (e.g. Windows NFS) and using a new hard link in your templates. That would be much more easy to manage from your side and will also allow you to control who can see the images.
The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Hi Ilya,

 

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users. 

 

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

 

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Hi Ilya,

 

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

 

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well. 

 

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

 

Thanks and Regards,

 

Praveen V Huilgol

Praveen,

Before we do that, can you please access the attached image's link from the server where you can't see it?
The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Best wishes,

Ilya,

 

Yes, it do not have Internet connection. U the email will be sent internally and that is accessible.

 

Emails are reaching to end users box, but only the images are not loading. 

 

Let’s catch up once and we will show you the exact issue.

1) Navigate here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Diagnostics.htm
2) Enable Debug logging

I've also noticed you had a ticket regarding 'Change in configuration for Auto emails'. Is that connected to this case?

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

 

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

 

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

 

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

On this meeting we ensured that the suggested solution works, the image file now embedded directly into the template. You've requested some time to test it on your end. I'll re-attach the code and explanations below just in case:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/<https://www.base64encode.org/ >

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:



<img src=""data:image/png;base64,[HERE]"" alt=""Embedded Image"">







(replace [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)

For files (PDF):









<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">



    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"">here</a>.</p>



</object>







(replace BOTH instances of [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)

Praveen,

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/<https://www.base64encode.org/ >

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:



<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">







(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)

For files (PDF):








<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">



    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>



</object>







(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)

This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Hi Ilya,

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

I suggest hosting these images on a separate, inter-company available server (e.g. Windows NFS) and using a new hard link in your templates. That would be much more easy to manage from your side and will also allow you to control who can see the images.
The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Hi Ilya,

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users.

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access.

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Hi Ilya,

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well.

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

Praveen,

Before we do that, can you please access the attached image's link from the server where you can't see it?
The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Yes, it do not have Internet connection. U the email will be sent internally and that is accessible.

Emails are reaching to end users box, but only the images are not loading.

Let’s catch up once and we will show you the exact issue.

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

Praveen,

On this meeting we ensured that the suggested solution works, the image file now embedded directly into the template. You've requested some time to test it on your end. I'll re-attach the code and explanations below just in case:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:




 


<img src=""data:image/png;base64,[HERE]"" alt=""Embedded Image"">



 


 



 


(replace [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):

 




 


 



 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">



 


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"">here</a>.</p>



 


</object>



 


 



 


(replace BOTH instances of [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)

Praveen,

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:




 


<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">



 


 



 


(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):
 




 


 



 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">



 


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>



 


</object>



 


 



 


(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)



This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Hi Ilya,

 

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

 

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

I suggest hosting these images on a separate, inter-company available server (e.g. Windows NFS) and using a new hard link in your templates. That would be much more easy to manage from your side and will also allow you to control who can see the images.
The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Hi Ilya,

 

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users. 

 

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

 

Waiting for the reply.

 

Thanks and Regards,

 

Praveen V Huilgol

IBM Security.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

 

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

 

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well. 

 

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

Before we do that, can you please access the attached image's link from the server where you can't see it?
The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Ilya,

 

Yes, it do not have Internet connection. U the email will be sent internally and that is accessible.

 

Emails are reaching to end users box, but only the images are not loading. 

 

Let’s catch up once and we will show you the exact issue.

1) Navigate here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Diagnostics.htm

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

 

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

 

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

 

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Hi Ilya,

Sorry for the delay. We need your support on this. As we discussed internally, we want PDF method to be configured and our team wants to connect with you and do it.

Since it is production, we cannot do any changes on the current setup without Vendor help.

Please check your calendar for a call and let us know. We will be joining the same.

Praveen,

On this meeting we ensured that the suggested solution works, the image file now embedded directly into the template. You've requested some time to test it on your end. I'll re-attach the code and explanations below just in case:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/<https://www.base64encode.org/ >

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:









<img src=""data:image/png;base64,[HERE]"" alt=""Embedded Image"">



















(replace [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)

For files (PDF):





















<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">









    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"">here</a>.</p>









</object>



















(replace BOTH instances of [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)

Praveen,

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/<https://www.base64encode.org/ >

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:









<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">



















(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)

For files (PDF):




















<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">









    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>









</object>



















(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)

This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Hi Ilya,

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen V Huilgol

The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Hi Ilya,

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users.

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access.

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well.

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

Hi Ilya,

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

Hi Ilya,

 

Sorry for the delay. We need your support on this. As we discussed internally, we want PDF method to be configured and our team wants to connect with you and do it.

 

Since it is production, we cannot do any changes on the current setup without Vendor help.

 

Please check your calendar for a call and let us know. We will be joining the same.

Praveen,

On this meeting we ensured that the suggested solution works, the image file now embedded directly into the template. You've requested some time to test it on your end. I'll re-attach the code and explanations below just in case:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:



<img src=""data:image/png;base64,[HERE]"" alt=""Embedded Image"">



 



 



 



 


 



 



 



 



 


(replace [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):

 




 



 



 



 


 



 



 



 



 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">



 



 



 



 


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"">here</a>.</p>



 



 



 



 


</object>



 



 



 



 


 



 



 



 



 


(replace BOTH instances of [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for your valuable suggestions. Please can we have someone from the technical team connect with us and perform the below mentioned configurations.

 

We don’t need any approvals for this we can easily configure and test the same.

 

Please arrange for a session.

 

Thanks and Regards,

 

Praveen V Huilgol

Praveen,

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:




 



 


 



 


<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):
 




 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">



 



 


 



 


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>



 



 


 



 


</object>



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)



This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Ilya Kotov

Hi Ilya,

 

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

 

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

I suggest hosting these images on a separate, inter-company available server (e.g. Windows NFS) and using a new hard link in your templates. That would be much more easy to manage from your side and will also allow you to control who can see the images.
The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Hi Ilya,

 

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users. 

 

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

 

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

 

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

 

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well. 

 

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Yes, it do not have Internet connection. U the email will be sent internally and that is accessible.

 

Emails are reaching to end users box, but only the images are not loading.

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

 

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

 

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

 

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

Hi Ilya,

 

Sorry for the delay. We need your support on this. As we discussed internally, we want PDF method to be configured and our team wants to connect with you and do it.

 

Since it is production, we cannot do any changes on the current setup without Vendor help.

 

Please check your calendar for a call and let us know. We will be joining the same.

 

Thanks and Regards,

 

Praveen V Huilgol

Praveen,

On this meeting we ensured that the suggested solution works, the image file now embedded directly into the template. You've requested some time to test it on your end. I'll re-attach the code and explanations below just in case:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:



<img src=""data:image/png;base64,[HERE]"" alt=""Embedded Image"">


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


(replace [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):

 



 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">


 


 


 


 


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"">here</a>.</p>


 


 


 


 


</object>


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


(replace BOTH instances of [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for your valuable suggestions. Please can we have someone from the technical team connect with us and perform the below mentioned configurations.

 

We don’t need any approvals for this we can easily configure and test the same.

 

Please arrange for a session.

Praveen,

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:



 


 


 


 


<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):
 



 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">


 


 


 


 


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>


 


 


 


 


</object>


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)



This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Hi Ilya,

 

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

 

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

I suggest hosting these images on a separate, inter-company available server (e.g. Windows NFS) and using a new hard link in your templates. That would be much more easy to manage from your side and will also allow you to control who can see the images.
The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Hi Ilya,

 

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users. 

 

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

 

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

 

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

 

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well. 

 

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

 

Thanks and Regards,

The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

 

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

 

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

 

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

Praveen,

On this meeting I've showed you how to encode a PDF file using Base64 string. Resulting code allowed to view and download PDF from any HTML (including email templates) page.

Please test this and see if this solution works.

Hi Ilya,

 

Sorry for the delay. We need your support on this. As we discussed internally, we want PDF method to be configured and our team wants to connect with you and do it.

 

Since it is production, we cannot do any changes on the current setup without Vendor help.

 

Please check your calendar for a call and let us know. We will be joining the same.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

On this meeting we ensured that the suggested solution works, the image file now embedded directly into the template. You've requested some time to test it on your end. I'll re-attach the code and explanations below just in case:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:



<img src=""data:image/png;base64,[HERE]"" alt=""Embedded Image"">



 



 



 



 


 



 



 



 



 


(replace [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):

 




 



 



 



 


 



 



 



 



 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">



 



 



 



 


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,[HERE]"">here</a>.</p>



 



 



 



 


</object>



 



 



 



 


 



 



 



 



 


(replace BOTH instances of [HERE] including the square brackets with your resulting Base64 string)

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for your valuable suggestions. Please can we have someone from the technical team connect with us and perform the below mentioned configurations.

 

We don’t need any approvals for this we can easily configure and test the same.

 

Please arrange for a session.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

We checked and there's still a Feature Request from you on this specific feature pending. While that is going on I, personally, recommend one more option, Base64 encoding, to directly insert small files into your template.

This can be done this way:

1) Navigate onto this site and encode all your images (or a single PDF) into Base64 string.

https://www.base64encode.org/

You'll need this option: Encode files to Base64 format

2) In your email template you will have to create a specific HTML tag to use that data:

For images:




 



 


 



 


<img src=""data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA..."" alt=""Embedded Image"">



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


(replace iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA... with your resulting Base64 string)



For files (PDF):
 




 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


<object data=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."" type=""application/pdf"" width=""600"" height=""400"">



 



 


 



 


    <p>Your email client does not support embedding PDFs. You can download the file <a href=""data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o..."">here</a>.</p>



 



 


 



 


</object>



 



 


 



 


 



 



 


 



 


(replace BOTH instances of JVBERi0xLjQKJei0o... with your resulting Base64 string)



This is the only solution I can suggest from personal experience, aside from waiting for a Feature Request to be processed.

Hi Ilya,

 

I understand your point of hosting images on a different share path. But we are not in a position to do this as nothing is open to internet from Etihad side. Since this is locally hosted application and we have to get number of approvals from client which is nearly impossible.

 

Request you to please consider the suggestion which we gave, where these images will be attached in the email itself  in either pdf or some .doc format.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

I suggest hosting these images on a separate, inter-company available server (e.g. Windows NFS) and using a new hard link in your templates. That would be much more easy to manage from your side and will also allow you to control who can see the images.
The ease of management, scalability, access control and navigation outperforms hard-attached images.

Hi Ilya,

 

Since the Stealth Audit server is in separate network segment, we cannot provide access to all users. 

 

What we want is to attach these images to the email which we send from the tool to end users rather than a link. Please work on that and provide the solution.

 

Waiting for the reply.

Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Hi Ilya,

 

Any accessible network share we cannot use for Stealth audit purpose.

 

The HTML file needs to be modified for that as well. 

 

I understand your suggestion, but if you can connect for 30 min you will get an idea rather than sending emails between us.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen,

Before we do that, can you please access the attached image's link from the server where you can't see it?
The other idea I can suggest doing is to host these images you're trying to send out on an accessible Network Share, and using image links with IP/FQDN in your emails. Have you tried those?

Best wishes,

Ilya,

 

Yes, it do not have Internet connection. U the email will be sent internally and that is accessible.

 

Emails are reaching to end users box, but only the images are not loading. 

 

Let’s catch up once and we will show you the exact issue.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen, Does that imply that the server that sends out the emails with images does not have access to the internet? Best wishes, Ilya Kotov Technical Support Engineer 1-949-407-5125 x7099 ____________________ _________ Cybersecurity That Works

Praveen, We can surely meet but before that I'd like to see the debug logs. Steps to take: 1) Navigate here: https: //helpcenter. netwrix. com/bundle/AIC_11. 6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Diagnostics. htm 2) Enable



 


Praveen,

We can surely meet but before that I'd like to see the debug logs. Steps to take:

1) Navigate here: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_11.6/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/Diagnostics.htm
2) Enable Debug logging
3) Preform the sendout of the email
4) Collect the logs and attach them

I've also noticed you had a ticket regarding 'Change in configuration for Auto emails'. Is that connected to this case?

Hi Ilya,

 

Thanks for the response. We are facing this issue from last 3 months where the users are not able to see the images in email draft ( Images which explains how to perform Access Review for Sensitive folders).

 

I have answered your query below in Green bold alphabets.

 

Please note that it is not collection job or any report issue. It is email configured in AIC for sending emails to end users from tool.

 

Request you to please arrange a call probably on Monday so that we can explain in detail and show you as well.

 

Thanks and Regards,
