Is there any work planned to appropriately handle SA password with normal special characters? If there is work separate from this escalation, I'm happy to close.","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2024-09-25T19:59:02.000Z","2024-09-25T19:59:02.000Z","false","false"

@Salesforce @Helen Randall - Hey Tay, 

My understanding is that the issue was not related to not handling special characters in passwords but rather something to do with how KeePass was generating the password, and that entering a special character into the pw manually before copying it over allowed it to work. We're not aware of any specific limitations around passwords with special characters so I think this can close.
