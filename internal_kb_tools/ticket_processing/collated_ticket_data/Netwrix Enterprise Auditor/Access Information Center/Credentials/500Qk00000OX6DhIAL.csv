Had a meeting with customer. 
We checked the logs for AIC - saw that they user account we were logging in with had a ""Request Access"" role. 
But there were no errors related to SQL connection. 

As such, tried logging in with built-in admin( login:admin pass:sb). 
admin was not logged in before so we got prompted to set admin password. 

After logging in with built-in admin customer confirmed that AIC is working. 

Customer asked to send a couple of articles to him: how to set up user roles and how to secure aic.

Customer confirmed that ticket can be closed.","","We checked the logs for AIC - saw that the user account we were logging in with had a ""Request Access"" role.

As such, we tried logging in with built-in admin.
Built-in admin was not logged in before so we got prompted to set admin password anew.

After logging in with built-in admin we confirmed that AIC is working.

As was discussed, I am sending you additional materials from our helpcenter that will guide you on how to configure different roles for users and how to secure access to AIC using SSL:
