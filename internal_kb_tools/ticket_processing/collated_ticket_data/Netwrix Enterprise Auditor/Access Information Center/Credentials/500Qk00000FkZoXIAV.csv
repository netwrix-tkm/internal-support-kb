"500Qk00000FkZoXIAV","00421046","Support Ticket","POC: AIC installer not creating proper connection string format","Hey team, ran into an issue during a PoC install where the AIC cannot connect post-installation.

- Fresh install (11.6.0.23) however AIC at logon page indicates inability to connect to DB.  
- Login with 'admin/sb' creds fails.
- Installer ran with no issue.  That includes the entry of the DB/account creds and their validation.
- Using SQL auth
- NEA installed on same box, same db & creds without issue.
- log indicates: ""Format of the initialization string does not conform to specification starting at index 92.""  (full error below)
- Did a complete wipe of AIC components and used a new download to rule out file corruption.  Made sure download was unblocked.

Ran this through the SWAT team, initial response is possible corruption in the config file, but no response since then.  Opening ticket as this issue is time sensitive due to being a POC.  (Link to original discussion but all details included here: https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/19:2f33cf4c06364f4c8644adce095eb161@thread.tacv2/1725991306866?tenantId=097499ff-179d-4959-ab02-86d364125bfc&groupId=72f83b71-3180-482b-b588-9595342c5a50&parentMessageId=1725991306866&teamName=SWAT%20Teams%3A%20Product%20Discussions%2C%20PM%20Q%26A%2C%20Feedback&channelName=StealthAUDIT%20Core&createdTime=1725991306866)

We could use R&D's help here with figuring out what went wrong.  The AIC is a bit of a black box here, the installer handles that string creation and after that it's encrypted..  The config file looks formatted well otherwise.  So far I am unable to reproduce the issue in my lab.
 
Config file for the customer attached.  The error pasted below is the entirety of the log file from a fresh install.

We're not aware of any specific limitations around passwords with special characters so I think this can close.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Tay Caliguiri","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","Access Information Center","Credentials","11.6","","23.9","Closed - Resolved","Apex Tool Group","Michael Nanos","2024-09-13T20:17:31.000Z","2024-10-07T17:27:03.000Z"
