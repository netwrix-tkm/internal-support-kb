Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
My name is Artem, I will be assisting you with this ticket.

Thank you for providing details for the issue. I just have a couple of questions which should help us streamline troubleshooting process and speed up issue resolution:


	Currently you are unable to see any information after logging in to AIC. Correct?
	This issue happened after upgrade?
	May I ask you to check current database connection settings in AIC? To do this, open Access Information Center web page, login with account that has admin privileges > select ""Configure Console"" > then click on Database. Please, take screenshot of this information and attach to the ticket. 
	Which database is currently configured in Netwrix (Enterprise Auditor) Access Analyzer? To check this open Enterprise Auditor console, then select ""Settings""> ""Storage"" > check the currently selected storage profile. Please, take screenshot of this information and attach screenshot to the ticket.
	To continue, the screenshot you shared appears to be an AIC after logging in with a user account that does not have administrator permissions. May I ask you, do you have role based access configured for AIC? Do you have multiple user accounts in the ""Configure Console"" > ""Console Access""?
	Please, try logging in to AIC using built-in admin account. Do you still see no information there after that?


I am looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Artem Naskal
