Artem Naskal 

Had a meeting with customer. 
We checked the logs for AIC - saw that they user account we were logging in with had a ""Request Access"" role. 
But there were no errors related to SQL connection. 

As such, tried logging in with built-in admin( login:admin pass:sb). 
admin was not logged in before so we got prompted to set admin password. 

After logging in with built-in admin customer confirmed that AIC is working. 

Customer asked to send a couple of articles to him: how to set up user roles and how to secure aic. 

How to set up user roles:

https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/AIC_12.0/page/Content/Access/InformationCenter/Admin/Configuration/ConsoleAccess.htm

What different user roles provide:

How to secure AIC:

Customer confirmed that ticket can be closed.","","","","005Qk000002b4gDIAQ","2025-05-02T09:43:13.000Z"
