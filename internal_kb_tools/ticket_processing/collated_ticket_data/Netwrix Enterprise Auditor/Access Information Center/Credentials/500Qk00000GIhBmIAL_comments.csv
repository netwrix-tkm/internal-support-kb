Both of these if the same account that is connecting to AD for listing/scanning Object is used as the Services account the Related Services will need to be updated as well

  /*-- if needed enable AIC built-in Admin in SQL

UPDATE SA_AIC_Authentication
SET IsEnabled = 1
WHERE TrusteeSID = 'X-1-1-0'

*/
