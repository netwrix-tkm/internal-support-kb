Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.","","","","0054u000007ow49AAA","2024-10-30T12:56:21.000Z"

On this meeting we ensured that the suggested solution works, the image file now embedded directly into the template.
Base64 encoding directly into the email template works.","","","","0054u000007ow49AAA","2024-11-18T11:31:46.000Z"
