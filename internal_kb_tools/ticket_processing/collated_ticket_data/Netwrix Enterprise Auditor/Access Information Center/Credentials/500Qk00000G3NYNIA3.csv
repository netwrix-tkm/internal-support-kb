I am unable to access the webportal to perform a user group audit.  It is showing a 503 error any idea on what can be done","","","","Issue
AIC portal is not loading properly, presenting a 503 error upon trying to access it.

Cause
The service account associated with NEA was updated with a new password but the relevant IIS settings were accidentally overlooked and not updated.
