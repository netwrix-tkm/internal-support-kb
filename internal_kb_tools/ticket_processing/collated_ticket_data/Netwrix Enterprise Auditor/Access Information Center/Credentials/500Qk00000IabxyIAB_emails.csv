Per our call today we noted that the current version of Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) post upgrading

Domain Prefix Requirement: Due to the change from IIS to a new web server, users will now need to include their domain prefix (e.g., US.East) before their username when logging in.

Previous Version vs. New Version: In the previous version with IIS, the default domain was assumed. This is no longer the case in the new version.

Alternative Solutions: Looked at the possibility of switching the account in the Active Directory configuration to eliminate the need for the domain prefix. Unfortunately, this wouldn't work due to trust relationships between domains.

Requiring the domain prefix initially will cause some inconvenience for users accustomed to the previous behavior, it ultimately creates a more uniform and consistent login experience across all domains.

This will be a slight adjustment for your users, but adding the domain prefix will resolve any login issues they encounter.

Thank You for the update, I will close out this ticket as noted.

We have 30days to reopen once the closure email is received.

To reopen we can just reply to that email to bring the case back into my queue.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. 

Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link.

Have a great week and Holiday.

Again, thank You for your time.

Connie,

Thank You for the update.

I am checking with R&D being that 11.6 AIC uses a new Web engine and I am wondering if that was functionality via the older IIS configuration(s)
 
I will get an update out as soon as possible.

Again, thank You for your time.

What is the impact of the issue on your business? 

Users contact help desk or make tickets claiming not to be able to login as they never had to previously specify the domain.

Who is affected by this issue? 

Users

What software is currently installed?
Could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

 

Name                              Version    InstallDate

----                              -------    -----------

Netwrix Access Information Center 11.6.0.25  20241014

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor V11.6  11.6.0.113 20241014

 

C:Program Files (x86)STEALTHbitsStealthAUDIT

 

C:Program FilesSTEALTHbitsAccess Information CenterAccessInformationCenter.Service.exe

 

We have multiple domains in the settings, we want USE to be the default domain if there is a setting that allows that to return to pre-upgrade behavior.

What do we show on the Active Directory Page?
Netwrix Access Information Center 11.6 > Administrator Overview > Configuration Interface Overview > Active Directory Page > Multiple Domains

By default, only domain users from the domain where the Enterprise Auditor Console resides can access the Web Console and the Access Information Center.
The Allow authentication from the following domains option is where access from other domains can be granted.
Any additional required domains to the default domain as a comma separated list.
    For example: NWXTECH.COM,CORP.EXAMPLE.COM

All domains provided must have a trust relationship with the domain where the Access Information Center resides.

If the Web Console is enabled for access from multiple domains, the Access Information Center should be configured to be accessible by the same domains. See the Enable Multiple

Domain Access topic of the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor Documentation for additional information.

NOTE: All domains enabled to access the Access Information Center must also have data collected by the .Active Directory Inventory solution of Enterprise Auditor.
