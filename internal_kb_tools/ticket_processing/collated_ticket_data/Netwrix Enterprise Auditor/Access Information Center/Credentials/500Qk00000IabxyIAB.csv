"500Qk00000IabxyIAB","00427747","Support Ticket","Default domain for AIC","In our environment, we have multiple domains and in the previous 11.5 version we seemed to have our USE domain as the default.

Since upgrade to 11.6, that doesn't seem to be the case nor am I able to find anywhere to set the default domain. The users on our USE domain have gotten accustomed to not needing to use their domain prefix to login, so would like to set it, if it is possible.","","What is the impact of the issue on your business? 

Users contact help desk or make tickets claiming not to be able to login as they never had to previously specify the domain.

Who is affected by this issue? 

Users","","Per our call today we noted that the current version of Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC) post upgrading

Domain Prefix Requirement: Due to the change from IIS to a new web server, users will now need to include their domain prefix (e.g., US.East) before their username when logging in.

Previous Version vs. New Version: In the previous version with IIS, the default domain was assumed. This is no longer the case in the new version.

Alternative Solutions: Looked at the possibility of switching the account in the Active Directory configuration to eliminate the need for the domain prefix. Unfortunately, this wouldn't work due to trust relationships between domains.

Requiring the domain prefix initially will cause some inconvenience for users accustomed to the previous behavior, it ultimately creates a more uniform and consistent login experience across all domains.

This will be a slight adjustment for your users, but adding the domain prefix will resolve any login issues they encounter.","Netwrix account issues","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","Access Information Center","Credentials","11.6","25","4.8","Closed - Resolved","W.
