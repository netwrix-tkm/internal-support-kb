"500Qk00000GIhBmIAL","00422225","Support Ticket","Access Information Center | Cannot Connect To AD","Good morning!

I'm getting an error when trying to get into AIC. Yesterday it was saying that it couldn't connect to AD, today it just says ""An unknown error has occurred while logging in"".

I updated the passwords for 2 of the service accounts last week, which naturally times up well with AIC breaking lol. I haven't done a password update before (or anything really, previous admin left, I've had access for like 3 months lol) but I just read the KB article that popped up while typing this (below) and it mentions reinstalling AIC.

Would that be applicable for any/every password update? I don't know what the config is like for the SQL DB (SSO, ownership workflow). We have a SQL server and an app server, but I'm assuming I'd need to reinstall it on the app server.

Any clarification/assistance would be greatly appreciated!

Both of these if the same account that is connecting to AD for listing/scanning Object is used as the Services account the Related Services will need to be updated as well

Used the following to re-enable the AIC Built in Admin account.

  --SELECT * FROM [dbo].[SA_AIC_Authentication] 

  --SELECT * FROM [dbo].[SA_AIC_ActiveDirectoryPrincipals]

  /*-- if needed enable AIC built-in Admin in SQL

---  in the *StealthAUDIT ComplianceWeb.config clear the value in <add key=""AuthBuiltinAdminPassword"" value="""" />  

UPDATE SA_AIC_Authentication
SET IsEnabled = 1

*/

With that we were able to update the AD connection account then confirm the Admin Group was working as expected.
I will close out this ticket as noted.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix server","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","Access Information Center","Credentials","11.6","58","4.1","Closed - Resolved","Alpine Bank","Luke Brackin","2024-09-26T16:08:51.000Z","2024-09-30T17:26:52.000Z"
