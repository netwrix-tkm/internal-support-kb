Since upgrade to 11.6, that doesn't seem to be the case nor am I able to find anywhere to set the default domain. The users on our USE domain have gotten accustomed to not needing to use their domain prefix to login, so would like to set it, if it is possible.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-20T22:21:49.000Z"

Users contact help desk or make tickets claiming not to be able to login as they never had to previously specify the domain.
