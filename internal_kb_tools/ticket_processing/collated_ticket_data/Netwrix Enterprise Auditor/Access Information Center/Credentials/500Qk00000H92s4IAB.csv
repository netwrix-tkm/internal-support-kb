of late we are facing issues with Images being loaded on the end user mailbox. We need this to be checked end to end and provide an alternative solution at the earliest. Please schedule a call on priority basis.

Thanks and Regards,

Praveen V.Huilgol","Make your environment completely unavailable to internet and refuse to host images on any server that is available without login.","Praveen,

Thank you for your time today.

On this meeting we've reviewed your environment and the consensus is as follows:

1) The images are hosted on the same server where AIC resides
2) The images are not accessible to unauthenticated users (meaning, that to view these images, they first need to log onto the AIC server)
3) Once logged onto the AIC server images become visible everywhere

This is a common issue with servers hosting our software that do not have access to the internet. Intranet access needs to be configured in such a way, that the images in question are accessible by EVERY USER even if they are not authenticated.

Your Security Team should be able to make necessary changes, and you have multiple scenarios:

1) Allow Read access to the image files for any user, which will allow recipients to view images

2) Host the image files on a server with Internet access and make them publicly available (a discoverable network share).
Please note that this will also require you to change links (paths) in your email templates ^

After consulting with your Security Team, pick one scenario and ensure the access. 

How to test:
The resulting image link should open in any browser on client's device without the need to log in.

On this meeting we ensured that the suggested solution works, the image file now embedded directly into the template.
Base64 encoding directly into the email template works.","Waiting for the customer to actually finally do what's being told in span of 4 tickets on this point.

Waiting for the client to test the solution.","We implemented a roundabout solution for your specific environment by introducing Base64 encoded images/files directly into the template. This way they are attached to the email directly, without any third-party servers and do no require auth/login to be viewed.

!!!Please do not implement this solution, as this is only a temporary fix for the client before their multiple feature requests are processed!!!","Guidance","Ilya Kotov","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","Access Information Center","Credentials","11.5","","53.2","Closed - Resolved","IBM - Etihad Airways","Praveen Huilgol","2024-10-17T09:33:28.000Z","2024-12-09T13:33:30.000Z"
