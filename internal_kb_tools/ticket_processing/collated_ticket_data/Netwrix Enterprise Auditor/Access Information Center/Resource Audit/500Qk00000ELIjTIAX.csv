I am working though remediating some open shares and I am utilising the Resource Audit feature that I can access through the AIC.

When I look at the Activity Statistics or the Activity Details I can see the name or the account that is accessing the data.  And when I hover my mouse over the name I see the DomainSAMAccountName.

Is there a way to change the view to see DomainSAMAccountName instead of the user name?

In an organisation of our size there maybe multiple accounts with the same user name but the SAMAccountName is unique.

Regards","","","","Customer wanted to see SAMAccountName in the view.
