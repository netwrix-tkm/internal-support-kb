Step 1: Upgrade the Netwrix Enterprise Auditor to version 12.0.0.1051.  
Step 2: Navigate to the Access Information Center within the Resource Audit feature.  
Step 3: Attempt to manually add individuals to resource groups.  
Step 4: Observe that the option to manually add people to resource groups is no longer available.","1) Back in AIC 11.6.0.37 under Home > ""Resource Ownership"" (with the correct permissions) there was a ""Change Access"" button with which one could ""Change Resource Access"" (Add, Remove, Change resource access).

2) Also in AIC 11.6.0.37, on the ""Change Resource Access"" popup the end user could ""SET [a] DATE"" for temporary access that would expire on that date.  This temporary access functionality seems to be missing in AIC 12.0.0.1051.

3) And there was a column on the Home > Access Requests screen called ""Expired"" which would show the ""Access will expire <DATE>"" upon mouseover.
