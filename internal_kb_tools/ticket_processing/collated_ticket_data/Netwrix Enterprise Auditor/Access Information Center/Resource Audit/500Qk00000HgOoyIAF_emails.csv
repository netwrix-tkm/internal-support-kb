Hi Ian

Yes, the USEhwang would be in use.wlgore.com (they obviously exist because they were able to login to AIC to submit the request).

They were created after the upgrade (on 10/14):
UserPrincipalName  : hwang@wlgore.com<mailto:hwang@wlgore.com>
WhenCreated        : 10/27/2024 2:20:23 PM

I don’t see them under ADInventory_UserView, probably because the ADScan is not actually scanning any hosts since the upgrade as seen in the last screenshot.

Hi Connie,

Can you confirm for me that these missing users should be able to be located, or at one point were located in one of the below domains.

""use.wlgore.com,usw.wlgore.com,ap.wlgore.com,eu.wlgore.com,wlgore.com""

We did not change permissions on that service account as the groups it was affecting was an edge case and the affected user had been directed to use ADUC.
(AIC in our environment is primarily for shares, internally it is called “Folder Access Manager”)

So this isn't just affecting deleted users then.
Just to confirm, has the service account being used by AIC been updated to fix the permissions issues we saw previously? I just want to rule out any sort of effect that the permissions might have been having on this.

We seem to also be having an issue that affects active users in AD.
USEhwang is active in AD, but it’s not able to find the SID?
From AD:
SamAccountName    : hwang
SID               : S-1-5-21-3542245194-2364831464-1968421150-125114

Hello Connie,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From the logs you provided it looks like a null from a deleted user.
Can you provide the version of the AIC console you are using so I can look into this for you?

Hi Ian

 

Yes, the USEhwang would be in use.wlgore.com (they obviously exist because they were able to login to AIC to submit the request).

 

They were created after the upgrade (on 10/14):

UserPrincipalName  : hwang@wlgore.com

WhenCreated        : 10/27/2024 2:20:23 PM

 

I don’t see them under ADInventory_UserView, probably because the ADScan is not actually scanning any hosts since the upgrade as seen in the last screenshot.

Hi Connie,

Can you confirm for me that these missing users should be able to be located, or at one point were located in one of the below domains.

""use.wlgore.com,usw.wlgore.com,ap.wlgore.com,eu.wlgore.com,wlgore.com""

We did not change permissions on that service account as the groups it was affecting was an edge case and the affected user had been directed to use ADUC.

(AIC in our environment is primarily for shares, internally it is called “Folder Access Manager”)

So this isn't just affecting deleted users then.
Just to confirm, has the service account being used by AIC been updated to fix the permissions issues we saw previously? I just want to rule out any sort of effect that the permissions might have been having on this.

Thank you,

We seem to also be having an issue that affects active users in AD.

USEhwang is active in AD, but it’s not able to find the SID?

From AD:

SamAccountName    : hwang

SID               : S-1-5-21-3542245194-2364831464-1968421150-125114

Hello Connie,

My name is Ian and I will be assisting you with your case.

From the logs you provided it looks like a null from a deleted user.
Can you provide the version of the AIC console you are using so I can look into this for you?



Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the host list that was being used by the ADI scan as it appears ADI hasn't scanned successfully in some time.

The list is being generated by a custom script and was failing to update. We then created a new version of the job and ran it to see if it would populate the table as expected.
Our next steps are:

You will:
Monitor the ADI scan job to verify it runs succesfully.
If it does, check the AIC logs to verify that the errors have stopped.

Hi Ian

The ADI scan seems to be working appropriately now and we can see AD users created after the upgrade in AIC now.

I think we’re now just back to the original issue of what appear to be expiring access requests where the user likely separated from the company before the expiration date.

Hi Ian

The ADI scan seems to be working appropriately now and we can see AD users created after the upgrade in AIC now.

I think we’re now just back to the original issue of what appear to be expiring access requests where the user likely separated from the company before the expiration date.

Hello Connie,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the host list that was being used by the ADI scan as it appears ADI hasn't scanned successfully in some time.

The list is being generated by a custom script and was failing to update. We then created a new version of the job and ran it to see if it would populate the table as expected.
Our next steps are:

You will:
Monitor the ADI scan job to verify it runs succesfully.
If it does, check the AIC logs to verify that the errors have stopped.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience




Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

No I doubt it, these expiring requests are rather old dates. They have would have had to existed for the initial request to have been completed in the first place.

Expiring request #98380

Expired on: 2/1/2024 5:00:00 AM

Expiring request #95735

Expired on: 12/31/2023 12:00:00 AM

Expiring request #95736

Expired on: 12/31/2023 12:00:00 AM



I wasn’t sure if these events were new or not with the upgrade, but I can confidently confirm these are a result of the upgrade.


I have a logs export from before the upgrade and I have several days of events and these expiring requests aren’t in there.
(The problem I face with these events in the logs is that the aic.log rotates out too quickly and I can only see about the past 3 hours. Makes it difficult to troubleshoot when users may not report an issue until hours or days later.)

For these users that you say are already gone, where they newer accounts as well that may have been missed originally from the ADI scans while it was broken?

Hello Connie,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the host list that was being used by the ADI scan as it appears ADI hasn't scanned successfully in some time.

The list is being generated by a custom script and was failing to update. We then created a new version of the job and ran it to see if it would populate the table as expected.
Our next steps are:

You will:
Monitor the ADI scan job to verify it runs succesfully.
If it does, check the AIC logs to verify that the errors have stopped.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience




Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Connie,

I think we have a workaround that we can use to try and fix this.
We will need access to the SQL database to make some modifications.

Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting to look into this.

No I doubt it, these expiring requests are rather old dates. They have would have had to existed for the initial request to have been completed in the first place.

Expiring request #98380

Expired on: 2/1/2024 5:00:00 AM

Expiring request #95735

Expired on: 12/31/2023 12:00:00 AM

Expiring request #95736

Expired on: 12/31/2023 12:00:00 AM

 

I wasn’t sure if these events were new or not with the upgrade, but I can confidently confirm these are a result of the upgrade.

 

I have a logs export from before the upgrade and I have several days of events and these expiring requests aren’t in there.

(The problem I face with these events in the logs is that the aic.log rotates out too quickly and I can only see about the past 3 hours. Makes it difficult to troubleshoot when users may not report an issue until hours or days later.)

Hi Connie,

We are still looking into this, I am trying to reproduce internally.
For these users that you say are already gone, where they newer accounts as well that may have been missed originally from the ADI scans while it was broken?

Hi Ian

 

The ADI scan seems to be working appropriately now and we can see AD users created after the upgrade in AIC now.

 

I think we’re now just back to the original issue of what appear to be expiring access requests where the user likely separated from the company before the expiration date.

Thank you for your time and patience on this issue and I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved for you. 
The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Issue:
Logs are rotating quickly due to AIC trying to remove permissions from users that it cannot find a domain for.

2024-10-30 10:14:54 -- Error -- Exception:
2024-10-30 10:14:54 -- Error -- Message: Unable to find domain for member: S-1-5-21-3542245194-2364831464-1968421150-114106
2024-10-30 10:14:54 -- Error -- Type: System.InvalidOperationException
2024-10-30 10:14:54 -- Error -- StackTrace:
at AccessInformationCenter.Model.Membership.ActiveDirectoryMembership.Execute(StorageDataContext dc, String domainName, MembershipRequest request)
at AccessInformationCenter.Model.Membership.MembershipAction.Execute(StorageDataContext dc, String feature, String invokerName, String invokerSid, IEnumerable`1 changes, Nullable`1 changeId)


Cause:
The issue is caused when a user is granted temporary permissions to a resources, but the user is deleted prior to the permission expiring. When the permission expires the AIC console keeps trying to remove the user but cannot find the information for it.

Resolution:
Set the ExpirationState to 2 in the SA_AIC_ResourceAccessRequests table for each SID encountering the problem. This will set the permission state to complete.

At this time I will be closing your ticket out for you. This case can be re-opened at any time if any related issues return. 
Please feel free to reach out to the Netwrix team if you have any additional questions or would like assistance with any issues. Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case has been closed.
You will also receive a survey link, it would help us greatly to improve our support service if you could provide any feedback that you may have regarding your experience with this case.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Connie,

I think we have a workaround that we can use to try and fix this.
We will need access to the SQL database to make some modifications.

Below is a link you can use to schedule a meeting to look into this.

No I doubt it, these expiring requests are rather old dates. They have would have had to existed for the initial request to have been completed in the first place.

Expiring request #98380

Expired on: 2/1/2024 5:00:00 AM

Expiring request #95735

Expired on: 12/31/2023 12:00:00 AM

Expiring request #95736

Expired on: 12/31/2023 12:00:00 AM

 

I wasn’t sure if these events were new or not with the upgrade, but I can confidently confirm these are a result of the upgrade.

 

I have a logs export from before the upgrade and I have several days of events and these expiring requests aren’t in there.

(The problem I face with these events in the logs is that the aic.log rotates out too quickly and I can only see about the past 3 hours. Makes it difficult to troubleshoot when users may not report an issue until hours or days later.)

Hi Connie,

We are still looking into this, I am trying to reproduce internally.
For these users that you say are already gone, where they newer accounts as well that may have been missed originally from the ADI scans while it was broken?

Thank you,

Hi Ian

 

The ADI scan seems to be working appropriately now and we can see AD users created after the upgrade in AIC now.

 

I think we’re now just back to the original issue of what appear to be expiring access requests where the user likely separated from the company before the expiration date.

Hello Connie,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the host list that was being used by the ADI scan as it appears ADI hasn't scanned successfully in some time.

The list is being generated by a custom script and was failing to update. We then created a new version of the job and ran it to see if it would populate the table as expected.
Our next steps are:

You will:
Monitor the ADI scan job to verify it runs succesfully.
If it does, check the AIC logs to verify that the errors have stopped.

Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience




Thank you,
