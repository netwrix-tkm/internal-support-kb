2) Also in AIC 11.6.0.37, on the ""Change Resource Access"" popup the end user could ""SET [a] DATE"" for temporary access that would expire on that date.  This temporary access functionality seems to be missing in AIC 12.0.0.1051.

3) And there was a column on the Home > Access Requests screen called ""Expired"" which would show the ""Access will expire <DATE>"" upon mouseover.
