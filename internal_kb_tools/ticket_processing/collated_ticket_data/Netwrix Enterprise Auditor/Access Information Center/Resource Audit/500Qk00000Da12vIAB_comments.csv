@Salesforce @Helen Randall - Hey Pasan, 

Could we get the activity events log associated with those events in AIC from this customer? There are some common issues with how Isilon reports activity events and getting the activity logs would help us confirm the issue.

@Michael Burrofato @Sanjay Meghani @Salesforce @Helen Randall - 

Dev reviewed this, what the partner reproduced is not the same issue that TSMC is seeing. What the partner reproduced is related to the fact that the date range query in AIC queries all the events that fall into that range in GMT format, but then displays those events with the local timezone set on the AIC console, so it's not necessarily an issue that some events may fall slightly outside of the date range depending on the timezone of the AIC console. 

However, TSMC seems to be seeing an issue where activity events are multiple days past the applied filter, which would be a different. In order to diagnose that issue we'd really need the activity logs from TSMC containing the activity events from the date range in question. There's not really anything we can investigate without those logs. 

We'd also like to point out that it looks like TSMC is still on v11.0, which is no longer supported as of April 2024. So even if we were to identify a bug here we wouldn't be able to deliver a fix for 11.0.

@Salesforce @Helen Randall - Hey Pasan, 

The event in AIC is not showing in GMT timezone as far as we can tell. In the screenshot we got from TSMC (""Data not showing correctly in AIC.png"") the date range selected is 8/1/2024-8/2/2024 using the local timezone (GMT+8), i uploaded a screenshot illustrating that the date range is using the local timezone (see ""GMT plus 8.png"" attached in SP). However, the activity events shown in the screenshot are showing an access time of 8/5/2024 which should also be using local timezone (GMT+8). So the issue is that we're seeing dates in local timezone outside of the selected date range, not that the events are shown in GMT. That's why we need TSMC's activity logs from NAM showing the actual full timestamp of the events, so we can determine when the events actually occurred and whether there's a date translation issue on the NAM side or AIC or somewhere else. 


I also want to reiterate that even if we do find a bug here we won't be able to deliver a fix for it in 11.0.

Unfortunately, partner cannot get activity logs from TSMC as they will not share those details because those contain their sensitive data.
Partner was able to reproduce the same in their lab environment and shared the activity events logs. Please refer to log file log_20240830 in SP. Related AIC events you can see in the screenshot ""µê¬σ£û 2024-08-30 15.01.09"".

One another thing we noticed was, when we change the local server time to UTC on the AIC installed server it shows correct data in AIC. Not sure how relevant this would be.

Partner understands that customer is in older version. They want us to confirm if this is going to fix if they upgrade to newer version or a hotfix is needed. Even if it is a hotfix, I understand that customer will need to update to a version that supports which I can communicate to them.","0054u000007p5dwAAA","2024-08-30T07:48:52.000Z","2024-08-30T07:48:52.000Z","false","false"

@Salesforce this one remains in the backlog. Due to release work overrunning, it will be December before this is looked at.

@Salesforce @Helen Randall - we haven't been able to pull this one onto a sprint yet due to other higher priority items. This is near the top of the backlog and i anticipate being able to pull this onto the sprint starting 1/8/25.

@Salesforce @Ethan Israel @Helen Randall A fix was made and will be available in next weeks CU (01/31/2024). Unfortunately wasn't finished in time to make the cut for this week.

We can post it sooner if needed.

This fix is available in AIC build 11.6.0.35. There are no plans to merge this fix down to 11.5
