I hope you are doing well.

Due to the enhancements and critical issues the R&D team has been addressing over the past few months, this has been delayed.

I'm expecting to get a response from them late December and if I hear back from them earlier than that, I'll get back to you.

Hi Pasan,

 

Okay.We will provide the log for sure.

Anyway,this issue was reproduced in our lab as well,the thing is the display of activities on AIC was all correctly when the DEFEND’s time zone came to GMT.

Unfortunately,when the time zone was setup as GMT+8,the result became wrong.so I think we should have a call tomorrow or Friday to take a look at this.

Are you available for a session tomorrow or Friday ?

Are you sure you could give us the root cause if we really give the log to RD?

HI Pasan,

 

if you mentioned is correct,that mean losing less 8 hours activities by AIC when using GMT as timezone as well as AIC can’t correctly translate the correct time zone

Hi Jimmy,

I asked the question about GMT time zone question and below is the response from R&D.

The activity events shown in the screenshot (Please see the attached) are showing an access time of 8/5/2024 which should also be using local time zone (GMT+8). So, the issue is that we're seeing dates in local time zone outside of the selected date range, not that the events are shown in GMT.

That's why we need TSMC's activity logs from NAM showing the actual full timestamp of the events, so we can determine when the events actually occurred and whether there's a date translation issue on the NAM side or AIC or somewhere else. 

Can you kindly provide NAM logs that are related to these events so R&D team can investigate?

Hi Pasan,

 

The thing isn’t  the activity logs from TSMC containing the activity events from the date range,it’s was caused by GMT,the wrong time zone of AIC.

 

Could you recommend a way to modify the time zone to GMT+8 like web.conf in AIC?

However,this might be the work run TSMC can accepted.

Hi Pasan,

 

First of all,the logs uploaded are all you guys requested, we have already done and provided those as well.

On the other hand,This’s so clear TSMC can’t doing an investigation  by  AIC since it’s using GMT as a default time zone.

 

So just tell TSMC why AIC is using GMT as a default time zone.

 

Sincerely,

Jimmy

Hi Pasan,

 

The true thing is AIC use GMT as default time zone, however, it don’t make sense for TSMC when using GMT as a base to do an investigation by AIC 

Anyway, not only version 11.0 ,but we also see this issue in our lab StealthAUDIT 11.5 as well and think this’s common issue of AIC

Besides ,I really don’t know and wonder why you guys or RD can’t reproduced this issue and check it out on your side.

 

At this stage,the only thing you and R&D should do is letting TSMC know why the time zone of AIC is GMT,not GMT+8.

 

Please noticed and reply for this question and looking forward to hearing from you.

 

After that,when this issue can be sorted it out.That all.

 

@georges.chahwan@netwrix.com

 

Could you assist in replying this question above,please?

Jimmy

	Caution! This message was sent from outside your organization.

Hi Jimmy,

R&D reviewed the logs shared and what Cooper reproduced is not the same issue that TSMC is seeing. What Cooper reproduced is related to the fact that the date range query in AIC queries all the events that fall into that range in GMT format, but then displays those events with the local timezone set on the AIC console, so it's not necessarily an issue that some events may fall slightly outside of the date range depending on the timezone of the AIC console. 

However, TSMC seems to be seeing an issue where activity events are multiple days past the applied filter, which would be a different. 
In order to diagnose that issue they really need the activity logs from TSMC containing the activity events from the date range in question. There's not really anything we can investigate without those logs. 

They would also like to point out that it looks like TSMC is still on v11.0, which is no longer supported as of April 2024. So even if they were to identify a bug here, they wouldn't be able to deliver a fix for v11.0. 

Can you please provide the logs as soon as possible from the customer environment so I can get R&D team to review and provide response?

Hi Cooper,

If you cannot get the requested logs from the customer environment, can you share the logs in your lab as you are seeing the same issue in your lab.

I'm also getting clarification on why AIC is using GMT+0 time zone.

Hi Pasan,

 

My lab also has the same issue.

Condition: Search date range is 7/27

1.       The date range retrieved by AIC is 7/27, but the result shows 7/28, which is consistent with the activity log of NAM retrieval date range 7/28.

[Inline image name : image011.png]

2.       The NAM search date range 7/27 has activity logs
