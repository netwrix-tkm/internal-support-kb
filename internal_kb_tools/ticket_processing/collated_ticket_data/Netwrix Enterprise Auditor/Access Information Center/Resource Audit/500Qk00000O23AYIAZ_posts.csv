Opened new ticket for AIC issue. The issue appears to be old info in the T2 database preventing server 01 from running bulk import, so no new data exists for AIC to check which leads to the old scan date being shown.

---------------
Zoom meeting on 04/23:
client running SA 11.5.0.210
resolved the issue preventing the FSAA bulk import for SVOC-FS01 from completing. The issue seemed to be a sequencing issue were SVOC-FS01 was no longer on the FSAA_Hosts table but still had left over data (Tier2s). The bulk import job was saw the old data and was trying to upload the leftover data before adding SVOC-FS01 back to the host list.

We resolved the issue by deleting/renaming the old T2 data for SVOC-FS01 then running the scan again.","","","","0054u000007oss5AAA","2025-04-23T19:59:55.000Z"
