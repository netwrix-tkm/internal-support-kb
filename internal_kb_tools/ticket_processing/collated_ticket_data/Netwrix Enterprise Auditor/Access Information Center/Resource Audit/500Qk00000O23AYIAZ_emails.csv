With the import throwing an error that is most likely the cause of the AIC not updating.

You can provide us with the error or log of the Bulk Import job. I would also grab the same logs from the System Scans job.

First for the import at least lets make sure the job is in Debug and then rerun it just in case it provides more details.

Right click on the Bulk Import job and Select Properties. Then confirm the Log level is set to Debug.



If its already set to debug or if you just added it yourself. You can go to the top of the Job Pane and Click View Log.


Then save the log file wherever you need to attach it to the ticket in the portal.

It might be helpful for you to grab the log the same way from the FSAA_System_Scan as well, as that may be the source of the Import troubles.

Thanks,

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session were able to resolve the issue preventing the FSAA bulk import for SVOC-FS01 from completing. The issue seemed to be a sequencing issue were SVOC-FS01 was no longer on the FSAA_Hosts table but still had left over data (Tier2s). The bulk import job was saw the old data and was trying to upload the leftover data before adding SVOC-FS01 back to the host list.

We resolved the issue by deleting/renaming the old T2 data for SVOC-FS01 then running the scan again.

At the end of the meeting, we started the permissions scan from the schedule. It will likely take hours to finish. Please let us know when it has completed and if you see any other errors in the process. The errors we did see were about the missing security descriptors. This is common environmental issue. If you'd like to run those down, the errors should call out specific objects that should have their security descriptors reviewed/created.

Here is a brief summary of the troubleshooting steps we performed:

	checked host list being used by FSAA system scan and bulk import
	
		-SVOC-FS01 is on the list
	
	
	checked FSAA_Hosts table in SQL
	
		-SVOC-FS01 is not on that table
		
			--this is expected because they dropped the T1s for that host in a previous meeting
		
		
	
	
	No proxies being used--all scans run locally
	located and renamed T2 database folder for that host to SVOC-FS01.old0414
	configured host assignment for FSAA scan and bulk import to target only SVOC-FS01
	ran a zero-level scan from schedule
	the scan completed quickly with good data
	ran bulk import interactively
	checked FSAA_Hosts table again
	
		-confirmed SVOC-FS01 is now present on the table
	
	
	Set the scan depth back to 10 levels
	
		-will need to be set to full depth after confirming this scan completes
	
	
	Set host list assignment back to the original host list
	kicked off permissions group scan
	
		-this will likely take hours
	
	


Thank you,

Hello Casey,

It looks like the repair isn't proceeding with this host because we dropped the data for it and that did succeed.
Lets setup a meeting to take a look at its current state and get this host working again.

Hello,

 

Apologies on the delay in response. 

 

I am not seeing SVOC-FS01 as an option under maintenance despite it being correct in the BNH-WINFS Host group:

 



 

 

Here is the inherited host group:


 

 

But when I look in the maintenance, I see this:



 

Thanks!

Hello Casey,

From the logs it looks like SVOC-FS01 is still giving us trouble. I've got one more fix I'd like to try.
From your console navigate to the 1-FSAA System Scans job and expand the configuration and select queries.
From the right side pane double click on the File System Scan query.



Once the Query Properties window opens, select configure


On the Query Selection window, at the bottom select Maintenance.



From the Maintenance window select repair and hit next.



On the Repair Tool screen, select SVOC-FS01 and hit the ""Run"" button.



After the repair runs and says it completed successfully, press finish and close all open windows.
Then run the FSAA jobs again with the scan and bulk import.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hi Joshua,

The FSAA Bulk Import was successful!

However, there still seems to be an issue with the FSAC bulk import:

Hello Casey,

Thank you for meeting with me today. In our session were able to resolve the issue preventing the FSAA bulk import for SVOC-FS01 from completing. The issue seemed to be a sequencing issue were SVOC-FS01 was no longer on the FSAA_Hosts table but still had left over data (Tier2s). The bulk import job was saw the old data and was trying to upload the leftover data before adding SVOC-FS01 back to the host list.

We resolved the issue by deleting/renaming the old T2 data for SVOC-FS01 then running the scan again.

At the end of the meeting, we started the permissions scan from the schedule. It will likely take hours to finish. Please let us know when it has completed and if you see any other errors in the process. The errors we did see were about the missing security descriptors. This is common environmental issue. If you'd like to run those down, the errors should call out specific objects that should have their security descriptors reviewed/created.

Here is a brief summary of the troubleshooting steps we performed:

  *   checked host list being used by FSAA system scan and bulk import
     *   -SVOC-FS01 is on the list
  *   checked FSAA_Hosts table in SQL
     *   -SVOC-FS01 is not on that table
        *   --this is expected because they dropped the T1s for that host in a previous meeting
  *   No proxies being used--all scans run locally
  *   located and renamed T2 database folder for that host to SVOC-FS01.old0414
  *   configured host assignment for FSAA scan and bulk import to target only SVOC-FS01
  *   ran a zero-level scan from schedule
  *   the scan completed quickly with good data
  *   ran bulk import interactively
  *   checked FSAA_Hosts table again
     *   -confirmed SVOC-FS01 is now present on the table
  *   Set the scan depth back to 10 levels
     *   -will need to be set to full depth after confirming this scan completes
  *   Set host list assignment back to the original host list
  *   kicked off permissions group scan
