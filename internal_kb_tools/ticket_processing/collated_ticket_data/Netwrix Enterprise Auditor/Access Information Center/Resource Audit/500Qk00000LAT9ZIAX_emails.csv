Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Ian, 

 

Glad you’re back!  

 

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent



	
	
		Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
		We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC
	
	



	Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
	Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
	Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
	Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.



Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.


Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Ian, 

 

It looks like that did not work as expected – I think there must be another tweak that needs to happen.  Can we schedule another call?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the activity not populating in the nasuni heavy server.
From activity monitor we could see that the activity was being collected, but when we investigated enterprise auditor we found that only one of the two nasuni servers was actually being used in the jobs for activty.

We corrected this and started a collection. This will take some time as the new nasuni has much more activity and hasn't been scanned so some historical data is going to be collected as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job for completion and make sure the bulk import and exception jobs also run after the FSAC scan is complete.
Once this is done you should be able to see the activity in the AIC.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello, 

 

I am seeing events in the raw logs but not in this view. I do not see any of the reports populated in this view. 

I would be interested in jumping on a call – I actually think I know what the issue is but I would love validation before we randomly start pushing buttons.

Good morning!

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that.
When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…

  *   GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
  *   GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….



[cid:image004.png@01DB9261.D9A95D80]


My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

I am following up to see if you've had a chance to make the permissions changes that were needed on the Nasuni devices that Tay had gone over.
If you have any questions please let me know and I'd be happy to assist.

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:

  1.  Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent

  1.

     *   Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
     *   We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC

  1.  Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
  2.  Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
  3.  Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
  4.  Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.

Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.

It looks like that did not work as expected – I think there must be another tweak that needs to happen.  Can we schedule another call?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the activity not populating in the nasuni heavy server.
From activity monitor we could see that the activity was being collected, but when we investigated enterprise auditor we found that only one of the two nasuni servers was actually being used in the jobs for activty.

We corrected this and started a collection. This will take some time as the new nasuni has much more activity and hasn't been scanned so some historical data is going to be collected as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job for completion and make sure the bulk import and exception jobs also run after the FSAC scan is complete.
Once this is done you should be able to see the activity in the AIC.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello,

I am seeing events in the raw logs but not in this view. I do not see any of the reports populated in this view.
I would be interested in jumping on a call – I actually think I know what the issue is but I would love validation before we randomly start pushing buttons.

Yes when the FileSystem group runs it will run all groups and jobs in it sequentially.
If you only need portions daily I would schedule those separately and disable the full file system scheduled task as it is basically causing those jobs to be run twice.

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000LAT9Z:ref



Good morning! 

 

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that. 

When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…


	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni


 

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

 

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….

 

 

 



 



 

My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Ian, 

 

Glad you’re back!  

 

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Hello! 

 

Those changes will happen this week – however I am running into other problems with jobs taking longer than I expect and the console was unresponsive when opening this morning. After I canceled the “AD Activity List” everything started moving.

Ian, 

 

It looks like that did not work as expected – I think there must be another tweak that needs to happen.  Can we schedule another call?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the activity not populating in the nasuni heavy server.
From activity monitor we could see that the activity was being collected, but when we investigated enterprise auditor we found that only one of the two nasuni servers was actually being used in the jobs for activty.

We corrected this and started a collection. This will take some time as the new nasuni has much more activity and hasn't been scanned so some historical data is going to be collected as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job for completion and make sure the bulk import and exception jobs also run after the FSAC scan is complete.
Once this is done you should be able to see the activity in the AIC.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello, 

 

I am seeing events in the raw logs but not in this view. I do not see any of the reports populated in this view. 

I would be interested in jumping on a call – I actually think I know what the issue is but I would love validation before we randomly start pushing buttons.

Hello Michael,

Yes when the FileSystem group runs it will run all groups and jobs in it sequentially.
If you only need portions daily I would schedule those separately and disable the full file system scheduled task as it is basically causing those jobs to be run twice.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000LAT9Z:ref


Good morning!

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that.
When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…

  1.  GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
  2.  GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….



[cid:image001.png@01DB9264.21A75180]


My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian,

Glad you’re back!

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Hello!

Those changes will happen this week – however I am running into other problems with jobs taking longer than I expect and the console was unresponsive when opening this morning. After I canceled the “AD Activity List” everything started moving.

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:

  1.  Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent

  1.

  1.

     *   Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
     *   We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC

  1.  Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
  2.  Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
  3.  Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
  4.  Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.

Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.

Ian,

It looks like that did not work as expected – I think there must be another tweak that needs to happen.  Can we schedule another call?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the activity not populating in the nasuni heavy server.
From activity monitor we could see that the activity was being collected, but when we investigated enterprise auditor we found that only one of the two nasuni servers was actually being used in the jobs for activty.

We corrected this and started a collection. This will take some time as the new nasuni has much more activity and hasn't been scanned so some historical data is going to be collected as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job for completion and make sure the bulk import and exception jobs also run after the FSAC scan is complete.
Once this is done you should be able to see the activity in the AIC.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Michael,

Yes when the FileSystem group runs it will run all groups and jobs in it sequentially.
If you only need portions daily I would schedule those separately and disable the full file system scheduled task as it is basically causing those jobs to be run twice.

Thank you,

Good morning! 

 

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that. 

When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…


	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni


 

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

 

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….

 

 

 



 



 

My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian, 

 

Glad you’re back!  

 

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Hello! 

 

Those changes will happen this week – however I am running into other problems with jobs taking longer than I expect and the console was unresponsive when opening this morning. After I canceled the “AD Activity List” everything started moving.

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent



	 



	 



	
	
		Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
		We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC
	
	



	Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
	Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
	Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
	Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.



Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.


Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

I tried to run FileSystem0.Collection3.Activity and got this error.
[cid:image001.png@01DB9280.13248030]

Is the activity group I’m looking for called 5. Activity and all the groups within that?

Hello Michael,

Yes you can, activity does not rely on the permissions job at all so you can run it separate without any issue.

Hello Michael,

Yes when the FileSystem group runs it will run all groups and jobs in it sequentially.
If you only need portions daily I would schedule those separately and disable the full file system scheduled task as it is basically causing those jobs to be run twice.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000LAT9Z:ref


Good morning!

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that.
When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…

  1.  GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
  2.  GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….



[cid:image002.png@01DB9280.13248030]


My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian,

Glad you’re back!

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Hello!

Those changes will happen this week – however I am running into other problems with jobs taking longer than I expect and the console was unresponsive when opening this morning. After I canceled the “AD Activity List” everything started moving.

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:

  1.  Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
     *   We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC

  1.  Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
  2.  Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
  3.  Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
  4.  Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.

Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.

Ian,

It looks like that did not work as expected – I think there must be another tweak that needs to happen.  Can we schedule another call?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the activity not populating in the nasuni heavy server.
From activity monitor we could see that the activity was being collected, but when we investigated enterprise auditor we found that only one of the two nasuni servers was actually being used in the jobs for activty.

We corrected this and started a collection. This will take some time as the new nasuni has much more activity and hasn't been scanned so some historical data is going to be collected as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job for completion and make sure the bulk import and exception jobs also run after the FSAC scan is complete.
Once this is done you should be able to see the activity in the AIC.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

The job you are looking for is the the 0.Collections and 0.Collections-AzureNasuni groups.

Inside these groups you will see an FSAC scan and and FSAC bulk import job. Right now the bulk import needs to be run on both.
When you schedule the jobs make sure FSAC scan, then FSAC bulk import run in that order. The scan will collect the information, the bulk import moves it into the SQL database. The error you are seeing is because right now the scan has run but bulk import has not so it needs to import the data so it doesn't overwrite what it already has collected.

I tried to run FileSystem0.Collection3.Activity and got this error. 



 



Is the activity group I’m looking for called 5. Activity and all the groups within that?

Hello Michael,

Yes you can, activity does not rely on the permissions job at all so you can run it separate without any issue.

Hello Michael,

Yes when the FileSystem group runs it will run all groups and jobs in it sequentially.
If you only need portions daily I would schedule those separately and disable the full file system scheduled task as it is basically causing those jobs to be run twice.

Thank you,

Good morning! 

 

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that. 

When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…


	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni


 

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

 

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….

 

 

 



 



 

My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian, 

 

Glad you’re back!  

 

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Hello! 

 

Those changes will happen this week – however I am running into other problems with jobs taking longer than I expect and the console was unresponsive when opening this morning. After I canceled the “AD Activity List” everything started moving.

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
		We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC
	
	



	Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
	Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
	Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
	Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.



Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.


Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the activity not populating in the nasuni heavy server.
From activity monitor we could see that the activity was being collected, but when we investigated enterprise auditor we found that only one of the two nasuni servers was actually being used in the jobs for activty.

We corrected this and started a collection. This will take some time as the new nasuni has much more activity and hasn't been scanned so some historical data is going to be collected as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job for completion and make sure the bulk import and exception jobs also run after the FSAC scan is complete.
Once this is done you should be able to see the activity in the AIC.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Ian,

The error of “cannot scan, activity scan needs bulk import” is from job 1-FSAC SystemScans.

Hello Michael,

The job you are looking for is the the 0.Collections and 0.Collections-AzureNasuni groups.

Inside these groups you will see an FSAC scan and and FSAC bulk import job. Right now the bulk import needs to be run on both.
When you schedule the jobs make sure FSAC scan, then FSAC bulk import run in that order. The scan will collect the information, the bulk import moves it into the SQL database. The error you are seeing is because right now the scan has run but bulk import has not so it needs to import the data so it doesn't overwrite what it already has collected.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

I tried to run FileSystem0.Collection3.Activity and got this error.
[cid:image001.png@01DB9284.D3F02270]

Is the activity group I’m looking for called 5. Activity and all the groups within that?

Hello Michael,

Yes you can, activity does not rely on the permissions job at all so you can run it separate without any issue.

Hello Michael,

Yes when the FileSystem group runs it will run all groups and jobs in it sequentially.
If you only need portions daily I would schedule those separately and disable the full file system scheduled task as it is basically causing those jobs to be run twice.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000LAT9Z:ref


Good morning!

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that.
When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…

  1.  GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
  2.  GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….



[cid:image003.png@01DB9284.D3F02270]


My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian,

Glad you’re back!

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Hello!

Those changes will happen this week – however I am running into other problems with jobs taking longer than I expect and the console was unresponsive when opening this morning. After I canceled the “AD Activity List” everything started moving.

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:

  1.  Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
     *   We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC

  1.  Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
  2.  Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
  3.  Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
  4.  Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.

Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.

It looks like that did not work as expected – I think there must be another tweak that needs to happen.  Can we schedule another call?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the activity not populating in the nasuni heavy server.
From activity monitor we could see that the activity was being collected, but when we investigated enterprise auditor we found that only one of the two nasuni servers was actually being used in the jobs for activty.

We corrected this and started a collection. This will take some time as the new nasuni has much more activity and hasn't been scanned so some historical data is going to be collected as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job for completion and make sure the bulk import and exception jobs also run after the FSAC scan is complete.
Once this is done you should be able to see the activity in the AIC.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello,

I am seeing events in the raw logs but not in this view. I do not see any of the reports populated in this view.
I would be interested in jumping on a call – I actually think I know what the issue is but I would love validation before we randomly start pushing buttons.

That's because there is already a scan that has run that hasn't bulk imported yet. I would assume if your Access scan is still running that's why it can't run this scan since there is data in the tier 2 database that it can't overwrite until the bulk import runs.

If you'd like we can take a look at it live so I can better explain how this is working.

Ian, 

 

The error of “cannot scan, activity scan needs bulk import” is from job 1-FSAC SystemScans.

Hello Michael,

The job you are looking for is the the 0.Collections and 0.Collections-AzureNasuni groups.

Inside these groups you will see an FSAC scan and and FSAC bulk import job. Right now the bulk import needs to be run on both.
When you schedule the jobs make sure FSAC scan, then FSAC bulk import run in that order. The scan will collect the information, the bulk import moves it into the SQL database. The error you are seeing is because right now the scan has run but bulk import has not so it needs to import the data so it doesn't overwrite what it already has collected.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

I tried to run FileSystem0.Collection3.Activity and got this error. 



 



Is the activity group I’m looking for called 5. Activity and all the groups within that?

Hello Michael,

Yes you can, activity does not rely on the permissions job at all so you can run it separate without any issue.

Hello Michael,

Yes when the FileSystem group runs it will run all groups and jobs in it sequentially.
If you only need portions daily I would schedule those separately and disable the full file system scheduled task as it is basically causing those jobs to be run twice.

Thank you,

Good morning! 

 

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that. 

When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…


	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni


 

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

 

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….

 

 

 



 



 

My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Ian, 

 

Glad you’re back!  

 

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Hello! 

 

Those changes will happen this week – however I am running into other problems with jobs taking longer than I expect and the console was unresponsive when opening this morning. After I canceled the “AD Activity List” everything started moving.

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
		We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC
	
	



	Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
	Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
	Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
	Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.



Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the activity not populating in the nasuni heavy server.
From activity monitor we could see that the activity was being collected, but when we investigated enterprise auditor we found that only one of the two nasuni servers was actually being used in the jobs for activty.

We corrected this and started a collection. This will take some time as the new nasuni has much more activity and hasn't been scanned so some historical data is going to be collected as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job for completion and make sure the bulk import and exception jobs also run after the FSAC scan is complete.
Once this is done you should be able to see the activity in the AIC.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello, 

 

I am seeing events in the raw logs but not in this view. I do not see any of the reports populated in this view. 

I would be interested in jumping on a call – I actually think I know what the issue is but I would love validation before we randomly start pushing buttons.

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Validated that the bulk import job was working. It does show an error but it is due to a host being in the list that is not available any longer.
We validated in AIC that activities are being pulled in.
I also confirmed that you can run the normal FSAC scan daily without the FSAA scan and it won't be slowed by the Azure scan as this is being done by a proxy server.
Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they run overnight with no issue.
I will:
Follow up with you tomorrow to validate they are working.

Hello Michael,

That's because there is already a scan that has run that hasn't bulk imported yet. I would assume if your Access scan is still running that's why it can't run this scan since there is data in the tier 2 database that it can't overwrite until the bulk import runs.

If you'd like we can take a look at it live so I can better explain how this is working.

Ian, 

 

The error of “cannot scan, activity scan needs bulk import” is from job 1-FSAC SystemScans.

Hello Michael,

The job you are looking for is the the 0.Collections and 0.Collections-AzureNasuni groups.

Inside these groups you will see an FSAC scan and and FSAC bulk import job. Right now the bulk import needs to be run on both.
When you schedule the jobs make sure FSAC scan, then FSAC bulk import run in that order. The scan will collect the information, the bulk import moves it into the SQL database. The error you are seeing is because right now the scan has run but bulk import has not so it needs to import the data so it doesn't overwrite what it already has collected.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

I tried to run FileSystem0.Collection3.Activity and got this error. 



 



Is the activity group I’m looking for called 5. Activity and all the groups within that?

Hello Michael,

Yes you can, activity does not rely on the permissions job at all so you can run it separate without any issue.

Hello Michael,

Yes when the FileSystem group runs it will run all groups and jobs in it sequentially.
If you only need portions daily I would schedule those separately and disable the full file system scheduled task as it is basically causing those jobs to be run twice.

Thank you,

Good morning! 

 

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that. 

When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…


	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni


 

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

 

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….

 

 

 



 



 

My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Ian, 

 

Glad you’re back!  

 

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Hello! 

 

Those changes will happen this week – however I am running into other problems with jobs taking longer than I expect and the console was unresponsive when opening this morning. After I canceled the “AD Activity List” everything started moving.

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
		We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC
	
	



	Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
	Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
	Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
	Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.



Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.

Hello, 

 

I am seeing events in the raw logs but not in this view. I do not see any of the reports populated in this view. 

I would be interested in jumping on a call – I actually think I know what the issue is but I would love validation before we randomly start pushing buttons.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Validated that the bulk import job was working. It does show an error but it is due to a host being in the list that is not available any longer.
We validated in AIC that activities are being pulled in.
I also confirmed that you can run the normal FSAC scan daily without the FSAA scan and it won't be slowed by the Azure scan as this is being done by a proxy server.
Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they run overnight with no issue.
I will:
Follow up with you tomorrow to validate they are working.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello Michael,

That's because there is already a scan that has run that hasn't bulk imported yet. I would assume if your Access scan is still running that's why it can't run this scan since there is data in the tier 2 database that it can't overwrite until the bulk import runs.

If you'd like we can take a look at it live so I can better explain how this is working.

Ian, 

 

The error of “cannot scan, activity scan needs bulk import” is from job 1-FSAC SystemScans.

Hello Michael,

The job you are looking for is the the 0.Collections and 0.Collections-AzureNasuni groups.

Inside these groups you will see an FSAC scan and and FSAC bulk import job. Right now the bulk import needs to be run on both.
When you schedule the jobs make sure FSAC scan, then FSAC bulk import run in that order. The scan will collect the information, the bulk import moves it into the SQL database. The error you are seeing is because right now the scan has run but bulk import has not so it needs to import the data so it doesn't overwrite what it already has collected.

Thank you,

I tried to run FileSystem0.Collection3.Activity and got this error. 



 



Is the activity group I’m looking for called 5. Activity and all the groups within that?

Hello Michael,

Yes you can, activity does not rely on the permissions job at all so you can run it separate without any issue.

Hello Michael,

Yes when the FileSystem group runs it will run all groups and jobs in it sequentially.
If you only need portions daily I would schedule those separately and disable the full file system scheduled task as it is basically causing those jobs to be run twice.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000LAT9Z:ref

 


Good morning! 

 

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that. 

When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…


	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni


 

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

 

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….

 

 

 



 



 

My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Ian, 

 

Glad you’re back!  

 

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Hello! 

 

Those changes will happen this week – however I am running into other problems with jobs taking longer than I expect and the console was unresponsive when opening this morning. After I canceled the “AD Activity List” everything started moving.

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
		We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC
	
	



	Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
	Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
	Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
	Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.



Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.

Ian, 

 

It looks like that did not work as expected – I think there must be another tweak that needs to happen.  Can we schedule another call?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the activity not populating in the nasuni heavy server.
From activity monitor we could see that the activity was being collected, but when we investigated enterprise auditor we found that only one of the two nasuni servers was actually being used in the jobs for activty.

We corrected this and started a collection. This will take some time as the new nasuni has much more activity and hasn't been scanned so some historical data is going to be collected as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job for completion and make sure the bulk import and exception jobs also run after the FSAC scan is complete.
Once this is done you should be able to see the activity in the AIC.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

Hello, 

 

I am seeing events in the raw logs but not in this view. I do not see any of the reports populated in this view. 

I would be interested in jumping on a call – I actually think I know what the issue is but I would love validation before we randomly start pushing buttons.

Ian,

Thank you for all of your help.
I believe that Netwrix is in a much better place than when we started.

I will be out of the office next week, and I’ve started a project to get the permissions corrected on the entire file share, which is apparently a mess.

I do not think there is anything further that we can do with Netwrix until that is resolved so this ticket should probably be closed – but I am also reluctant to let you go because you’ve been fantastic.

Is there a way when opening a ticket I can request you?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Validated that the bulk import job was working. It does show an error but it is due to a host being in the list that is not available any longer.
We validated in AIC that activities are being pulled in.
I also confirmed that you can run the normal FSAC scan daily without the FSAA scan and it won't be slowed by the Azure scan as this is being done by a proxy server.
Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they run overnight with no issue.
I will:
Follow up with you tomorrow to validate they are working.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello Michael,

That's because there is already a scan that has run that hasn't bulk imported yet. I would assume if your Access scan is still running that's why it can't run this scan since there is data in the tier 2 database that it can't overwrite until the bulk import runs.

If you'd like we can take a look at it live so I can better explain how this is working.

Ian,

The error of “cannot scan, activity scan needs bulk import” is from job 1-FSAC SystemScans.

Hello Michael,

The job you are looking for is the the 0.Collections and 0.Collections-AzureNasuni groups.

Inside these groups you will see an FSAC scan and and FSAC bulk import job. Right now the bulk import needs to be run on both.
When you schedule the jobs make sure FSAC scan, then FSAC bulk import run in that order. The scan will collect the information, the bulk import moves it into the SQL database. The error you are seeing is because right now the scan has run but bulk import has not so it needs to import the data so it doesn't overwrite what it already has collected.

Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom

I tried to run FileSystem0.Collection3.Activity and got this error.
[cid:image001.png@01DB98CD.5C723DB0]

Is the activity group I’m looking for called 5. Activity and all the groups within that?

Yes you can, activity does not rely on the permissions job at all so you can run it separate without any issue.

Hello Michael,

Yes when the FileSystem group runs it will run all groups and jobs in it sequentially.
If you only need portions daily I would schedule those separately and disable the full file system scheduled task as it is basically causing those jobs to be run twice.

Thank you,

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000LAT9Z:ref


Good morning!

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that.
When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…

  1.  GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
  2.  GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….



[cid:image003.png@01DB98CD.5C723DB0]


My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian,

Glad you’re back!

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Hello!

Those changes will happen this week – however I am running into other problems with jobs taking longer than I expect and the console was unresponsive when opening this morning. After I canceled the “AD Activity List” everything started moving.

Hello Michael,

I am following up to see if you've had a chance to make the permissions changes that were needed on the Nasuni devices that Tay had gone over.
If you have any questions please let me know and I'd be happy to assist.

Thank you,

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:

  1.  Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

  1.

     *   Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
     *   We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC

  1.  Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
  2.  Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
  3.  Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
  4.  Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.

Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.

It looks like that did not work as expected – I think there must be another tweak that needs to happen.  Can we schedule another call?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the activity not populating in the nasuni heavy server.
From activity monitor we could see that the activity was being collected, but when we investigated enterprise auditor we found that only one of the two nasuni servers was actually being used in the jobs for activty.

We corrected this and started a collection. This will take some time as the new nasuni has much more activity and hasn't been scanned so some historical data is going to be collected as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job for completion and make sure the bulk import and exception jobs also run after the FSAC scan is complete.
Once this is done you should be able to see the activity in the AIC.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello,

I am seeing events in the raw logs but not in this view. I do not see any of the reports populated in this view.
I would be interested in jumping on a call – I actually think I know what the issue is but I would love validation before we randomly start pushing buttons.

Thank you for your time and patience on this issue and I am glad that we were able to get your issue resolved for you. 


If you require assistance in the future, please feel free to open a ticket and we'd be happy to assist with any additional problems you may have.
Normally our tickets are assigned to the next available engineer, but once you get a ticket assigned, we can try to accommodate if you would like to work with a specific engineer if they are available. If you are assigned a different engineer feel free to ask them to reassign it to your preferred engineer and if they are available we will do so.


The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Issue:
Activity Information only showing for one Nasuni device.


Resolution:
- Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent
--- Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
--- We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC

- Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.

-Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs

-Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.

-Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.

At this time I will be closing your ticket out for you. This case can be re-opened at any time if any related issues return. 
Please feel free to reach out to the Netwrix team if you have any additional questions or would like assistance with any issues. Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case has been closed.
You will also receive a survey link, it would help us greatly to improve our support service if you could provide any feedback that you may have regarding your experience with this case.

Ian, 

 

Thank you for all of your help. 

I believe that Netwrix is in a much better place than when we started. 

 

I will be out of the office next week, and I’ve started a project to get the permissions corrected on the entire file share, which is apparently a mess. 

 

I do not think there is anything further that we can do with Netwrix until that is resolved so this ticket should probably be closed – but I am also reluctant to let you go because you’ve been fantastic. 

 

Is there a way when opening a ticket I can request you?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Validated that the bulk import job was working. It does show an error but it is due to a host being in the list that is not available any longer.
We validated in AIC that activities are being pulled in.
I also confirmed that you can run the normal FSAC scan daily without the FSAA scan and it won't be slowed by the Azure scan as this is being done by a proxy server.
Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they run overnight with no issue.
I will:
Follow up with you tomorrow to validate they are working.





Thank you,

Hello Michael,

That's because there is already a scan that has run that hasn't bulk imported yet. I would assume if your Access scan is still running that's why it can't run this scan since there is data in the tier 2 database that it can't overwrite until the bulk import runs.

If you'd like we can take a look at it live so I can better explain how this is working.

Ian, 

 

The error of “cannot scan, activity scan needs bulk import” is from job 1-FSAC SystemScans.

Hello Michael,

The job you are looking for is the the 0.Collections and 0.Collections-AzureNasuni groups.

Inside these groups you will see an FSAC scan and and FSAC bulk import job. Right now the bulk import needs to be run on both.
When you schedule the jobs make sure FSAC scan, then FSAC bulk import run in that order. The scan will collect the information, the bulk import moves it into the SQL database. The error you are seeing is because right now the scan has run but bulk import has not so it needs to import the data so it doesn't overwrite what it already has collected.

Thank you,

I tried to run FileSystem0.Collection3.Activity and got this error. 



 



Is the activity group I’m looking for called 5. Activity and all the groups within that?

Hello Michael,

Yes you can, activity does not rely on the permissions job at all so you can run it separate without any issue.

Hello Michael,

Yes when the FileSystem group runs it will run all groups and jobs in it sequentially.
If you only need portions daily I would schedule those separately and disable the full file system scheduled task as it is basically causing those jobs to be run twice.

Thank you,

Good morning! 

 

My azr-nasuni scan is still chugging along so I don’t have any update with that. 

When JobsGroup_FileSystem runs, it would also run all of the subfolders correct?  So running Group_FileSystem would also run…


	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.CollectionGroup_3.Activity
	GroupFileSystemGroup_0.Collection-AzureNasuni


 

I am wondering if I want to run the two jobs independently so that the on prem is not held up by the azure-nasuni collection. Does that make sense?

 

If I do that then I won’t run any of the other FileSystem subjobs like open access, direct permissions or broken inheritance….

 

 

 



 



 

My concern is I need activity information daily.  I do not need permission activity daily.

Hello Michael,

I am following up as agreed to validate that your scans worked as expected.
Can you let me know what the current status is on this?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
We looked into the AD_AccessChanges job and saw that it was apparently not progressing. After manually testing the script we found that there may be a bottleneck on the SQL server as it is checking against the new nasuni information for group access.
We changed the schedule on the AD jobs to run daily with the exception of the AD_AccessChange group which will run weekly on Fridays.
Looked into the scans and made sure they were working to the nasuni.
We setup the proxy server to scan your cloud based nasuni device as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the scans to ensure they are working as expected once they have finished.
I will:
Follow up after the Friday scan to validate the scan completed.





Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Ian, 

 

Glad you’re back!  

 

Can you send me a schedule link?  I know those are often a few days out and I’m optimistic we’ll be able to get progress made on the permissions – I was also able to get the proxy server installed but not configured to scan azure yet.

Hello Michael,

We may want to look at spacing the jobs out a little more. If they are overlapping it could be eating up enough resources that we're slowing the server down and making it unresponsive.

Thank you,

Hello! 

 

Those changes will happen this week – however I am running into other problems with jobs taking longer than I expect and the console was unresponsive when opening this morning. After I canceled the “AD Activity List” everything started moving.

Hello Michael,

I am following up to see if you've had a chance to make the permissions changes that were needed on the Nasuni devices that Tay had gone over.
If you have any questions please let me know and I'd be happy to assist.

Hey Michael,

Apologies for the delayed meeting summary, but I appreciate you meeting with me this week. To recap our meeting, we:


	Removed the host mapping feature from the FSAC System Scan- this appears to resolve the issue of NEA querying every host against every agent



	 



	 



	 



	 



	 



	
	
		Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
		We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC
	
	



	Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.
	Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs
	Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we don’t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.
	Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.



Once you've had a chance to work out those Access Denied errors on your Nasuni filers and give the connection profile account at least rights to view permissions (Local Admin is recommended) let me know how things in the AIC look!

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Verified that the job for nasuni was run and that data was imported into the database.
We verified that activity data is displaying in some areas, but not others.
The issue appears to be how AIC is interpreting the data it sees in the database.

Our next steps are:

I will:
Engage our internal teams to try and get a better understanding of how Nasuni and NEA work together.
I will also engage an AIC specialist to see if we can find out why the display doesn't appear to match what is in the database.


Please use this link to schedule our next meeting at your convenience

Ian, 

 

It looks like that did not work as expected – I think there must be another tweak that needs to happen.  Can we schedule another call?

Hello Michael,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Looked into the activity not populating in the nasuni heavy server.
From activity monitor we could see that the activity was being collected, but when we investigated enterprise auditor we found that only one of the two nasuni servers was actually being used in the jobs for activty.

We corrected this and started a collection. This will take some time as the new nasuni has much more activity and hasn't been scanned so some historical data is going to be collected as well.

Our next steps are:
You will:
Monitor the job for completion and make sure the bulk import and exception jobs also run after the FSAC scan is complete.
Once this is done you should be able to see the activity in the AIC.


Thank you,
Ian Ranstrom
Senior Technical Support Engineer

Hello, 

 

I am seeing events in the raw logs but not in this view. I do not see any of the reports populated in this view. 

I would be interested in jumping on a call – I actually think I know what the issue is but I would love validation before we randomly start pushing buttons.
