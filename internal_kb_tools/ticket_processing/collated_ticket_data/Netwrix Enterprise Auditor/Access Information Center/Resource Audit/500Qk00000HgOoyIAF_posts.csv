OnlineDC) to create a dynamic host list for the 1-AD_Scan. Even though the job says it is working successfully, the logs show it erroring out with ""Unable to create host list""

We deleted the dynamic host list from the 0.OnlineDC job and recreated it. We then kicked off the 1-AD_Scan. We want to verify that the host list continues to work after the first run.
