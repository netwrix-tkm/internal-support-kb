Hi Ilia

I'm not sure the version of the AIC or StealthAudit is likely to be the problem and it may not be a problem, it might be how its designed - which is fine - but some clarity would be good.

StealthAudit = 11.5.0.165
AIC = 11.5.0.103

Since I raised this call I connected my Power BI report that I referenced in Netwrix Support Ticket #413360 and I would suggest this is more accurate.  For example, I can drill down to the particular share or sub-folder and confirm who actually accessed the share on in the screenshot attached to the call rather than the direct child items.

So I would suggest the AIC is showing us who accesses the share and one level down.

Hi Ilia

I'm not sure the version of the AIC or StealthAudit is likely to be the problem and it may not be a problem, it might be how its designed - which is fine - but some clarity would be good.

StealthAudit = 11.5.0.165
AIC = 11.5.0.103

Since I raised this call I connected my Power BI report that I referenced in Netwrix Support Ticket #413360 and I would suggest this is more accurate.  For example, I can drill down to the particular share or sub-folder and confirm who actually accessed the share on in the screenshot attached to the call rather than the direct child items.

So I would suggest the AIC is showing us who accesses the share and one level down.

Hello Mark,

Thank you for connecting Netwrix Technical Support!

Could you please also provide a version of StealthAUDIT and AIC you have installed? I will double-check all the fixes related to this.

I reproduced it in my lab (Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6v) and it works according to the ""Including subfolder"" condition:

Hi Ilia

I have a task in my backlog to upgrade AIC in our production environment to 11.5.0.136 anyway.

When we migrated our test StealthAudit master server from a 2012 server to a new 2022 server we had some issues with the AIC.  It was recommended to upgrade to the latest version.  It didn't fix that issue, it was a problem around port bindings but when it came to migrating our prod Master Server I forgot that we had upgraded test.

However, this does give me an opportunity to validate whether upgrading it fixes the problem but it doesn't I'm afraid.  So maybe its one of those things that will be fixed in 11.6.

So to summarise, there is a bug in AIC 11.5 that shows the top level of the share + the next level.  However, as I have tapped into the SQL database using the table you previously recommended (SA_FSAC_ActivityEventsView) I can see the data in my Power BI report.

If that is an accurate statement, please close the call.

Hello Mark,

Have you noticed the same behaviour for not Isilon resources (Windows, NetApp)? I will request some help for this issue but as a first step - it would be great to upgrade AIC to the latest build.

Thank you!

I am waiting for some comments on this - but most likely the product team will advise to upgrade both: StealthAUDIT, and AIC to the latest build of the 11.5 version.

Thank you!

Hello Mark,

I reproduced it in my lab (Netwrix Enterprise Auditor 11.6v) and it works according to the ""Including subfolder"" condition:

[cid:image002.png@01DAD2CB.FEF31AF0]

[cid:image003.png@01DAD2CB.FEF31AF0]

Could you also clarify the SAM version? What resource did you scan (Isilon, NetApp, Windows File server)? The issue can be related to SAM.

Thank you!

Hi Ilia

I'm not sure the version of the AIC or StealthAudit is likely to be the problem and it may not be a problem, it might be how its designed - which is fine - but some clarity would be good.

StealthAudit = 11.5.0.165
AIC = 11.5.0.103

Since I raised this call I connected my Power BI report that I referenced in Netwrix Support Ticket #413360 and I would suggest this is more accurate.  For example, I can drill down to the particular share or sub-folder and confirm who actually accessed the share on in the screenshot attached to the call rather than the direct child items.

So I would suggest the AIC is showing us who accesses the share and one level down.

Most likely the issue was resolved in 11.6 since I cannot see this bug in my lab (but I cannot see any notes on this in Bug Fix documents truth to be told). As I clarified - the issue is not related to SAM or Isilon events. I will re-open the issue if will get any updates from the team.

Hi Ilia

 

I have a task in my backlog to upgrade AIC in our production environment to 11.5.0.136 anyway.

 

When we migrated our test StealthAudit master server from a 2012 server to a new 2022 server we had some issues with the AIC.  It was recommended to upgrade to the latest version.  It didn’t fix that issue, it was a problem around port bindings but when it came to migrating our prod Master Server I forgot that we had upgraded test.
