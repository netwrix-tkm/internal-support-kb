Nasuni is displaying the info in the database in a strange way. I can see entries in the database for the HVY server, but in the AIC the shares are not visible. Hoping FSAC scan will correct this to some degree as there is no activity shown on this Nasuni either. This may be an oddity of how Nasuni works as the storage is shared across them.","","","","005Qk000002AJWTIA4","2025-02-25T14:36:21.000Z"

--- Once we did this, we had a successful scan- minus the one host who does not have an agent configured for monitoring yet
--- We also see the activity data correlating to the correct hosts in the AIC

- Removed the analysis tasks from various weekly reports as the table is already being created when the job runs, these jobs are just used to create a filtered report from the already collected data. This should increase their speed.

-Removed the Group Usage group from File System Activity and moved it to the AD Activity group where it belongs

-Found AIC Effective Access Report was still not displaying for deeper than the first couple of folder levels, but this looks to be caused by the fact we donâ€™t have rights to read permissions on the deeper levels.

-Removed a second DC from the ADI scan that was within the same domain already being scanned.","","","","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2025-02-28T17:24:31.000Z"
