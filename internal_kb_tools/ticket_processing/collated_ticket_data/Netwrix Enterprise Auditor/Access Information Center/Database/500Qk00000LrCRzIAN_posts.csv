2025_0218: Meeting summary
+++++

1) Unknown protocol: VSS - Volume Shadow Copy Service
We pick up the activity but we do not do anything with that activity.

+++++
NAM > Monitored Hosts > File: C:Program FilesStealthbitsStealthAudit > Edit output > Operations tab > VSS Operations > un-check all 3 at the top
+++++

+++++
Snapshot add
Snapshot delete - may be checkedselected by default
Read
+++++
CTRL-A to select all 41 at once time

""Saving 0/28"" - next to OK BTN - 28 INI files to update but then it will roll pretty quick
+++++

2) DC2-P-FILE-02 - had no file output - no PATH to ""DC2-P-FILE-02_Log.tsv""
""C:Program FilesStealthbitsStealthAUDITFSAcSBTFileMon_LogsDC2-P-FILE-02_Log_.tsv""
(click the 3 dots to navigate and click the ""Test"" BUTTON) 

3) In NAM, we checked the 'Account Exclusions' TAB:
+++++
NT AUTHORITYIUSR
NT AUTHORITYSYSTEM
NT AUTHORITYLOCAL SERVICE
NT AUTHORITYNETWORK SERVICE
+++++

4) Checked both NEA Jobs - 
1-FSAA System Scans - hit a timeout of some sort
2-FSAA Bulk Import - just one host had a problem

5) NEA AIC > Resource Audit > \DC2-P-FILE-02Scanner > Activity Details > Date range: 02/11/2025 - 02/18/2025

Date range: 12/30/2025 - 01/07/2025
NEA > 2.Activity > 1-FSAC System Scans > Results > Activity - find a server that has a lot of activity events
+++++
In AIC > DCP-APPS-02 > Activity Details and Activity Statistics - there is lots of data
column hidden = called ""Target Path"" - for moves this is how you know where the data/file went
+++++

+++++
Retention value in the NEA console itself
+++++
NEA > 2.Activity > 1-FSAC System Scans > Configure > Queries > Query Properties > Configure BUTTON > 
Activity Settings > ""Set scan filter for detailed activity"" > 60 days

6) In NAM > 'Monitored Hosts' tab > 'DC2-P-FILE-02.polsinelli.law' > 'Additional Properties' TAB > 'Report hostname as' = ${NETBIOS_NAME}

Is there a variable for this?
like ${NETBIOS_NAME}

Right-click on the actual host > Windows tab > 'Report the host name as:' NETBIOS name OR FQDN

7) SI Agent Installer registers NETBIOS name as the Machine name (in the UI and DB)
Separate Files:
NEA uses = ""C:Program FilesSTEATLHbitsSteatlhAUDITFSACSBTFileMon_Logs<NETBIOS_NAME>_Log_.tsv"" = NEA uses
NAM uses = ""C:ProgramDatgaNetwrixActivity MonitorAgentSBTFileMon_LogsSBTFileMon_Log_.tsv"" = NAM uses
(same data but in different format)
NAM versus SI team

8) NEA > GROUP_2.Activity > ""1-FSAC Systems Scans""
""DC2-P-FILE-02"" - did not have 'Report hostname as' set up correctly.

2.Activity > ""Run Group""

""Remove old hosts"" JOB > Results > DEFAULT > Right-click on the HOST column and ""Group By"" to see concise list of 17 hosts (or whatever the ""SA_FSAA_Hosts"" table contains)

9) NEA > ""Host Management"" > FILESERVERS - ensure that the 17 servers have been removed from this list

10) 1-SEEK System Scans > MESSAGE = ""Failed to delete...FSAA<SERVERNAME>SDDTemp - not crtical as this is a TEMP DIR that NEA uses.
You can manually empty that directory if you want.

11) ""DC2-P-FILE-02"" - is it running an old leftover applet?
""DC2-P-FILE-02"" - a lot of files are collected but then it errors.

FSAA DC Wizard > Query Selection > Maintenance > ""Remove scan executable and data"" - Remove FSAA applet and data from remote server(s).
+++++
Created a new ""Remove_Applet_FSAA"" job (in the Custom_Job_Folder) > Configure > Queries > Data Collector drop-down = FILESYSTEMACCESS >
Query Selection > Maintenance > ""Remove scan executable and data"" - Remove FSAA applet and data from remote server(s).

Hosts > Host name - added ""DC2-P-FILE-02""
+++++

12) ""2-FSAAC Bulk Import"" - is now succeeding and took about 8 minutes 47 seconds for the successful run

13) 'Remove old hosts' job MESSAGES:
+++++
Host is offline
Abort request received
Host processing aborted
+++++

14) AIC > <SERVER_NAME> > Activity Details
Drill into specific folders and AIC is displaying data after all of the NEA fixes that we applied

15) FS_StaleContent > re-run this report job after the 'Remove old hosts' job completes successfully

16) ""Remove old hosts"" JOB >  Error removing DCP-ARCHIVE-01 from tier 1 database: Failed to remove Host ID: 5 from table SA_FSAA_Resources
Renamed hostname from ""DCP-ARCHIVE-01"" to !REMOVED_DCP-ARCHIVE-01_<MORE_IDENTIFIERS>
Add ""code-renamed"" hostname to ""Remove old hosts"" JOB > Configure > Hosts list.
