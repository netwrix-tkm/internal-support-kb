I am unable to log in to AIC site. Error ""Unable to contact the SQL Server Database""

Cause:
SQL Server Data and Logs drive was very low in space. We added some space to both drives

Resolution:
The Database that was consuming all the Disk space was for Netwrix Threat Prevention (NTP) formally StealthINTERCEPT Server (SI).
Configured the NTP Database Maintenance to correctly maintain the NVMonitorData DB.
