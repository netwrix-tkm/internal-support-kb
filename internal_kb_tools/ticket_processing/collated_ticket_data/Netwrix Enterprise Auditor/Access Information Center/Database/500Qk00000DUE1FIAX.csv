"500Qk00000DUE1FIAX","00415933","Support Ticket","Issues with importing groups","We are having issues with importing this group: NA-MEASAppServers-G. It is not in the AIC (1), and when importing, it pulls in with green status (2), but it throws an error when processing the import (3). I attached the logs, where it throws an error:
2024-06-27 07:56:46 -- Error  -- client 164.103.107.16  Message: Violation of UNIQUE KEY constraint 'UQ_SA_AIC_Resources'. Cannot insert duplicate key in object 'dbo.SA_AIC_Resources'. The duplicate key value is (NAIPAPERNA-MEASAppServers-G).

Do you have any ideas for what it causing the error? Or should we open a ticket for Netwrix to review?","","","","Current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA) formally StealthAUDIT (SA)                                                                11.5.0.272
Netwrix Access Information Center (AIC) formally StealthAUDIT Access Information Center (AIC)      115.0.136

Found that the Groups in question (NA-MEASAppServers-G , etc) were listed as IsDeleted used the following to update the SQL tables.

UPDATE [SA_ADInventory_Principals] Set [IsDeleted]  = 0
WHERE ID = 194019 OR ID = 163088 OR ID = 177012 OR ID = 187014

Post matching them in the [SA_ADInventory_GroupsView] table via the [PrincipalId]
Kicked of a new ADI differential scan, post confirming that the Group was in the correct OU via  DistinguishedName attribute.

Corrected the Drop AD job  ADIreset a schedule was created to be able to run manually 4 pm on Friday.
Then Re-run the ADI job group to repopulate.
The Drop job will be kicked off on Friday then the import check for Monday morning.


The following were noted during the call to have issues within the AIC
2 groups that were having the 404 Error and are now NOT having the issue:
NAIPAPER1F9-Identicard-G
NAIPAPER02A-SAPCD-G

2 groups that are currently still having the 404 Error and ARE having the issue:
NAIPAPER00F-GROOMSGAMBLE-G
NAIPAPER027-Design Backups -G

Example NAIPAPERNA-All_RSAdminsPCs-G          <<< all computer accounts    No issues
NAIPAPERNA-MEASAppServers-G - still having import issues   <<< all computer accounts

3B5-Finished Products Training Records-D - previously in Resource Owners with 404 error, removed, and unable to re-import

Thank You for your time.

--THEN 
--  ID in the SA_ADInventory_Principals is the same for the PrincipalId via SA_ADInventory_GroupsView

Recreated the error within the AIC UI listed the group in question as a duplicate again

gci ""C:inetpubwwwrootStealthAUDIT Compliance*.log"" -Recurse |Select-String NA-MEASAppServers-G 

Listed the object as a duplicate in the SA_AIC_Resources table.
We found the Object with
SELECT TOP (1000) [ID]
      ,[Type]
      ,[Value]
  FROM [SA_AIC_Resources]
  WHERE [Value] LIKE '%NA-MEASAppServers-G%'

DELETE FROM [SA_AIC_Resources]
WHERE ID = 49222  -- This matched the value from the last query
