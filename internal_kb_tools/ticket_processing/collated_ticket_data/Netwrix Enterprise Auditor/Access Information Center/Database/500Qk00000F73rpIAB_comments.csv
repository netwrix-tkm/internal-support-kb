"00aQk000008v6GzIAI","500Qk00000F73rpIAB","The customer is unable to install the AIC. When installing it, we get an error message: ""SQL Error: Login failed for user 'nprdstealthaudit'.""
I advised the customer to try a .udl test to ensure the user can access the database, and the test was successful.
The customer can connect to SSMS with the same user with no issues.
In Management Studio, I verified the permission for the user, the user is a db owner
 
I told the customer we would investigate and get back to him.","0054u000007osjSAAQ","2024-09-04T23:25:07.000Z","2024-09-04T23:25:07.000Z","false","false"

We check the connection to the database through a udl test.
We test the connection to make sure ports 81 and 481 are open.
I double-checked the registry ""ComputerHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREStealthbits"" to find out if the Access Information Center was previously installed."
