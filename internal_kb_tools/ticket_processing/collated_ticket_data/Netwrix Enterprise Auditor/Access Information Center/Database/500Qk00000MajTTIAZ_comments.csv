@Michael Burrofato @Helen Randall @WaitingOnEngineer

The ID column is an identity column in the SA_AIC_Resources table so is it possible that it got removed from the ID column when the customer restored the table?

Can the customer run the following query, please?


--- CODE ---
SELECT
  name, 
 is_identity 
FROM sys.columns
WHERE
 object_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.SA_AIC_Resources')  AND
 name = 'ID'

--- CODE ---

If the is_identity column is 0 then you can make the ID column identity by following these steps:

	 - 	Right click on the ID column:
	 - 	Select Modify
	 - 	Select the ID column if it's not selected in the right top panel
	 - 	Then, in the bottom panel, go to the ""Identity Specification"" section and select yes to the ""Is Identity"" property.

Uploaded a couple of screenshots(Identity Column.zip).

The following script drops the FK keys that reference to SA_AIC_Resources, turns ON identity on the ID column, and adds the FK keys back.

It might take time if the SA_AIC_Resources table is big in the customer environment.

You can verify that the ID column is the identity column by running this SQL query:

--- CODE ---
SELECT
  name,
 is_identity
FROM sys.columns
WHERE
 object_id = OBJECT_ID('dbo.SA_AIC_Resources')  AND
 name = 'ID'

--- CODE ---

This SQL query shows you all the FK references on SA_AIC_Resources table. Make sure it returns 5 rows (uploaded a screenshot ""FKs references on AIC resources.png"" to SharePoint)

The original error the customer encountered with the ""SA_AIC_Resources"" table has been resolved. However, they are now experiencing the same error with a different table, ""SA_AIC_ResourceReviews"". I'm uncertain about how the customer restored their tables, but it seems the AIC tables are missing identity columns. I suspect that after addressing the issue with ""SA_AIC_ResourceReviews"", the same error might occur with other tables.

Could you please run the following SQL query and share the results with me?



--- CODE ---


SELECT

 t.name AS tableName,
 c.name AS columnName,
 is_identity
FROM sys.columns c
JOIN sys.tables t ON
  t.object_id = c.object_id
WHERE
 t.name like 'SA_AIC%' AND
 is_identity = 1
ORDER BY t.name


--- CODE ---

The query returns the AIC tables that has identity column and it should return 14 tables on the ""ID"" column

12 AIC tables are missing an identity column. We have to perform the same steps that we did for the SA_AIC_Resources for those AIC tables to add the identity column back.


	 - 	Drop FK references if any
	 - 	Create a table with an identity column
	 - 	Turn ON identity insert
	 - 	Insert data from the original table
	 - 	Turn OFF identity insert
	 - 	Drop the original table
	 - 	Rename the table
	 - 	Add FK references if any

I will provide the SQL queries. 

Does the Engineer think that this is the only problem with the customer's database?

I uploaded the SQL script ""AIC Add Identity Column.sql"" that adds the identity columns to the AIC tables. The script executes the following steps for each table, so if the table is large, it might take a long time to finish. 

	 - 	Drop FK references if any
	 - 	Create a table with an identity column
	 - 	Turn ON identity insert
	 - 	Insert data from the original table
	 - 	Turn OFF identity insert
	 - 	Drop the original table
	 - 	Rename the table
	 - 	Add constraints or indexes
	 - 	Add FK references if any

Please take a backup of your DB before you run the attached script.

Once it executes successfully, run the following query to make sure that the identity column is added to the necessary AIC tables.


--- CODE ---SELECT

 t.name AS tableName,
 c.name AS columnName,
 is_identity
FROM sys.columns c
JOIN sys.tables t ON
  t.object_id = c.object_id
WHERE
 t.name like 'SA_AIC%' AND
 is_identity = 1
ORDER BY t.name
