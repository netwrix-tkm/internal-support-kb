Hi, we have 2 follow up questions:

	 - 	Is there a willingness to start over again with the AIC SQL DB?
	 - 	Could you please provide more detailed information on the steps which were taken during the stage where tables were dropped and then restored? Is it possible to get:

	 - 	A list of all the tables that were impacted
	 - 	More detail around if this process happened before/during/after the upgrade from 11.5 to 11.6. 
	 - 	Any information about the previous ticket you mentioned that resulted in these tables being dropped.

So Long story short. old 11.5 install that was abandoned.
it had data from Several DC's some old some current.
Plan originally was to drop all tables that has significant data to free up space. Mostly FS tables
we went in circles with the Authentication table but ended up just reinstalling and manually setting up that access.
We tried to restore all AIC tables but had to reinstall to correct schema.

Potentially relevant tables.
All tables starting with SA_FS
This table was removed when I filtered tables based on SP being in the name.

The provided table ""SA_AIC_ResourceOwners"" doesn't have any duplicate combination of resource and owner. I do remember when we joined SA_AIC_ResourceOwners table with the AD principal view it showed some duplicate data so my guess is there might be something wrong with AD tables. Can we run the following queries, and provide the result, please?


--- CODE ---
SELECT *
FROM SA_ADInventory_PrincipalsView
WHERE ObjectSId = 'S-1-5-21-1715567821-2025429265-1417001333-1809'
--- CODE ---

Or if you see any duplicate data in the view.


--- CODE ---
SELECT Value, count(*) 
FROM SA_AIC_Resources
GROUP BY Value
--- CODE ---

Also, can you export SA_AIC_Resources and SA_AIC_ResourceOptions tables to CSV and send them to us, please?

These are the tables related to reviews, you can try to restore them from your backup.

	 - 	SA_AIC_ResourceReviews
	 - 	SA_AIC_ResourceReviewData
	 - 	SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponses
	 - 	SA_AIC_ResourceReviewResponseDetails
	 - 	SA_AIC_ResourceReviewTrusteeData
	 - 	SA_AIC_ResourceOptions

The table schema is changed in 11.6 so if your backup is from 11.5 then restoring wouldn't work. You can try setting the old schema version (2.0) to SA_AIC_SchemaCersion after restoring those tables and restarting the AIC service that will update the tables.

So yes, there is duplicate data in the AD inventory principal view (as you can see in the pic1.png provided by the customer) and I suspect that other AD inventory tables might have duplicate data too. Can the engineer or customer verify this, please? By the way, I don't see any duplicates in the attached AIC tables.


** from pic1.png

Can the customer try dropping the AD Inventory tables and re-scan the AD environment, please?

The AIC uses AD Inventory tables to pull user and group information and if there are no duplicate users or groups in the ADI table, the AIC shows owners and reviews correctly.
