The customer has an issue with 144 connections coming from the AIC application server with no login name and 21 connections using the local “sa” account configured in the AIC console according to analysis from the SQL server. That is the reason for 100% CPU usage and slow AIC response ( AIC is usable for some time after a full AIC server reboot only). 
During the meeting on 9/17: all STealthAUDIT jobs were disabled, as well as AIC serices were stopped. However, after the SQL server rebooting the CPU usage was 100% again with many SELECT statements from the AIC server (the customer has AIC installed on a server separate from SA).  
Also during the meeting we encountered the Carbon Black AV installed. The customer was advised to test the SQL server CPU   usage with AV disabled - as the customer updated that didn't help. 

The screenshots of CPU usage on SQL server, aic.log, service.log, screenshot of top 10 CPU consuming sql statements, msinfo32 for SQL server, the screenshot of the most CPU consuming sql statement are added to SP","0054u000008AYYTAA4","2024-09-18T04:01:50.000Z","2024-09-18T04:11:01.000Z","false","false"
