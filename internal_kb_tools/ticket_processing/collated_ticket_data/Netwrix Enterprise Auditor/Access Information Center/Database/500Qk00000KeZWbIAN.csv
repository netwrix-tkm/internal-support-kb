"500Qk00000KeZWbIAN","00432286","Support Ticket","AIC Unable to use SQL DB","Between all of the support tickets I've had recently, we've made a lot of StealthAudit database changes.  Today I am unable to login/use AIC.  I will attach the AIC tables I have in my database currently.  I have a backup dated Jan 6th but honestly I'm not sure if AIC was working at that time or not.  I think I logged in on Jan 7th, but can't be sure.

00431040 Database - old data cleanup
100s of tables removed (I think on the 8th), but I swear we opened AIC and it did not have a SQL error showing after our work","","some AIC tables were dropped as part of another ticket's clean up

client has backup from week ago

was able to restore AIC tables from backup

After restoring the tables the client notices duplicate entries for resource owners. One of each duplicate is greyed out and unable to be removed.

Planned to meet to investigate this, however, in the meantime, the AuditEvents table went missing again

I don't understand what would delete the table.
can no longer login to the AIC. The original error is back:
""Unable to use the SQL Server Database provided""

Compairing the screenshot provided of the AIC tables with my Lab, only the SA_AIC_AuditEvents table is missing


you can see in the logs that she logged in successfully on 01/23 then on 01/24, it throws the error
