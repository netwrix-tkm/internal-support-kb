This was created as a Critical ticket. As discussed previously, there is a dependency for Critical issues (Production down) to be responded within 2 hours.

As this has been rescheduled a few times and now is sitting at next week (16th July), it appears this is no longer Critical - Can you confirm?

Hi Alex,
This is critical however per Tay's response:
""Typically, when we see this issue it is caused by the AIC service account credentials changing. To fix this, the AIC will need to be uninstalled and reinstalled (this won't affect any data in the database).""
we must get leadership approval before making any changes in production. This takes several days due to the process (open a change order, pass a change review board, etc). As part of an internal project our direct access was removed and we now require to alter our admin accounts to have DB_owner. For this we must request an exception.
I will request my direct leader to approve the change directly and we are working on expediting the exception.

I appreciate these are circumstances at our end so if it works better for your team to downgrade to, 'High' please do so.

Thank you,
Alison.

Thank you for the clarification.

Given the description this fits with our definition of high severity

https://www.netwrix.com/download/documents/Netwrix_Customer_Support_Program_Guide.pdf

High severity:
Serious Business Impact - means that the Software is operational, but its functionality is seriously affected, and implementing a Workaround is time consuming and will adversely affect Licensee’s business. In addition, Error may involve downtime, outage, serious performance degradation or other failure of one or more noncritical business systems, functions or services that adversely affects the ability of multiple end users to perform their functions.

We need to double check with your firewall team so those ports are opened. If your database is using a different ports for communication please clarify it with your SQL team.

It could be checked under this setting:



Once ports status is clarified, please run a connectivity check, you can use .udl files we've created during troubleshooting session.

I am reassigning this ticket to Aleksandr Timofeev as this ticket wasn't escalated to T2 yet.

Hey Team,

Since you weren't able to join the call, here is a scheduling link to book a time that works best for you to correct this issue:
https://nwxcorp.my.salesforce-sites.com/cts?Id=fJhb9rMP0wuMPGFjAQWAFZ2Pspfs9lOU17D8UIm8GTg-Z&MeetingID=rmFSA1x5ESic5yCNvTu3.E5e7VILXn8G6VWg_tEn6Zw-Z

Typically, when we see this issue it is caused by the AIC service account credentials changing. To fix this, the AIC will need to be uninstalled and reinstalled (this won't affect any data in the database).

Thank you,

Tay Caliguiri

Are there any updates since the last email?

Hi Alison, thank you for your time on call today, we were able to login into AIC using builtin admin account, database communication couldn't be established however, we've tried to change service account that AIC service was using but couldn't connect either, upon further investigation we've discovered that MSSQL ports 1433 and 1434 were not reachable. We need to double check with your firewall team so those ports are opened. If your database is using a different ports for communication please clarify it with your SQL team.

It could be checked under this setting:



Once ports status is clarified, please run a connectivity check, you can use .udl files we've created during troubleshooting session.

I am reassigning this ticket to Aleksandr Timofeev as this ticket wasn't escalated to T2 yet.

Best Regards,
Damir Akhmatshin
Support Engineer EMEA

Hi Alison

Thank you for the clarification.

Given the description this fits with our definition of high severity

https://www.netwrix.com/download/documents/Netwrix_Customer_Support_Program_Guide.pdf

High severity:
Serious Business Impact - means that the Software is operational, but its functionality is seriously affected, and implementing a Workaround is time consuming and will adversely affect Licensee’s business. In addition, Error may involve downtime, outage, serious performance degradation or other failure of one or more noncritical business systems, functions or services that adversely affects the ability of multiple end users to perform their functions.


Best regards,

Alex Buchta

Hi Alex,

This is critical however per Tay’s response:

“Typically, when we see this issue it is caused by the AIC service account credentials changing. To fix this, the AIC will need to be uninstalled and reinstalled (this won't affect any data in the database).”

we must get leadership approval before making any changes in production. This takes several days due to the process (open a change order, pass a change review board, etc). As part of an internal project our direct access was removed and we now require to alter our admin accounts to have DB_owner. For this we must request an exception. 

I will request my direct leader to approve the change directly and we are working on expediting the exception. 

 

I appreciate these are circumstances at our end so if it works better for your team to downgrade to, ‘High’ please do so. 

 

Thank you,

Alison.

Hi All

This was created as a Critical ticket. As discussed previously, there is a dependency for Critical issues (Production down) to be responded within 2 hours.

As this has been rescheduled a few times and now is sitting at next week (16th July), it appears this is no longer Critical - Can you confirm?

Best regards,
