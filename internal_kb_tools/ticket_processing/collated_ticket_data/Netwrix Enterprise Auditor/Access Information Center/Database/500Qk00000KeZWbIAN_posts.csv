Today I am unable to login/use AIC.  I will attach the AIC tables I have in my database currently.  I have a backup dated Jan 6th but honestly I'm not sure if AIC was working at that time or not.  I think I logged in on Jan 7th, but can't be sure.

00431040 Database - old data cleanup
100s of tables removed (I think on the 8th), but I swear we opened AIC and it did not have a SQL error showing after our work","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-15T16:53:06.000Z"
