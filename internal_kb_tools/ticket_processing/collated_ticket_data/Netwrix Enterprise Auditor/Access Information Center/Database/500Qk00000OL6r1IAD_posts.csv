--------
The customer changed the server to use HTTPS and port 481, the link on the desktop was using default http:81
It was also noticed that upon trying to access the login, it was failing to resolve the netbios name of the domain and the service doesn't appear to be getting responses from the SQL server.","","","","005Qk000002AJWTIA4","2025-04-24T19:25:32.000Z"
