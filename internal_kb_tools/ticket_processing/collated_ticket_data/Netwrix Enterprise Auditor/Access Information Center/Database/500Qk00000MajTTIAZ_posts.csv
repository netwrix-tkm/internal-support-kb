I get the same sort of DB errors we saw before in 00432286. The GUI says, There was an error saving your changes.

On 3/3 in the attached log:
Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'ID', table '<a href='https://StealthAudit.dbo' target='_blank'>StealthAudit.dbo</a>.SA_AIC_Resources'; column does not allow nulls. INSERT fails.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-05T17:40:51.000Z"

A similar error is now happening with ""SA_AIC_ResourceReviews"" - it appears that the AIC tables are missing identity columns, which is likely causing these errors, and may arise with other tables after this one is addressed.","","","","0054u000007MiY9AAK","2025-03-28T20:38:41.000Z"
