"500Qk00000L7hAfIAJ","00433716","Support Ticket","AIC cannot connect to SQL database","We are testing changing the password to the DEV StealthAudit SQL account.   
- StealthAudit v11.5 can successfully connect to the SQL db after password change

ISSUE - the web AIC cannot connect to the SQL database.  It prompts for credentials but nothing works.  Can't find any document that explains the fix.","","+++++
StealthAudit v11.5
Goal or task: Reset the SQL Server password in StealthAUDIT and AIC
+++++
 
1) You change the password in NEA (new DB password) to access the NEA (StealthAudit) database. 
2) We used the default ""admin"" user and password to log into AIC.
3) You navigated to ""Configure Console"" and ""Database"" and typed in your new DB password for your SQL account.
4) Now AIC is working again.
5) Note: Other users (other than the ""admin"" user) with the correct password, it seems as though they cannot access AIC when the DB password is not current.
6) At this point in time it is a best practice to login as the ""admin"" user in order to set a new DB password.
