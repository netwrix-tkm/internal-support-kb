Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.
I understand you said servers scanned successfully, but did you notice a successful Import after the scan?
Please verify that the FSAA Bulk Import runs successfully as well. You can let me know if there are any errors and what the error is if there is an error.
 
Thanks,

Thank you for your time today.
In today's meeting, I reviewed the log and noticed the error, but there were not enough details to give us an idea of what could cause the issue. It appears that the scan timeout when scanning this specific server skips to the next one.
We set the job to Debug. After the next run, you will collect the log and upload the Debug log to this ticket so that I can review it further.
You can reply to this email to let me know if you have any questions.

I reviewed the log, but it is the same, as the proxy is not running or the port is blocked.
How many proxies are you using?
We need to verify the proxy is running, and the port is open.
