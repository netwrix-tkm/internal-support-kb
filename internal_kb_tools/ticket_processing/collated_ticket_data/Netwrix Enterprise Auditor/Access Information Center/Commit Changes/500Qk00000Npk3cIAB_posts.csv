We then rebooted the proxy server and port 8766 immediately started working again. The customer indicated that this issue happens daily and so I provided the following troubleshooting steps as I suspect the proxy service isn&#39;t responding, or the port bindings are somehow failing so restarting the proxy server service should start communication again. I don&#39;t think this will fix the customer problem, but it should point us to where the issue is coming from.</p><p> </p><p>1. On the proxy server run<b> netstat -aof | findstr :8766 </b>and let us know what the output is.</p><p> 2. On the NAA server, run <b>tnc -computername &lt;proxyserverIP&gt; -port 8766 </b>and provide the output.</p><p> 3. Restart the proxy service on the proxy server.</p><p> 4.
