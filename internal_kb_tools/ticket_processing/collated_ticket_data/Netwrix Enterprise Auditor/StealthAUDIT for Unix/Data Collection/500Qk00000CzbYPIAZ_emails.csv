Thank you for reaching out to support. 

To update/confirm our Technical Support Notes & start the investigation, could we get the text output (copy&past) from the following ADMIN PowerShell ISE script block on the systems that are running Netwrix/Stealth Server applications?

Clear-Host  # Clears the console window for better readability. 
#Netwrix/Stealth, PostgreSQL, Python application versions:
Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Product |
Where-Object {($_.Name -Like ""Stealth*"" -or $_.Name -like ""Netwrix*"" -or $_.Name -like ""*Postg*"" -or ` $_.Name -like ""Python*"")} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
Sort-Object | Format-Table Name,Version,InstallDate -AutoSize 

Please note that Cohesity is not officially supported so this may be a limitation of the scan.

Are there Errors on the job in question?
If so could we get an Export of the job as well as a CSV export of the Jobs messages?
Ref-images if needed
 




The Zipped files can be uploaded directly to the case once logged into the following site expand the ticket number there, we will see an Attachment option.

Per our call today we confirmed that the current version of Stealth application(s) running in the Environment:

Netwrix Enterprise Auditor (NEA)              11.6.0.76  

We noted that the Platform in question is still not fully supported, which is most likely part of the issue not seeing the other Alias that all point to the same “Filer” host.

Looked at Netwrix StealthAUDlT v11.5 > Administration > Data Collectors > FileSystemAccess Data Collector > FSAA Query Configuration > FSAA: Scoping Options
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/StealthAUDIT_11.5/page/Content/StealthAUDIT/Data_Collectors/FileSystemAccess_Data_Collector/FSAA_Query_Configuration/Scoping_Options.htm

I’m very interested in what Cohesity has to offer on the issue.

Thank You for your time.
