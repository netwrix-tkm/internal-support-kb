Thank You for the update.

Was this a custom Job?

It does not match the default Jobs > Unix > 2.Privileged Access > Sudoers > UX_Sudoers which would have collected data from Jobs  > Unix > 2.Privileged Access > Sudoers > UX_Sudoers

@Gabby if this was a ProServ custom job do you know whom worked its creation for them?

Again, thank You for your time.

This was not a Proserv job, but it could be a custom job. William Larvry (sp?) created this for us when we purchased StealthAudit way back when we first got it for the Linux module.

Bobby,

Thank You for the update.

Was this a custom Job?

It does not match the default Jobs > Unix > 2.Privileged Access > Sudoers > UX_Sudoers which would have collected data from Jobs  > Unix > 2.Privileged Access > Sudoers > UX_Sudoers

@Gabby if this was a ProServ custom job do you know whom worked its creation for them?

Again, thank You for your time.

This was not a Proserv job, but it could be a custom job. William Larvry (sp?) created this for us when we purchased StealthAudit way back when we first got it for the Linux module.

Bobby,

Thank You for the update.

Was this a custom Job?

It does not match the default Jobs > Unix > 2.Privileged Access > Sudoers > UX_Sudoers which would have collected data from Jobs  > Unix > 2.Privileged Access > Sudoers > UX_Sudoers

@Gabby if this was a ProServ custom job do you know whom worked its creation for them?

Again, thank You for your time.

I have added Gabby Davidson to the email as she would be able to answer this question better than me.
