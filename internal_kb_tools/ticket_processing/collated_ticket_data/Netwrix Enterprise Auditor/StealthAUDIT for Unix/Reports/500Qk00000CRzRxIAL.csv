"500Qk00000CRzRxIAL","00413502","Support Ticket","Linux sudoers report is truncating data for column: GROUPMEMBERS to fit the database field","When looking at the Sudoers Job, this is a message we are receiving: Data for column: GROUPMEMBERS was truncated to fit in database field. How do we make it so the data for column GROUPMEMBERS is not being Truncated? We are using this report and supplying it auditors and the column GROUPMEMBERS is the most important information to show (users who are actually in that group) and its being truncated so we cannot show all the data to our auditors.

Also is there a way to remove certain hosts from the Linux Job that runs? We have two Linux collectors, one that is pointed at a specific list of linux servers and the other is pointed at IP ranges, for the collection that is pointed at the IP ranges, can a filter or field be added to ignore/remove any results that has AD.CDC.NICUSA.COM and only keep results that has CDC.NICUSA.COM?","","","","Contact resolved. By upping the char value from 250 to 400, the report is no longer being truncated.","Incorrect configuration: Netwrix product","Dusty Grayson","","Netwrix Enterprise Auditor","StealthAUDIT for Unix","Reports","11.5","160","10.7","Closed - Resolved","NIC Inc","Bobby WIlliams","2024-06-28T21:41:19.000Z","2024-07-09T14:03:59.000Z"
