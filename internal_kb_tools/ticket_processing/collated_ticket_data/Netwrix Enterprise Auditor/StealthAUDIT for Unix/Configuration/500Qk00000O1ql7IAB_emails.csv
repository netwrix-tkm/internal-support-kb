Thank you. We can provide you with instructions (our HelpCenter articles) on how to set up the scan and will assist you with troubleshooting any issues you might encounter during that.

You need to set up the account for us to proceed, as we will use it on a meeting and it has to have Root permissions in Unix/Linux. If the Root permission is unavailable, a least privileged model can be used. See the Least Privilege Model topic additional information.

Once done we can set up a meeting to review everything together.

Thank you for your time today. On this meeting we discovered by checking connectstatus and error messages that your servers display 'Access Denied'. It is caused by the wrong account permissions. Since you want tot implement the Least Privilege Model, here are the instructions for your Linux Admin Team to set those up for the account you're suing to scan: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/Unix.htm#least_privilege_model

Please note that all requirements for Least Privilege Model in this article are hard requirements and cannot be skipped or omitted.

After you're done setting up the account, try scanning again.

Rajesh,

Thank you. We can provide you with instructions (our HelpCenter articles) on how to set up the scan and will assist you with troubleshooting any issues you might encounter during that.

You need to set up the account for us to proceed, as we will use it on a meeting and it has to have Root permissions in Unix/Linux. If the Root permission is unavailable, a least privileged model can be used. See the Least Privilege Model topic additional information.

Once done we can set up a meeting to review everything together.

Since you want tot implement the Least Privilege Model, here are the instructions for your Linux Admin Team to set those up for the account you're suing to scan: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/Unix.htm#least_privilege_model

Please note that all requirements for Least Privilege Model in this article are hard requirements and cannot be skipped or omitted.

After you're done setting up the account, try scanning again.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Rajesh,

Thank you. We can provide you with instructions (our HelpCenter articles) on how to set up the scan and will assist you with troubleshooting any issues you might encounter during that.

You need to set up the account for us to proceed, as we will use it on a meeting and it has to have Root permissions in Unix/Linux. If the Root permission is unavailable, a least privileged model can be used. See the Least Privilege Model<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/Unix.htm#Least> topic additional information.

Once done we can set up a meeting to review everything together.

Rajesh,

Thank you for your time today. On this meeting we discovered by checking connectstatus and error messages that your servers display 'Access Denied'. It is caused by the wrong account permissions. Since you want tot implement the Least Privilege Model, here are the instructions for your Linux Admin Team to set those up for the account you're suing to scan: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/Unix.htm#least_privilege_model

Please note that all requirements for Least Privilege Model in this article are hard requirements and cannot be skipped or omitted.

After you're done setting up the account, try scanning again.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Rajesh,

Thank you. We can provide you with instructions (our HelpCenter articles) on how to set up the scan and will assist you with troubleshooting any issues you might encounter during that.

You need to set up the account for us to proceed, as we will use it on a meeting and it has to have Root permissions in Unix/Linux. If the Root permission is unavailable, a least privileged model can be used. See the Least Privilege Model topic additional information.

Once done we can set up a meeting to review everything together.

Rajesh,

For us to have a productive meeting let's address some question first, to make sure we are on the same page about what needs to be done.

Is this a newly purchased module (for Unix systems) or you have owned it for a while and trying to set it up just now?
What part of the software you want to use with your Unix (Activity Monitor, Netwrix Enterprise Auditor)?
What is your preferred time zone for meetings/communication?
What steps did you already try in setting up audit for your Unix systems?

Rajesh,

For us to have a productive meeting let's address some question first, to make sure we are on the same page about what needs to be done.

Is this a newly purchased module (for Unix systems) or you have owned it for a while and trying to set it up just now?
What part of the software you want to use with your Unix (Activity Monitor, Netwrix Enterprise Auditor)?
What is your preferred time zone for meetings/communication?
What steps did you already try in setting up audit for your Unix systems?

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
Technical Support Engineer

Rajesh,

Thank you for your time today. On this meeting we discovered by checking connectstatus and error messages that your servers display 'Access Denied'. It is caused by the wrong account permissions. Since you want tot implement the Least Privilege Model, here are the instructions for your Linux Admin Team to set those up for the account you're suing to scan: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/Unix.htm#least_privilege_model

Please note that all requirements for Least Privilege Model in this article are hard requirements and cannot be skipped or omitted.

After you're done setting up the account, try scanning again.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Rajesh,

Thank you. We can provide you with instructions (our HelpCenter articles) on how to set up the scan and will assist you with troubleshooting any issues you might encounter during that.

You need to set up the account for us to proceed, as we will use it on a meeting and it has to have Root permissions in Unix/Linux. If the Root permission is unavailable, a least privileged model can be used. See the Least Privilege Model topic additional information.

Once done we can set up a meeting to review everything together.

Rajesh,

Thank you for your time today. On this meeting we discovered by checking connectstatus and error messages that your servers display 'Access Denied'. It is caused by the wrong account permissions. Since you want tot implement the Least Privilege Model, here are the instructions for your Linux Admin Team to set those up for the account you're suing to scan: https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/Unix.htm#least_privilege_model

Please note that all requirements for Least Privilege Model in this article are hard requirements and cannot be skipped or omitted.

After you're done setting up the account, try scanning again.

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov

Thank you. We can provide you with instructions (our HelpCenter articles) on how to set up the scan and will assist you with troubleshooting any issues you might encounter during that.

You need to set up the account for us to proceed, as we will use it on a meeting and it has to have Root permissions in Unix/Linux. If the Root permission is unavailable, a least privileged model can be used. See the Least Privilege Model<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/EnterpriseAuditor_11.6/page/Content/EnterpriseAuditor/Requirements/Target/Unix.htm#Least> topic additional information.

Rajesh,

For us to have a productive meeting let's address some question first, to make sure we are on the same page about what needs to be done.

Is this a newly purchased module (for Unix systems) or you have owned it for a while and trying to set it up just now?
What part of the software you want to use with your Unix (Activity Monitor, Netwrix Enterprise Auditor)?
What is your preferred time zone for meetings/communication?
What steps did you already try in setting up audit for your Unix systems?

Rajesh,

For us to have a productive meeting let's address some question first, to make sure we are on the same page about what needs to be done.

Is this a newly purchased module (for Unix systems) or you have owned it for a while and trying to set it up just now?
What part of the software you want to use with your Unix (Activity Monitor, Netwrix Enterprise Auditor)?
What is your preferred time zone for meetings/communication?
What steps did you already try in setting up audit for your Unix systems?

Best wishes,
Ilya Kotov
