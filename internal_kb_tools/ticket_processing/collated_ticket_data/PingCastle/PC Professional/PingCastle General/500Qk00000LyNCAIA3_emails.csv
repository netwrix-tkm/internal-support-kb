Hi Tim,

Thanks for your update. Since the RODCPurgeAccount operation did not resolve the issue, there are a few additional steps that may help:

Check if the account is still in use – If the account is still being referenced, it may prevent removal.

	Use repadmin to manually clear cached credentials:

repadmin /prp remove <RODC_Name> <Account_Name>


	Use Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache to remove stored credentials:

Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache -Identity <RODC_Name>

Rebuilding the RODC – If the above steps do not work, Microsoft's official recommendation remains to rebuild the RODC to ensure proper removal.

Let us know if you need further guidance.

Dear Tim,

To proceed with the RODC account removal, you will need to purge the account as well.

While Microsoft's official recommendation remains to rebuild the RODC, you can alternatively use the RODCPurgeAccount operation to remove it.

Here’s the relevant documentation for more details:

RODCPurgeAccount Operation
ADSecurity Guide

Please note that the reset will invalidate the stored credentials, but they may still be cached until you perform the purge operation.

Let me know if you need any further assistance.

Betreff: Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC issue - cant remove user [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0LyNCA:ref ]

Dear Tim,

To proceed with the RODC account removal, you will need to purge the account as well.

While Microsoft's official recommendation remains to rebuild the RODC, you can alternatively use the RODCPurgeAccount operation to remove it.

Here’s the relevant documentation for more details:

RODCPurgeAccount Operation<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/78bca39e-cba0-4127-95fe-7e2afdad0101?redirectedfrom=MSDN__;!!Iy-eiNsJYb8-!UafS6dYunAK5VAGag7OYhAEzBeYApEYMTPShVdV60wm7URIKGrObLOjl_N_hsZKjj60j5RglsrD3FAgKZjQkJGNO$>
ADSecurity Guide<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/adsecurity.org/?p=276__;!!Iy-eiNsJYb8-!UafS6dYunAK5VAGag7OYhAEzBeYApEYMTPShVdV60wm7URIKGrObLOjl_N_hsZKjj60j5RglsrD3FAgKZibL0Gaz$>

Please note that the reset will invalidate the stored credentials, but they may still be cached until you perform the purge operation.

Let me know if you need any further assistance.

Hello Tim,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00436038. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00436038
Ticket Subject: Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC issue - cant remove user
Ticket Details: The following issue persists: despite multiple password resets for the admin account, the user continues to reappear after some time. The RODCPurgeAccount command has been attempted without success.

Rule: Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC

Rule ID: P-RODCAdminRevealed
Description: Verifies whether privileged users have been revealed on a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC).
Technical Explanation:
The RODC tracks revealed users using the msDS-RevealedUsers attribute on its computer object.
If a privileged user appears in this list, their authentication secrets are cached, posing a security risk as they can be used for impersonation.
Steps Taken:

The admin account password has been reset multiple times.
The RODCPurgeAccount command has been executed, but the user reappears after some time.
Request:
Assistance is required to resolve the issue and prevent the admin account from being revealed on the RODC.

Thank you!

Hi Tim,

Thanks for your update. Since the RODCPurgeAccount operation did not resolve the issue, there are a few additional steps that may help:

Check if the account is still in use – If the account is still being referenced, it may prevent removal.


	Use repadmin to manually clear cached credentials:


repadmin /prp remove <RODC_Name> <Account_Name>


	Use Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache to remove stored credentials:


Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache -Identity <RODC_Name>

Rebuilding the RODC – If the above steps do not work, Microsoft's official recommendation remains to rebuild the RODC to ensure proper removal.

Let us know if you need further guidance.

Ticket Number: 00436038

Hi Tim,

Thanks for your update. Since the RODCPurgeAccount operation did not resolve the issue, there are a few additional steps that may help:

Check if the account is still in use – If the account is still being referenced, it may prevent removal.


	Use repadmin to manually clear cached credentials:


repadmin /prp remove <RODC_Name> <Account_Name>


	Use Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache to remove stored credentials:


Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache -Identity <RODC_Name>

Rebuilding the RODC – If the above steps do not work, Microsoft's official recommendation remains to rebuild the RODC to ensure proper removal.

Let us know if you need further guidance.

Dear Tim,

To proceed with the RODC account removal, you will need to purge the account as well.

While Microsoft's official recommendation remains to rebuild the RODC, you can alternatively use the RODCPurgeAccount operation to remove it.

Here’s the relevant documentation for more details:

RODCPurgeAccount Operation
ADSecurity Guide

Please note that the reset will invalidate the stored credentials, but they may still be cached until you perform the purge operation.

Let me know if you need any further assistance.

Hello Tim,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00436038. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00436038
Ticket Subject: Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC issue - cant remove user
Ticket Details: The following issue persists: despite multiple password resets for the admin account, the user continues to reappear after some time. The RODCPurgeAccount command has been attempted without success.

Rule: Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC

Rule ID: P-RODCAdminRevealed
Description: Verifies whether privileged users have been revealed on a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC).
Technical Explanation:
The RODC tracks revealed users using the msDS-RevealedUsers attribute on its computer object.
If a privileged user appears in this list, their authentication secrets are cached, posing a security risk as they can be used for impersonation.
Steps Taken:

The admin account password has been reset multiple times.
The RODCPurgeAccount command has been executed, but the user reappears after some time.
Request:
Assistance is required to resolve the issue and prevent the admin account from being revealed on the RODC.

Thank you!

Hi Tim,

Thanks for your update. Since the RODCPurgeAccount operation did not resolve the issue, there are a few additional steps that may help:

Check if the account is still in use – If the account is still being referenced, it may prevent removal.


	Use repadmin to manually clear cached credentials:


repadmin /prp remove <RODC_Name> <Account_Name>


	Use Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache to remove stored credentials:


Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache -Identity <RODC_Name>

Rebuilding the RODC – If the above steps do not work, Microsoft's official recommendation remains to rebuild the RODC to ensure proper removal.

Let us know if you need further guidance.

Dear Tim,

To proceed with the RODC account removal, you will need to purge the account as well.

While Microsoft's official recommendation remains to rebuild the RODC, you can alternatively use the RODCPurgeAccount operation to remove it.

Here’s the relevant documentation for more details:

RODCPurgeAccount Operation
ADSecurity Guide

Please note that the reset will invalidate the stored credentials, but they may still be cached until you perform the purge operation.

Let me know if you need any further assistance.

Betreff: RE: Netwrix Support Ticket #436038 - - AW: Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC issue - cant remove user [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0LyNCA:ref ]

Hello Tim,

I wanted to check in regarding your support ticket 00436038. We haven’t heard from you in a while, and I just wanted to see if you still need assistance with this issue.

If you’re still experiencing problems or have any updates to share, please let me know. If the issue has been resolved, I can go ahead and close the ticket on my end.

Please feel free to reply to this email with any updates or questions. We’re here to help you get the most out of your Netwrix products.

Ticket Number: 00436038
Ticket Subject: Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC issue - cant remove user
Ticket Details: The following issue persists: despite multiple password resets for the admin account, the user continues to reappear after some time. The RODCPurgeAccount command has been attempted without success.

Rule: Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC

Rule ID: P-RODCAdminRevealed
Description: Verifies whether privileged users have been revealed on a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC).
Technical Explanation:
The RODC tracks revealed users using the msDS-RevealedUsers attribute on its computer object.
If a privileged user appears in this list, their authentication secrets are cached, posing a security risk as they can be used for impersonation.
Steps Taken:

The admin account password has been reset multiple times.
The RODCPurgeAccount command has been executed, but the user reappears after some time.
Request:
Assistance is required to resolve the issue and prevent the admin account from being revealed on the RODC.

Thank you!

Hi Tim,

Thanks for your update. Since the RODCPurgeAccount operation did not resolve the issue, there are a few additional steps that may help:

Check if the account is still in use – If the account is still being referenced, it may prevent removal.

  1.  Use repadmin to manually clear cached credentials:
repadmin /prp remove <RODC_Name> <Account_Name>

  1.  Use Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache to remove stored credentials:
Clear-ADAccountPasswordCache -Identity <RODC_Name>

Rebuilding the RODC – If the above steps do not work, Microsoft's official recommendation remains to rebuild the RODC to ensure proper removal.

Let us know if you need further guidance.

Betreff: Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC issue - cant remove user [ ref:!00D70091pB.!500Qk0LyNCA:ref ]

Dear Tim,

To proceed with the RODC account removal, you will need to purge the account as well.

While Microsoft's official recommendation remains to rebuild the RODC, you can alternatively use the RODCPurgeAccount operation to remove it.

Here’s the relevant documentation for more details:

RODCPurgeAccount Operation<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/78bca39e-cba0-4127-95fe-7e2afdad0101?redirectedfrom=MSDN__;!!Iy-eiNsJYb8-!UafS6dYunAK5VAGag7OYhAEzBeYApEYMTPShVdV60wm7URIKGrObLOjl_N_hsZKjj60j5RglsrD3FAgKZjQkJGNO$>
ADSecurity Guide<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/adsecurity.org/?p=276__;!!Iy-eiNsJYb8-!UafS6dYunAK5VAGag7OYhAEzBeYApEYMTPShVdV60wm7URIKGrObLOjl_N_hsZKjj60j5RglsrD3FAgKZibL0Gaz$>

Please note that the reset will invalidate the stored credentials, but they may still be cached until you perform the purge operation.

Let me know if you need any further assistance.
