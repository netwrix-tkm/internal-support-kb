I have sent the e-mail today to Vincent asking his availability, I asked the client as well but she responded only indicating this day at 14pm. Anyway the meeting should be organized and I think the engineer who is managing this case should also present on the call to see how the problem is going to be resolved. </p>","","","","0050g000006HYRTAA4","2024-11-11T12:16:53.000Z"
