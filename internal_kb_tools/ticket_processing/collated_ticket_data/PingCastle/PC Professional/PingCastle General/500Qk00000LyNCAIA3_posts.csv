we canÂ´t get rid of the following. The admin already changed his password, even more than once. Could you help us?
We already tried to use the RODCPurge Account, but anyway - no luck. The user will show up after a while.

Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC
Rule ID:
P-RODCAdminRevealed
Description:
The purpose is to check if privileged users have already been revealed
Technical explanation:
On Active Directory, all users revealed to a RODC are tracked by an attribute set on the computer object of the RODC named msDS-RevealedUsers.
The program checks on the list of revealed users if one of them is known as a privileged user.
Indeed, the RODC is caching the authentication secrets related of this user, which can then be used to impersonate it.
In addition to that, RODC are placed in general on more riskier environment.
Advised solution:
The admin account should have its secrets change (a password reset) and be sure that the account will not be revealed anymore.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-17T12:41:24.000Z"

The RODCPurgeAccount command has been attempted without success.

Rule: Check if privileged users have been revealed on RODC

Rule ID: P-RODCAdminRevealed
Description: Verifies whether privileged users have been revealed on a Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC).
Technical Explanation:
The RODC tracks revealed users using the msDS-RevealedUsers attribute on its computer object.
If a privileged user appears in this list, their authentication secrets are cached, posing a security risk as they can be used for impersonation.
Steps Taken:

The admin account password has been reset multiple times.
The RODCPurgeAccount command has been executed, but the user reappears after some time.
Request:
Assistance is required to resolve the issue and prevent the admin account from being revealed on the RODC.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-02-25T06:50:26.000Z"
