I'm working for a French company named Socomec.
We purchased Pingcastle Pro licence through a partner, Athéo Ingénierie, but we don't understand how to download the MSI package.
Can you please tell us how to do ? 
Thank you.","","Customer wants to locate installation files for PingCastle","First, i attached the installation file but it doesn't work this way.
