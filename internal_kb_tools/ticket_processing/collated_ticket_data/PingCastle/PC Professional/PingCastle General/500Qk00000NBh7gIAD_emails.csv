Hello Ali,

Thank you for your answer and sorry for my late feedback.

After installing the 3.5 framework everything was working fine.

Can I ask you something else please ? 
I configured the IIS server to use HTTPS secure access but I don't feel at ease with certificates.

When I try to run the command I would like to implement in the scheduler, I have an SSL error : Login failed (The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel.)
I attach screenshot to show you : SSL_error

Do you know which process I could follow to resolve this ? 

Many thanks.","Netwrix Support Ticket #439650 - Error message during database creation","mathieu.biero@atheo.net","Mathieu Biero","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-03-27T11:29:58.000Z","true"

Hello Ali,

It's OK for the SSL I was finally able to resolve it.

Just another and last question.
In the free version I was able to click on the user groups to have the account details and here in the Pro version I'm not able to click to see the details (attachment User group.jpg).

How can I resolve this please ? 

Thank you.
