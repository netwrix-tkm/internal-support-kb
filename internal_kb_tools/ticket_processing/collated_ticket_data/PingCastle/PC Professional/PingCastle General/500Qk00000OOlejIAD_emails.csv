Thanks for contacting Netwrix Support. My name is Shaheryar and I will be assisting you with this ticket. To begin with, we need to make sure that you have all the prerequisite components installed. I am pasting a screenshot of the .NET versions that you need below:



Here is the link of the required .Net hosting bundle: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

FYI: Please make sure you click on the ""Hosting Bundle"" to download the correct bundle



Once you have these installed, please let me know and we can proceed to the next steps.
