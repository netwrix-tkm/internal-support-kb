Hi Rej,

hope you´re fine.

i did like you said. If i generate an ad-hoc Report, it´s says:

Do we need to reevaluate our license?

There is a slight bug with PingCastlePro where the license is applied but when running the report it still says basic edition however when checking the report it shows the full Pro edition. Was the appsettings.production.json file updated with your Pro license?

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Viewed both the old and new directory for PingCastlePro and checked the licensing
Saw that the old version license worked but the new version the license doesn't apply at all


Our next steps are:
Follow up with my team and discuss what the best options are.
Most likely we will provide you with a new license as this is a bug in the current version.

We will let you know as soon as we get an answer

I have attached the new license for you. I have tested it to make sure it works. However it may still say Free Edition when running the report but when uploaded it shows that the license is applied. You can also validate the license if you go into PingCastlePro WebUI and click 'About' at the bottom of the page.

Let me know if you have any other issues.

Thank you for the update. Because you have setup the API correctly, the --api-key will retrieve the license. I believe the licence within appsettings.json file is only for the web interface and not for the PingCastle.exe. The scheduler should work properly because of this. Do you need anything else?
