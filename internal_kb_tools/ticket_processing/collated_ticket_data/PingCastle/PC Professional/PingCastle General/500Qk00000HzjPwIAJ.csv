"500Qk00000HzjPwIAJ","00426337","Support Ticket",".NET 6 out of support 12th November 2024","We have been told by a Netwrix support representative that our version of PingCastle should support a higher version of .NET that version 6. However, after having installed version 8 and removing version 6, the web console just gives us errors that the .NET version is wrong.

Are there specific instructions, or a particular procedure to upgrade to a higher .NET version and subsequently and remove .NET 6, as in five days, this becomes a security failure for us and we'll need to remove or shutdown the product?

Thank you!","","We are aware of the need to upgrade ASP.NET from v6 as it ending the support life on 12/11/24.","Escalating to R&D","Symptom
