"500Qk00000MfRyrIAF","00438034","Support Ticket","Audit Data view missing information","The issue occurs when uploading an XML file for a domain to the PingCastle Pro portal. The audit data view does not show any example findings for each topic, whereas for another domain report does.","Conduct a PingCastle scan 
Upload the resulting XML file to the PingCastle Pro web portal.
View the audit data and confirm that no example findings are displayed for each topic.","Analysis of HTML File:
Upon comparing the free version report’s HTML file and the Pro version’s uploaded audit data, it’s evident that the free version includes more detailed findings and examples. This discrepancy points to the absence of the --full scan parameter as the primary reason why the Pro version’s data view is not populated with example findings.
The --full parameter triggers an in-depth scan that provides the detailed data necessary to display example findings for each topic in the audit data view.","Re-run the PingCastle scan using the --full parameter to ensure all relevant findings are captured.
Upload the new XML file to the PingCastle Pro portal.
Verify that the audit data view now displays the example findings.
Confirm with the user that the expected data is now visible.","The issue was due to the absence of the --full scan parameter when conducting a PingCastle scan.
The user was advised to re-run the scan using the --full parameter to capture all relevant findings.
After uploading the new XML file to the PingCastle Pro portal, the audit data view now displays example findings as expected.
The user has confirmed that the issue is resolved.","Incorrect configuration: target server software","Iulia Apatachioaei","Unexpected Behavior","PingCastle","PC Professional","PingCastle General","3.3","","7.1","Closed - Resolved","CRH","Martin Brooks","2025-03-07T12:10:09.000Z","2025-03-14T13:58:07.000Z"
