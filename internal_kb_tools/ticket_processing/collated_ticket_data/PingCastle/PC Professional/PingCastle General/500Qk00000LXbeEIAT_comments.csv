Investigation into this points to the installer updates and specifically the GrantApplicationPoolAsSql.ps1 step.

The installer is attempting to run PowerShell on it prior to it being in the directory or something. The PingCastle Enterprise installer works without issue.

Here is the log showing the issue.
```

```

I am not sure what the difference between pro and enterprise is here. I can see the steps are in enterprise and then consumed by Pro. I assume something small has been missed with either the wix upgrade or the cherrypick into the releases/release_3.3.0.1 branch?

I have uploaded a process monitor capture and a verbose MSI log of the installer in my lab to the ticket.

Do not worry about the `""Forces installation on E drive""` comment. I did some digging on this and it turns out it is because we dont specifically specify the [ROOTDRIVE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/rootdrive) msi property and without it being specified it just picks the drive with the most space (last paragraph). I have passed this info to support with information on how to specify the ROOTDRIVE and TARGETDIR with MSIEXEC Properties.
