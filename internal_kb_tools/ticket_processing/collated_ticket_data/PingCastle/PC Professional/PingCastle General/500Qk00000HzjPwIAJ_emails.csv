Thanks for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

Unfortunately, a higher version of .NET is not supported at this moment. PingCastle supports ASP.NET 6 hosting bundle and you will need to downgrade to it in the meantime.
We are aware of the need to upgrade that, and the team is working on it, but I can't give you an ETA right now.

Will get you informed about this as soon as we have an update.

Please let me know if you have any question.

Thank you!
Regards,

Emiliano Krai√±uk
Technical Support Engineer
