I found the export button but no way to put all the Rules back in with an upload. 
Is there an easy way to upload the csv file?","","","","Hello Benjamin,

The feature is currently missing and needs to be added to the roadmap.

If you have access to both new and old database this can be done manually but you'd need to plan a call with Mr. Vincent Le TOux, the developer of this product.
The idea is to generate a sql script that will apply the changes to the database.","","Elizaveta Presniakova","","PingCastle","PC Professional","PingCastle General","3.2.0.1","","34.8","Closed - Resolved","Helios-gesundheit","Benjamin Steil","2024-08-07T12:16:07.000Z","2024-09-11T08:32:22.000Z"
