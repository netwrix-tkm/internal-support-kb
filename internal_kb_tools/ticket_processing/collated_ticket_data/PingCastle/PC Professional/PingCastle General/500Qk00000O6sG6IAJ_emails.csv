Hello Rej

Thanks for you quick reply. I have just created the account because I was looking for the installation files.

I can now see Netwrix Pingcastle under ""My products"" which I was not seeing before. Did you implement a change, or did I just not wait long enough after creating the account?

Thanks in any case, I can now download the installation files!

Kind regards
