Hello Rej,

Thank's for your reply.
I'm not able to see the MSI file in the attachment field.
Did you add it ? Are you able to send me a download link maybe ?

Apologies, there is another way to get the installation file.

Product downloads are available through our customer portal.

You must be an employee of SOCOMEC and register on Netwrix.com/support in order to access the installation and license files.
