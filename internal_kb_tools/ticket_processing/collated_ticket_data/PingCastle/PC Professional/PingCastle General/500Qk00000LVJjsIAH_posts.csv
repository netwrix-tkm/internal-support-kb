Running Pingcastle against our Azure tenant, when in interactive mode, it pops up the authentication dialog (which is blank) and eventually fails.
when trying to use command line, specifying tenantID etc, it still brings up interactive mode, which then has the same issue with the blank authentication dialog (pingcastle cloud title).
Any thoughts please?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-05T16:37:14.000Z"

Troubleshooting Steps Taken:

Attempted interactive mode: Authentication dialog appears blank and eventually fails.
Tried command-line mode with TenantID specified: Still triggers interactive mode, resulting in the same blank authentication dialog (PingCastle Cloud title).","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-02-05T17:34:12.000Z"
