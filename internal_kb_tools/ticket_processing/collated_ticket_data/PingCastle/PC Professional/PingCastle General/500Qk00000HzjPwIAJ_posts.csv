However, after having installed version 8 and removing version 6, the web console just gives us errors that the .NET version is wrong.

Are there specific instructions, or a particular procedure to upgrade to a higher .NET version and subsequently and remove .NET 6, as in five days, this becomes a security failure for us and we'll need to remove or shutdown the product?

Thank you!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-07T09:49:34.000Z"
