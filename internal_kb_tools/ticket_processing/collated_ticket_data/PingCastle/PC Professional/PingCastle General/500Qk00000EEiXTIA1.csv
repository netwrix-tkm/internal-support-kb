"500Qk00000EEiXTIA1","00417708","Support Ticket","Adding A New Domain","I'm trying to schedule a scan of our Entra (AAD) environment.  Even though I’ve imported the json report for a locally generated Entra scan it still doesn’t show up in the Scheduler dropdown menu under domains when I try to create a new one.  Only our local AD domain shows up.  It does however show up on the “List Of All Domains” main page.

How do I add it to the scheduler?

Thanks,
Joe","","","","Issue
