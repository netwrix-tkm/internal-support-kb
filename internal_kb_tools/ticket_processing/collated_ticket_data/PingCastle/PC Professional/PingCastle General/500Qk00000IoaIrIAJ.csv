Good Day!

We would like to ask how PingCastle detects obsolete version of Windows? Is there a database of all Windows version which the tool checks? Or do you have an official Microsoft article where you base the obsolete versions?

Thanks!","","PingCastle uses the Microsoft docs that contains the EoS,and then include a check in the reports.","Close the case as customer is ok with it.","Symptom
