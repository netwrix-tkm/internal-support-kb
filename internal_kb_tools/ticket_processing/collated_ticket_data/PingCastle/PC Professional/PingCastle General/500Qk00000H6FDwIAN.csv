Good Day!

We would like to ask on how can we receive alert notification related:

- PingCastle version updates (e.g. EOL, Production stable version...)
- PingCastle vulnerabilities and recommended solutions
- PingCastle issues and resolutions

This is for us to avoid what happened when our product version is already out of support thus our it stopped working.

Thanks!","","","","QUESTION: Same as described.

ANSWER: Please note that security notifications regarding vulnerabilities are communicated to all affected customers but customers can login to https://security.netwrix.com/Account/SignIn to get more information.
 
However, for staying up to date you can also register on GitHub and watch the PingCastle github.

We haven't released a new version of PingCastle Professional yet. New release is currently scheduled for 30th October but is subject to change.

The sender's name depends on the content of the email. If it contains marketing material, it will be sent from someone in the Marketing team, if it's from Sales, a salesperson's name would be on it.","","Ali Asif","","PingCastle","PC Professional","PingCastle General","3.2.0.1","","1.2","Closed - Resolved","Exide Technologies SAS","Rhondel Herrera","2024-10-16T11:23:00.000Z","2024-10-17T15:41:34.000Z"
