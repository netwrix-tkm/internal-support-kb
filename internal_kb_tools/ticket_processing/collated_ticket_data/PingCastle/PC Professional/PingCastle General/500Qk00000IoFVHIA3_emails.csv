Hello Rhondel,

Thanks for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

The option you have in PingCastle Pro is to archive, which keeps the data but does not allow you to keep updating it (it claims back a license for the domain).

For example. if you have two domains you will see this screen

Can you resend this screenshot before closing the ticket? Not sure if the one I saw was the correct one:

This is the settings I found in the console:

Hi Rhondel,

I'm checking internally and there is no option to remove like 1 random/specific report in the list of reports.
You can delete an entire domain in Enterprise version but that's it, nothing for specific reports.

I can add that as a feature request if you agree, so the devs can work on adding that option in a future release.

Please let me know if you have any question.

Hi Rhondel,


I was checking internally and there is an option to remove old data from the console.
It's located in Configuration -> Settings. And it must be above 3 months.

Good Day!

We have below option:

[cid:5fd69bb5-0795-4551-aa12-5c5570cc72d3@Image_0_]

What will happen if I click Archive? Will it archive all the reports listed here:

Our plan is to only delete some old reports.

Hello Rhondel,

Thanks for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

The option you have in PingCastle Pro is to archive, which keeps the data but does not allow you to keep updating it (it claims back a license for the domain).

For example. if you have two domains you will see this screen

Clicking into a domain you should see the archive option

Hi, Thanks for the feedback. Once we configure this one and set 120 days, what will happen to the report history? Will it remove all the old report and will only retain 3 months report? So we will only see reports from November (latest) and August (oldest)?

Hi Rhondel,


I was checking internally and there is an option to remove old data from the console.
It's located in Configuration -> Settings. And it must be above 3 months.

Hi Emiliano,

Good Day!

We have below option:

[cid:3c9539dd-4f14-47ba-ba2a-df0d0e206eec@Image_3_]

What will happen if I click Archive? Will it archive all the reports listed here:

[cid:ac64c01e-042c-4480-a456-e08b9d9b9d87@Image_4_]

Our plan is to only delete some old reports.

Let us know if this can be achieve in our current version.

Thanks!

Hello Rhondel,

Thanks for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

The option you have in PingCastle Pro is to archive, which keeps the data but does not allow you to keep updating it (it claims back a license for the domain).

For example. if you have two domains you will see this screen

Clicking into a domain you should see the archive option

Please let me know if you have any question.

Thank you!

The 3 months is the minimum for this, if you set the option to 120 days, it will retain 120 days of data.
It will keep the reports, but it will remove the data older than 120 days from those reports.

I know that probably is not exactly what you are trying to do, but at least you will not retain older data on those reports.

In case that you really need to delete all this information and the reports, it could be possible through the Database, but in that case I will need some time to check internally how we can do that so we are sure we are not breaking any other thing.

Please let me know if you have any question.

Hi, Thanks for the feedback. Once we configure this one and set 120 days, what will happen to the report history? Will it remove all the old report and will only retain 3 months report? So we will only see reports from November (latest) and August (oldest)?

Hi Rhondel,

I'm checking internally and there is no option to remove like 1 random/specific report in the list of reports.
You can delete an entire domain in Enterprise version but that's it, nothing for specific reports.

I can add that as a feature request if you agree, so the devs can work on adding that option in a future release.

Ok. So for below report history, we will only see here data from August 2024 - November 2024 once we set 120days? But on the database, the old reports are still there? If we want to have it appear again in the portal, we will need to remove the 120days settings? Is this how it works?

Hi Rhondel,


I was checking internally and there is an option to remove old data from the console.
It's located in Configuration -> Settings. And it must be above 3 months.

Hi Emiliano,

Good Day!

We have below option:

[cid:3d2fd2e1-eb04-46b7-8db1-c4473c0d0ca4@Image_3_]

What will happen if I click Archive? Will it archive all the reports listed here:

[cid:5d2f2893-9487-4c49-9aa7-4fe3dc373d62@Image_4_]

Our plan is to only delete some old reports.

Let us know if this can be achieve in our current version.

Thanks!

Hello Rhondel,

Thanks for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

The option you have in PingCastle Pro is to archive, which keeps the data but does not allow you to keep updating it (it claims back a license for the domain).

For example. if you have two domains you will see this screen

[image]

Clicking into a domain you should see the archive option

Please let me know if you have any question.

Thank you!

The report will still be there, but it will not show data older than 120 days, exactly. 
The old data will be removed also from the database, you will not be able to see it again if you remove the setting because the data will be deleted.

What I was mentioning about the databases, was that if you want to delete the entire report, that should be done in a database level.

Please let me know if you have any question.

Ok. So for below report history, we will only see here data from August 2024 - November 2024 once we set 120days? But on the database, the old reports are still there? If we want to have it appear again in the portal, we will need to remove the 120days settings? Is this how it works?

Hi Rhondel,

The 3 months is the minimum for this, if you set the option to 120 days, it will retain 120 days of data.
It will keep the reports, but it will remove the data older than 120 days from those reports.

I know that probably is not exactly what you are trying to do, but at least you will not retain older data on those reports.

In case that you really need to delete all this information and the reports, it could be possible through the Database, but in that case I will need some time to check internally how we can do that so we are sure we are not breaking any other thing.

Please let me know if you have any question.

Thank you!

Hi, Thanks for the feedback. Once we configure this one and set 120 days, what will happen to the report history? Will it remove all the old report and will only retain 3 months report? So we will only see reports from November (latest) and August (oldest)?

Hi Rhondel,

I'm checking internally and there is no option to remove like 1 random/specific report in the list of reports.
You can delete an entire domain in Enterprise version but that's it, nothing for specific reports.

I can add that as a feature request if you agree, so the devs can work on adding that option in a future release.

Please let me know if you have any question.

Thank you!

Hi, Thanks for the feedback. Once we configure this one and set 120 days, what will happen to the report history? Will it remove all the old report and will only retain 3 months report? So we will only see reports from November (latest) and August (oldest)?

Hi Rhondel,

Sure, here is the screenshot again, but after checking the one you sent, that is the correct one.

Hi Emiliano,

Good Day!

Can you resend this screenshot before closing the ticket? Not sure if the one I saw was the correct one:

[cid:ee6f32f6-9df9-498d-88fd-bae277a629bc@Image_2_]


This is the settings I found in the console:
[cid:01e598d2-c083-4555-97aa-af6ab2ffffd4@Image_3_]

Please advise.

Thanks!

Hi Rhondel,

I'm checking internally and there is no option to remove like 1 random/specific report in the list of reports.
You can delete an entire domain in Enterprise version but that's it, nothing for specific reports.

I can add that as a feature request if you agree, so the devs can work on adding that option in a future release.

Please let me know if you have any question.

Thank you!

Hi Emiliano,

Thanks for the update. We will check with management if this is acceptable to them. The option to remove few reports, which PingCastle version is it available?

Hi Rhondel,


I was checking internally and there is an option to remove old data from the console.
It's located in Configuration -> Settings. And it must be above 3 months.

Hi Emiliano,

Good Day!

We have below option:

[cid:229b96e2-5801-4e92-9897-d889f9239326@Image_4_]

What will happen if I click Archive? Will it archive all the reports listed here:

[cid:560aa288-392b-4861-bfd7-689532736191@Image_5_]

Our plan is to only delete some old reports.

Let us know if this can be achieve in our current version.

Thanks!

Hello Rhondel,

Thanks for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

The option you have in PingCastle Pro is to archive, which keeps the data but does not allow you to keep updating it (it claims back a license for the domain).

For example. if you have two domains you will see this screen

Clicking into a domain you should see the archive option

Please let me know if you have any question.

Thank you!
