We have obtained the XML versions of one of our domain to the PingCastle Pro web portal, and in audit data view it will not show list of example findings for each topic. We will attach the screenshots of free version report and Pro version report. Kindly let us know how to fix this matter?
 
Thanks","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-07T12:10:10.000Z"

Upon comparing the free version report’s HTML file and the Pro version’s uploaded audit data, it’s evident that the free version includes more detailed findings and examples. This discrepancy points to the absence of the --full scan parameter as the primary reason why the Pro version’s data view is not populated with example findings.
The --full parameter triggers an in-depth scan that provides the detailed data necessary to display example findings for each topic in the audit data view.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-03-13T17:21:05.000Z"

Upload the new XML file to the PingCastle Pro portal.
Verify that the audit data view now displays the example findings.
Confirm with the user that the expected data is now visible.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-03-13T17:21:24.000Z"
