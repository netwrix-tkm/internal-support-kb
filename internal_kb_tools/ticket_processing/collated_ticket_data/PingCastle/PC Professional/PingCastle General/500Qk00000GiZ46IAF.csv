Hope you are doing well.

Regarding the P-ProtectedUsers check, would be possible to let me know how it is calculated.
I'm trying to understand it, because in the report output are present users that from my point of view shouldn't be in there.

Thank you very much.

Best regards,

Need to know how the P-ProtectedUsers check works.

Resolution
PingCastle checks all users in privileged groups and checks whether they are in the ""Protected Users"" group.If they are not there, they are shown in the report.","","Emiliano Krainuk","","PingCastle","PC Professional","PingCastle General","3.2.0.1","","0.2","Closed - Resolved","Guerbet","Ciprian Lozonschi","2024-10-07T08:28:07.000Z","2024-10-07T12:14:56.000Z"
