I try to install Pingcastle Pro in our environmetn and i am stuck already :).
I only have the ZIP file to download. When i check the installation for the IIS Website and navigate i only see in the root folder the <a href='https://favicon.ico' target='_blank'>favicon.ico</a> file, no ASPX or HTML files. Is this on porpouse? Also according to the installation instructions I am required to install .net V6. But this goes soon EOL Does it work with .Net 8 as well?","","Customer can download the msi and other files from https://backend.pingcastle.com/Download/AskLicense.
