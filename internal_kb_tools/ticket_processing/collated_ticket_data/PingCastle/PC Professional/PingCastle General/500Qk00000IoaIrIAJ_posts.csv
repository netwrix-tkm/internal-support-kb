Good Day!

We would like to ask how PingCastle detects obsolete version of Windows? Is there a database of all Windows version which the tool checks? Or do you have an official Microsoft article where you base the obsolete versions?

Thanks!","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-26T15:39:41.000Z"
