Hope you are doing well.

We are using Ping Castle, and we have one question related to User Information - Account analysis - Inactive objects (Last usage > 6 months).
Would you be able to let us know how is this calculated, what property of the account is used for it?
In the description I see ""Indicates the number of enabled accounts without any logon during the last 6 months"".

Thank you very much.

Best regards,

Want to know how the User Information - Account analysis - Inactive objects (Last usage > 6 months) is calculated.

LastLogonTimeStamp can be up to around 9-14 days out of date. Microsoft does this to limit replication traffic.
You can check this article explaining that in more details:
