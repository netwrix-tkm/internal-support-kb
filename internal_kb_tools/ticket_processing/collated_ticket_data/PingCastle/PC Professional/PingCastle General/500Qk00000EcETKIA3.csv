I updated PingCastlePro last month using <a href='https://PingCastleProSetup_3.2.1.0.zip' target='_blank'>PingCastleProSetup_3.2.1.0.zip</a> and we have noticed that when running <a href='https://PingCastle.exe' target='_blank'>PingCastle.exe</a> it is showing as the free version and version 3.2.0. This is when we select a domain to investigate and it starts to run.

The .exe when you start it is showing 3.2.1
The portal shows 3.2.1 and our pro license
I've checked ""License"" in <a href='https://appsettings.Production.json' target='_blank'>appsettings.Production.json</a> and can see our license in there.

Could you let me know what the issue is?

Kind regards,

Alex","","","","<LicenseSettings

Updated pingastle.config. file with the license key, all is working.","","Elizaveta Presniakova","","PingCastle","PC Professional","PingCastle General","3.2.0.1","","8.8","Closed - Resolved","wwutilities","Alex Wan","2024-08-19T11:25:24.000Z","2024-08-28T07:13:55.000Z"
