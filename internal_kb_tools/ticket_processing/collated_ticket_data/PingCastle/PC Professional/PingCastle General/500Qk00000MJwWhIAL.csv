Dear Netwrix-Team, 

Semperit AG Holding has concluded a contract for a PingCastle Pro license which has according to your Customer Success Representative Anastasia Shkulepa, renewed on 02/20/2025. However, our license is currently inactive for some reason. Therefore I am trying to contact Anastasia, but I can not seem to reach her. Could you please  contact me urgently in order to activate our license, since the deactivation is causing us heavy disruptions in our projects?

Customer:
Semperit AG Holding
Am Belvedere 10
1100 Vienna
Austria

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
