Hi Emiliano,

Good Day!

Thanks for the feedback. We ask this because in our September review, Windows 11 21H2 was not detected by PingCastle. If my understanding is correct, this was detected because of below advisory and the availability date?

Yes, I understand that part where in the date on the rule was set to October 8, 2024:

[cid:3d792c6b-bf26-4a43-83af-7030fb40c021]

However, where do you base these details?

For example, in Win10 22H2, the settings is below:

[cid:6b756acd-a0a0-4584-898c-a29ef5fc7984]

But where was this based? Looking at the other links you provided e.g. Window 10 release information, it was stated for version Win10 22H2 that the end of servicing is on October 14, 2025 which is not the one configured on the health check rule.

Apologies if we have many questions, but we need to understand this because these are also the questions from the management after we presented the PingCastle report earlier.

Thanks!

No problem at all, I'm here to help you and clarify what you need!

I was checking this internally and we found that originally the end date was May 13th 2025, but now is updated.
You can see that here:
https://web.archive.org/web/20230318221605/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-enterprise-and-education

We logged this as a bug and it will be updated in the next release.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Hi Rhondel,

No problem at all, I'm here to help you and clarify what you need!

I was checking this internally and we found that originally the end date was May 13th 2025, but now is updated.
You can see that here:
https://web.archive.org/web/20230318221605/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-enterprise-and-education

We logged this as a bug and it will be updated in the next release.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Thank you!

Yes, I understand that part where in the date on the rule was set to October 8, 2024:

[cid:d7201263-1ab8-4eba-b93c-6917a3845214@Image_0_]

However, where do you base these details?

For example, in Win10 22H2, the settings is below:

[cid:02ce9e82-84f5-4438-96c3-a19bf8648aaa@Image_1_]

But where was this based? Looking at the other links you provided e.g. Window 10 release information, it was stated for version Win10 22H2 that the end of servicing is on October 14, 2025 which is not the one configured on the health check rule.

Apologies if we have many questions, but we need to understand this because these are also the questions from the management after we presented the PingCastle report earlier.

Thanks!

Hi Rhondel,


PingCastle detects the Obsolete OS based on the date the report was run. So, in September it was not reported because the EoS was in October.

You can se the exact line here https://github.com/netwrix/pingcastle/blob/2d9ab43ba1f4343f5daa983a840a7de08bf28378/Healthcheck/Rules/HeatlcheckRuleStaledObsoleteW10.cs#L62

Hi Emiliano,

Good Day!

Thanks for the feedback. We ask this because in our September review, Windows 11 21H2 was not detected by PingCastle. If my understanding is correct, this was detected because of below advisory and the availability date?

[cid:492c8f01-5d95-49bc-a699-cbb59a9eb2b2@Image_2_]

[cid:48a0c8db-e49c-4d7e-9ab8-122b66752cc6@Image_3_]

Please advise.

Thanks!

Hello Rhondel,

Thanks for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

PingCastle is using the Microsoft docs and then include a check in the reports.

So Windows 10/11 for example is completed in this bit of code:
 https://github.com/netwrix/pingcastle/blob/2d9ab43ba1f4343f5daa983a840a7de08bf28378/Healthcheck/Rules/HeatlcheckRuleStaledObsoleteW10.cs#L21

You can then track the info back to

  *   Win 11 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information
  *   Win 10 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/release-information

Then, you can check the Obsolete OS section and check the information under each OS:
https://www.pingcastle.com/PingCastleFiles/ad_hc_rules_list.html#

Thank you for your patience. For Pro, Enterprise version, it does not have separate health check rule right? Noticed that for Win11 22H2, health check rule is below:

 



 

However, for below information, Pro version is already end of servicing:

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000IoaIr:ref

Hi Emiliano,

Good Day!

Thanks for the feedback. We ask this because in our September review, Windows 11 21H2 was not detected by PingCastle. If my understanding is correct, this was detected because of below advisory and the availability date?

[cid:7711bce1-dc5b-4810-9a87-61f663e116ba@Image_4_]

[cid:720af5cb-bf4e-45c0-95a3-47b09b9d72d7@Image_5_]

Please advise.

Thanks!

Hello Rhondel,

Thanks for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

PingCastle is using the Microsoft docs and then include a check in the reports.

So Windows 10/11 for example is completed in this bit of code:
 https://github.com/netwrix/pingcastle/blob/2d9ab43ba1f4343f5daa983a840a7de08bf28378/Healthcheck/Rules/HeatlcheckRuleStaledObsoleteW10.cs#L21

You can then track the info back to

  *   Win 11 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information
  *   Win 10 - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/release-information

Then, you can check the Obsolete OS section and check the information under each OS:
https://www.pingcastle.com/PingCastleFiles/ad_hc_rules_list.html#

Please let me know if you have any question.

Thank you!

Hi Rhondel,

After verifying, this is just a general expiration and EOL. 
So, no, there are no separate check rules for Pro and Enterprise versions.

Please let me know if you have any question.

Thank you!

Thank you for your patience. For Pro, Enterprise version, it does not have separate health check rule right? Noticed that for Win11 22H2, health check rule is below:

 



 

However, for below information, Pro version is already end of servicing:

Hi Rhondel,

No problem at all, I'm here to help you and clarify what you need!

I was checking this internally and we found that originally the end date was May 13th 2025, but now is updated.
You can see that here:
https://web.archive.org/web/20230318221605/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-10-enterprise-and-education

We logged this as a bug and it will be updated in the next release.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Thank you!

Yes, I understand that part where in the date on the rule was set to October 8, 2024:

 



 

However, where do you base these details?

 

For example, in Win10 22H2, the settings is below:

 



 

But where was this based? Looking at the other links you provided e.g. Window 10 release information, it was stated for version Win10 22H2 that the end of servicing is on October 14, 2025 which is not the one configured on the health check rule.

 

Apologies if we have many questions, but we need to understand this because these are also the questions from the management after we presented the PingCastle report earlier.

 

Thanks!

Hi Rhondel,
 
PingCastle detects the Obsolete OS based on the date the report was run. So, in September it was not reported because the EoS was in October.

You can se the exact line here  https://github.com/netwrix/pingcastle/blob/2d9ab43ba1f4343f5daa983a840a7de08bf28378/Healthcheck/Rules/HeatlcheckRuleStaledObsoleteW10.cs#L62
Please let me know if you have any question.

Thank you!
