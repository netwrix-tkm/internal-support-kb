Hi Brandon,

thank you for your reply.

I've just opened the ticked, because the error message requested it.
""Please contact support@pingcastle.com with the following details so the problem can be fixed""

The error happened only once when running the PingCastle 3.3.0.1 Client on my machine.
This is the full output of the command.

Currently I am not able to reproduce the issue.

I think we can close the ticket.","Netwrix Support Ticket #439089 - Client Error: PingCastle.Healthcheck.Rules.HeatlcheckRuleTrustFileDep","corvin.schmid@wuerth-it.com","Corvin Schmid","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-03-18T14:16:17.000Z","true"
