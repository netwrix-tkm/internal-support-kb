"500Qk00000NrOqHIAV","00441448","Support Ticket","How to use custom rules on standalone pingcastle client","Hello
This new ticket is on the same subject as support ticket 00439303.
Wahiba Bourahla has sent me a trial license for enterprise pingcastle version.
I've made a lot of tests on custom rules but the result is the same.
I think i don't use the custom rules with good syntax.
I've tried many solutions :

    
      
        
          
        
        
    



    
      
             
        
    


Could you give me the right syntax to increase RiskId=""P-DsheuristicsDoListObject"" to level 5 ?

Thank you
