"500Qk00000NLZghIAH","00440028","Support Ticket","Rule for ""LMCompatibilityLevel LM & NTLM""","There is the rule S-OldNtlm to ""ensure that the NTLMv1 and old LM protocols are banned"".

Unfortunately this rule does not differ between sending NTLMv1 (Level 0,1,2) and only accepting NTLMv1 (Level 3 & 4).
While accepting NTLMv1 is not great, the big risk is sending NTLMv1 due to MITM Attacks for Relaying and easy Cracking.

I know that I can filter for those domains in the ""Consolidation""
Dashboard => Risk Score => Consolidation => Password => Security settings
Search: LAN Manager authentication level

But Unfortunately it is not possible to create Action Plans or similar actions.

I also tried to modify the Rule S-OldNtlm, but unfortunately there is also no way to change the behavior there.","","","","Advised customer that the PingCastle team are considering adding action plans to unify the views however this will be available in future updates.

Regarding Rule Logic Modification, this is not something the team are actively pursuing at the moment however it can be added to the future plans of PingCastle.

Next:
