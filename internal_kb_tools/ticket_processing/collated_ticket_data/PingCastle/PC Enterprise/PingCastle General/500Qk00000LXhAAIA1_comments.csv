I asked for an escalation for this as I think it should likely work differently to how it does.

If you use an expired license in the PingCastle.exe.config but use the command line options to get information from PingCastle Pro/Ent the console application errors due to the license in the file being out of date.

For reference, this is an expired license to test with: 

`PC2H4sIAAAAAAAACmNkYGDgAGKGhhXsy/lvMzIDmXZA7MqQx1DCkMpQxFAAxJkMxUC2AkMaQz6Qp8DgB+SVMJSDZSqA/BAgKxHIzgPjdAYWoAkiOExhBYqD5LlAtoIsBuJ8TkmbgMU5HRpr7aR+7i6JOJd84Lic0GGdo/IFizLbvTv0ZbmilreWnT72ad2C/7Oqe6T5g3bZrn2UwrtTat468aMsGl1uddNP1abf+7fP+s6JBG5lXsMpLyz4/a6bpu4sXlqmd+az3u4pkoJ1s1ZIP6iaumTOeZH1mt/P7VCcZ+m0d5uQqyIAavfJ2QYBAAA=`

The code looks like it does the following:
* Checks PingCastle.exe.config for license and if no license then revert to the ""BasicEditionLicense"" that is baked into the release.
* Checks the validity of the license
  * When license not valid throws the ""Unsupported"" error
* Starts to parse command line args
* Downloads updated license from server.

Joe sent a workaround for this case.

We considered it closed.
This fix was planned to be released in 3.4, which will be May.
If there is an urgent need for it, we will move it to 3.3 and force its delivery.
