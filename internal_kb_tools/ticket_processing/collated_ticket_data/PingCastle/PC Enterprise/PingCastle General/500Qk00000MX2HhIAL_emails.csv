Dear Akhil,

Here are the steps to upgrade to the latest version of PingCastle Enterprise:

Upgrade Steps:

	Review the upgrade documentation and what's new section for any prerequisite changes.
	Download the upgrade pack zip file from the provided source.
	Stop IIS to prevent conflicts during the upgrade.
	Extract the zip file over the existing installation directory.
	Ensure that all pre-requisites are met before proceeding.
	Start IIS after completing the upgrade.

I have also attached a PowerShell script that automates the upgrade process for your convenience.

Please let us know if you need any further assistance, including help with API capabilities.

Best regards,
Iulia Apatachioaei
Sr. Support Engineer
