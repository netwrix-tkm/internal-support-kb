Chris Kiel from HP Inc is trying to install the latest version of Ping Castle but is having issues with installing the database creation piece.  Can someone please reach out to him to assist?

Original email:

Hey Gabby,

I finally spent some time with this today.  I’m stuck on the database creation piece and the online documentation hasn’t been any help.  Is there someone I should contact or should I just open a support case?

Thanks!
