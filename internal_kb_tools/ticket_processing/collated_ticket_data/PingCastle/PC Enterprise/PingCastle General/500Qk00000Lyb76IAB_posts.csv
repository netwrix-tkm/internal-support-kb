This results in redundant configurations when managing multiple exclusions. It would be beneficial to allow a single rule to handle multiple values at once, enabling users to exclude multiple accounts in a more efficient way.

Proposed Enhancement:

Allow the ""Rule Item to Handle"" option to accept multiple values within a single rule.
Introduce functionality to add exceptions or action plans for multiple items simultaneously.
Current Limitation:

As of now, this is not possible due to the way it was originally implemented.
No existing workflow supports batch handling of exceptions or action plans.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-02-19T10:56:26.000Z"
