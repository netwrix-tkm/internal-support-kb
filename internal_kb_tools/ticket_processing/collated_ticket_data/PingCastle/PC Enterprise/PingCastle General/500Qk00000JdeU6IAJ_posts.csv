I tried to find info in the installation guide but some things are not clear enough for me.

My design is as follow:

I have installed pingcastle basic on satellite servers on servers from all domains I need to scan. And they should send the reports to the centralized server where pingcastle enterprise is installed. How does this work exactly. I would like to automate this using ansible job scheduled at a certain time. I see there is a need to call an API from the satellite server, how does it work and  what is the authentication process between the pingcastle basic servers and the pingcastle enterprise server please ?

Also, If I already have reports that I have run previously how can I import them on the enterprise server please ?","","","","0054u000008F3GEAA0","2024-12-18T09:27:24.000Z"
