meeting notes :
API Connection Test:
Tested the API connection using PowerShell.

API Communication:
Reviewed how the API communicates between their servers.

Certificates Validation:
Checked certificates and verified their validity.

SSO Check:
Checked the Single Sign-On (SSO) setup. All signs point to SSO authentication issues.

Firewall Assessment:
Determined that the issue is not related to a firewall.

Connection Testing:
Tested the connection over HTTP, and the results were successful with IIS logs showing all 200 status codes.

HTTPS Issue:
Encountered issues with HTTPS—received an RST response. It is unclear whether this is caused by the load balancer on the enterprise server.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-01-28T10:57:23.000Z"
