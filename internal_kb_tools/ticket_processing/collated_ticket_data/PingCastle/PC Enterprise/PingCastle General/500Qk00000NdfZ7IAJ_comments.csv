**Customer Setup**
This customer users OpenIdConnect with Entra ID and PingCastle Enterprise and is on 3.3.0.8.

**Manage My Account with OIDC**
The Manage My Account page only shows the following when using OIDC. This should at minimum include the ""View my users claims"" option.

**OIDC Claims**
The customer is attempting to use the standard role claim that we also use `http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role` but it is not granting access to anything. They are using Entra ID as the OIDC provider so need to work out how the claims work. I think I can likely fix this specific issue.

This may be the same issue as Escalation 379835 How do ""Claim permissions"" work?, but with regard to OpenId, rather than SAML2 - OpenId login code does not propagate claims into the PingCastleEnterprise session.

The missing 'View my user's claims' and 'View my sessions' options have been returned in code changes for User Story 381362 [Ticket] SAML2 users can create a local password
