Hello Akhil!

Please note that the following needs to be taken into consideration when upgrading:

  1.  Check the upgrade documentation and/or whats new for potential pre-requisite changes
  2.  Download the upgrade pack zip file
  3.  Stop IIS
  4.  Extract the zip over the installation directory
  5.  Ensure pre-requisites are met
  6.  Start IIS

FYI: Major upgrade is the ASP.NET 6 -> ASP.NET 8 from v3.2 to v3.3

More details regarding the upgrade can be found in our helpcenter guide here<https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/PingCastle_3.3_ProUpgrade/page/Before_proceeding_to_the_upgrade.html>

These details should be all you need to upgrade your PingCastle version. However, if you still feel that there is a need to schedule a call, please let me know about your availability and I will schedule a meeting.

Kind regards,

Shaheryar Ali
Technical Support Engineer
Netwrix Corportation



Main thing is the ASP.NET 6 -> ASP.NET 8 upgrade is from 3.2 to 3.3

Hello Akhil!

Please note that the following needs to be taken into consideration when upgrading:


	Check the upgrade documentation and/or whats new for potential pre-requisite changes
	Download the upgrade pack zip file
	Stop IIS
	Extract the zip over the installation directory
	Ensure pre-requisites are met
	Start IIS


FYI: Major upgrade is the ASP.NET 6 -> ASP.NET 8 from v3.2 to v3.3

More details regarding the upgrade can be found in our helpcenter guide  here

These details should be all you need to upgrade your PingCastle version. However, if you still feel that there is a need to schedule a call, please let me know about your availability and I will schedule a meeting.

Kind regards,

Shaheryar Ali
Technical Support Engineer
Netwrix Corportation
 

 

Main thing is the ASP.NET 6 -> ASP.NET 8 upgrade is from 3.2 to 3.3

Hi Shaheryar,

 

As discussed in the call, when I download the package, I get the issue below, as our proxy blocked it. Please share the ZIP folder via email so that I can share it with the respective teams.

 

You still haven’t shared the file. Please share the file.
