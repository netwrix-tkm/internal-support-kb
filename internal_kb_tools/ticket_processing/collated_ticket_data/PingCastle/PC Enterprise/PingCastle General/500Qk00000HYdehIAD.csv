$response | ConvertTo-Json","","There is a bug in the API deletion. It seems that when any session is open, even after closing the browser, as the session stays in the DB for some time, and then can't delete the user and any permission granted to Azure AD.
The team is working on a hotfix for it, so you will be notified once the hotfix is out.

Something worth to mention, is that if you use the UI, it works, so you can use the UI while the team works on the solution.","Wait for customer confirmation after explaining it was fixed in the latest release","Symptom
