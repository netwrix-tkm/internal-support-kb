can you please provide me a guide how to permit users from Child domains on Entities in Ping Castle via Claims. 
I have added a Claim permission on an entity with the following configuration:

ClaimsType: <a href='http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/groupsid' target='_blank'>http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/groupsid</a>
ClaimValue: 
Authorization: Operator (view the domain reports and edit actions plans)

After setting the permissions, the user can login to PingCastle, but he can not see any Domain reports, but only Infrastructure Menu and parts of the Configuration menu. Even if i permit the group on a domain explicitly there are no reports shown. If i grant the permissions on user basis, the reports for the domains are shown.

Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Tom","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-12-16T05:22:20.000Z"
