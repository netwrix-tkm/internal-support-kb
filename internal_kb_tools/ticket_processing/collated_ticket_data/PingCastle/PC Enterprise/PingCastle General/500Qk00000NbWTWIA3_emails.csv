Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. I'm Rej and I'll be assisting you today.

To exclude specific findings that you know are false positives from a PingCastle rule scan without completely disabling the rule, you can use the PingCastle configuration file to customize the scan settings.

Add exclusions:


	
	
		Use the Exclude parameter to specify the findings you want to exclude. For example:

		
Exclude=S-PwdLastSet-Cluster,S-PwdLastSet-45

		
		This will exclude the specified findings from the scan results.
	
	
	
	Save and run the scan:

	
		Save the changes to the configuration file.
		Run the PingCastle scan again using the modified configuration.

Hello,

Thanks it helped me.

I have another question

For one rule I have a lot of findings that are false positives and I was wondering if we could  use the API for creating exceptions in a bunch to avoid having to do them one by one. On any other way please ?

Hello,

Thanks it helped me.

I have another question

 

For one rule I have a lot of findings that are false positives and I was wondering if we could  use the API for creating exceptions in a bunch to avoid having to do them one by one. On any other way please ?

Hello Thomas,

Apologies for the confusion, you need to click on the ""No Action Plan"" icon to create an exclusion. You also need to make sure you are doing a --Level Full scan.

Hello Thomas,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. I'm Rej and I'll be assisting you today.

To exclude specific findings that you know are false positives from a PingCastle rule scan without completely disabling the rule, you can use the PingCastle configuration file to customize the scan settings.

Add exclusions:

1.       

1.       


	 



	 



	
	
		Use the Exclude parameter to specify the findings you want to exclude. For example:
	
	



2.   


3.   


4.   


5.   


6.   


7.   


8.   


9.   


10. 


11. 


12. 


13. 


14. 


15. 


16. 


17.Exclude=S-PwdLastSet-Cluster,S-PwdLastSet-45

1.       


	 


1.       


	
	
		This will exclude the specified findings from the scan results.
	
	



	Save and run the scan:


1.       


	 


2.       


	
	
		Save the changes to the configuration file.
		Run the PingCastle scan again using the modified configuration.
