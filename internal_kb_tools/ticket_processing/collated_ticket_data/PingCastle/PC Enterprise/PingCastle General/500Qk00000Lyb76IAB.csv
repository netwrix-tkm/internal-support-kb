"500Qk00000Lyb76IAB","00436055","Support Ticket","Rule Item to handle","Is there any in-depth documentation regarding creating rules and using the ""Rule Item to handle"" field. e.g. it would be good wo be able to create a rule that says ""ignore this rule if","","Currently, the ""Rule Item to Handle"" option in PingCastle requires users to apply the same rule separately to multiple accounts. This results in redundant configurations when managing multiple exclusions. It would be beneficial to allow a single rule to handle multiple values at once, enabling users to exclude multiple accounts in a more efficient way.

Proposed Enhancement:

Allow the ""Rule Item to Handle"" option to accept multiple values within a single rule.
Introduce functionality to add exceptions or action plans for multiple items simultaneously.
Current Limitation:

As of now, this is not possible due to the way it was originally implemented.
No existing workflow supports batch handling of exceptions or action plans.","awaiting for the feature to be implemented, no ETA, not a priority
Thereâ€™s also no workflow to add exceptions or action plans for multiple at once right now","https://netwrix.productboard.com/all-notes/notes/46511027","","Iulia Apatachioaei","Question","PingCastle","PC Enterprise","PingCastle General","3.2.0.1","","15.7","Closed - Resolved","ASMPT","Gareth Harries","2025-02-17T14:50:23.000Z","2025-03-05T08:18:02.000Z"
