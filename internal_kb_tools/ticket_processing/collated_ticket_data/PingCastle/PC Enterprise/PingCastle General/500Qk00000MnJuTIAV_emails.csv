Thank you for your inquiry regarding SAML authentication with Ping Identity for PingCastle Enterprise. Below are the key steps to configure it:

PingCastle supports:

	Username (sAMAccountName or UPN)
	Email Address (mail attribute)
	Group Membership (if configured in Ping Identity)

PingCastle does not generate an SP metadata XML automatically. Instead, configure your IdP manually with the correct endpoints:


	Obtain the IdP Metadata URL from Ping Identity.
	Edit appsettings.Production.json and add:

""Saml2"": {
    ""Issuer"": ""https://your-IdP-issuer-url"",
    ""IdPMetadata"": ""https://your-IdP-metadata-url""
}

	Ensure the IdPMetadata URL is reachable from the PingCastle server.
	Restart PingCastle services or perform an IISRESET to apply changes.
	Verify that the IdPMetadata tag is correct.
	Ensure Ping Identity is sending the expected claims (Username, Email).
	Test login and check for errors in browser dev tools or server logs.

For reference, the full setup guide is available here:
PingCastle SAML Setup

Let me know if you need further assistance.

I have configured SAML2, but get an HTTP/500 error afterwards.
So I guess I have an error in my configuration.

As the Server is not able to reach the IdP directly, I have configured not the ""simple"" but the ""advanced"" SAML2 configuration. Like explained in the short guide.

Can we have a short call to review the configuration?","Netwrix Support Ticket #438367 - SAML Authentication","corvin.schmid@wuerth-it.com","Corvin Schmid","techsupport@netwrix.com","","","false","2025-03-14T14:03:01.000Z","true"

Dear Iulia,

I have another question, how is the email address from the IdP used in PingCastle Enterprise?

Is it possible to use JIT user creation? When a user is loggen in for the first time, that PingCastle automatically creates an account, and I have just to provide privileges?

There is also a bug in PingCastle Enterprise, when trying to create a user without an email address, the system crashes to an internal exception.

Error message: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.

Type: System.NullReferenceExceptio
