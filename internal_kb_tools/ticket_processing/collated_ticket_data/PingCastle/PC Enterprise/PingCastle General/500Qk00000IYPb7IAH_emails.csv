Hello,

Thank you for your swift answer.

There is still something not clear for me. From what I understand from the documentation I should install Pingcastle enterprise on one centralized server that will receive data from Pingcastle “satellite” servers where only  the basic free version can be installed. They would do the scanning and push data to Pingcastle enterprise server. How is the push of the data done please ? Meaning how the link between the satellites servers and the centralized servers is configured please ?

You don't need to do anything if you can access the Active Directory environments from the PingCastle enterprise server, you can just use the scheduling feature. Remember you need to change the app pool to local system for scheduling in the web app or you can manually schedule tasks.

The task just needs to run the following:
PingCastle.exe --healthcheck --level Full --api-endpoint https://pingcastle_enterprise_url --api-key API_Key
 
Relevant doc links:
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/PingCastle_3.3_EnterpriseInstall/page/Post_Installation_Scheduler.html#navPoint_11
https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/PingCastle_3.3_EnterpriseInstall/page/PingCastle_agent_deployment.html#navPoint_23
 
You just need to make an ""agent"" with the upload permission and then put the api_key in the command line stuff. Make sure you use -level Full....
