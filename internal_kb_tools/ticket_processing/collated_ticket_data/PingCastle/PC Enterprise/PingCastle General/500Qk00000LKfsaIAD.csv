"500Qk00000LKfsaIAD","00434352","Support Ticket","PingCastle not collecting Azure data","Customer has tried to run the scan for their environment using a standard license RTU key and no azure data is populating.","Step 1: Install PingCastle version 3.3.0.11.  
Step 2: Configure the scan using an enterprise license key.  
Step 3: Run the Azure AD scan using the command-line version (pingcastle.exe).  
Step 4: Ensure the scan account has Global Admin privileges.  
Step 5: Review the scan results and verify if Azure data populates correctly.

(Requested by Rejaul Uddin)","- The issue was caused by insufficient privileges for the scan account. PingCastle requires Global Admin privileges to successfully collect Azure data and populate indicators in the report.
- Tests with different tenants and privilege levels confirmed that indicators only appear when using accounts with Global Admin privileges. Accounts with lower privileges resulted in incomplete or zero-score reports.
- The problem was not related to the PingCastle version or license type, as the same behavior was observed across multiple builds and configurations.
- The customer confirmed that using an account with Global Admin privileges resolved the issue, allowing the scan to collect Azure data and populate indicators as expected.
- The ticket was closed after verifying that the resolution was effective and no further issues were reported.
