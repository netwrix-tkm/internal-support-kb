Bonjour, Iulia

 

I haven't taken the time to go into this.

But if you develop an API to enable the viewer role for several users on a domain, I'm interested.

 

Best regards.

Hi Jean,

Thank you for provided details.

The recommended approach would be to use claims-based authentication. This allows you to manage user access efficiently by:


	Creating a group (either in Active Directory for Windows Authentication or in your Identity Provider for SAML/OpenID Connect).
	Adding the necessary users to this group.
	Granting access to the group directly within the console.


However, if you wish to use the API, you will need to:


	Create the users,
	Retrieve all domains that the users need access to,
	And then grant the necessary authorization through the API.


Another way would be to create the permissions on an entity and assign the domains to said entity.

Let me know if you need any further assistance.

Best regards,
Iulia Apatachioaei

Hi Jean,

My name is Iulia and I am happy to assist you today.

To address the need for assigning roles to multiple users across one or more domains efficiently, we recommend using claims-based permissions in combination with an Identity Provider (IdP) or Windows Authentication to control access.

This approach will streamline user role management and reduce the need for manual assignments.

Please let us know if you need further assistance or additional details.
