Before we schedule a call, could you please confirm which authentication method you are using?


	Windows Authentication: Claims function properly with the latest version.
	SAML Authentication: Claims are currently not supported.


For role claims, please be aware that PingCastle might utilize the same role claims for its internal roles, which could lead to potential issues.

Concerning the scheduler, specific configurations are required to display the domain correctly. Please create a task schedule and modify the command line option to include a wildcard. For example, use --server *.example.com instead of --server .example.com. No other parameters should be altered or modified. This task must be located within the PingCastle task scheduler folder.

Hope this helps.

Hello Philipp,

We can certainly arrange a call, however our current engineers are based in the UK and according to your account you are US based. Is this the case?

On Role Claims: i made specifically sure that Role Names are not overlapping with internal Names.

On the scheduler: Please re-read my Issue with the scheduler. Your Response is not related to the Display Issue i´m describing.

Please schedule the meeting.

 

Thank you,

Hello Philipp,
 

Before we schedule a call, could you please confirm which authentication method you are using?


	Windows Authentication: Claims function properly with the latest version.
	SAML Authentication: Claims are currently not supported.


For role claims, please be aware that PingCastle might utilize the same role claims for its internal roles, which could lead to potential issues.

Concerning the scheduler, specific configurations are required to display the domain correctly. Please create a task schedule and modify the command line option to include a wildcard. For example, use --server *.example.com instead of --server .example.com. No other parameters should be altered or modified. This task must be located within the PingCastle task scheduler folder.

Hope this helps.

Thank you,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
- Claims and Domains via SSO: We investigated the issues with viewing Claims and Domains using a test user via SSO. Various methods were tested, including changing the username to an email address.
- Task Scheduler: Problems with the Task Scheduler were identified. The command was modified from --server domain.local to -server *, which resolved the issue.
- Scanning and Reporting: It was noted that failed scans are only visible in the logs. A suggestion was made to improve the reporting page visuals to clearly indicate ""Scan failed (check logs).""

I have raised an escalation to R&D for this ticket. Escalation ticket no: 0040964

At this time, we do not have a specific timeline for the resolutions. We are actively working on addressing the issues and will keep you updated as and when we can.
