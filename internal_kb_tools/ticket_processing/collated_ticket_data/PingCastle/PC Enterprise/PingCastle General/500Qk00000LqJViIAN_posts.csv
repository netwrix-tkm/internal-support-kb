Is there a quicker method for setting up a number of users with a role on one or more domains at the same time?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-13T14:07:11.000Z"

Identify the users who need to be assigned specific roles within the domain.
Manually assign roles to each user one by one within the domain management interface.
Repeat the manual assignment process for each user across one or more domains.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-02-13T14:43:36.000Z"

Create a group (either in Active Directory for Windows Authentication or in the identity provider for SAML/OpenID Connect).
Add users to the group and grant them access through the console.
//API Usage:
If using the API, users need to be created first.
Retrieve all domains the users need access to.
Grant authorization for those domains via the API (though this approach may be inefficient).
Ensure permissions are set on the entity level and assign domains to the entity if not already done.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-02-14T13:42:49.000Z"
