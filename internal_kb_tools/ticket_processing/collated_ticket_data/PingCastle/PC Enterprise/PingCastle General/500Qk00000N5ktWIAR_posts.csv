We have a problem with the ""DoListObject"" control. At this time it's a informative rule but we are blocked at oradad level 2 even if the global domain risk level is 0.
The ""DoListObject"" parameter is set because we have implemeted red forest model with masking administration OU.
Best regards","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-19T09:41:52.000Z"
