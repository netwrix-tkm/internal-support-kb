I have been trying to setup Claims and Role Configurations in PingCastle Enterprise.

Unforetunately, none of this is working.
Further, the Documentation is incorrect on available claims and where to find current Values.

Finally, there´s a visibility Issue with the Scheduler.

Claim Configuration Example:

Under Entities i have a SubFolder ""Production"", containing 2 Folder ""Primary Domain"" and ""Staging Domain"", each containing 5 Domains to be scanned by PingCastle.

The ""Production"" Entity is setup with the following Claim Configuration:

ClaimType: <a href='http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role' target='_blank'>http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role</a>
ClaimValue: Operator
Authorization: Operator

My Test User is signing in via SSO (Microsoft Entra ID) and is receiving the Role via the Entra Role Assignment.
However, the User cannot see anything within the System. 
No Domains, No Dashboard, no Entities.

Testing the Same Configuration on ""root"" level entities gives the same result.

Documentation Issues:

The Documentation states that a User can see his indiviual claims:

<a href='https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/PingCastle_3.3_EnterpriseUser/page/Authorization.html' target='_blank'>https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/PingCastle_3.3_EnterpriseUser/page/Authorization.html</a>
You can also open the “View my user’s claims page in “Manage your account” to see what claims have been pushed to Ping Castle.

This Page does not exist. While i found a way to show the ""debugging claims"", these should be available easier / reflected in the documentation.

Scheduler Issues:

The Scheduler Page is not showing all Tasks that are Setup via Task Scheduler.
The Scheduler Page only shows single Domain Scan Agent Tasks.

Tasks manually edited/setup with wildcards, which is fully Supported as per your documentation, do not show in the scheduler Page.
Scanning <a href='https://home.example.com' target='_blank'>home.example.com</a> => Showing on the scheduler Page
Scanning *<a href='https://.example.com' target='_blank'>.example.com</a> => Not showing on the scheduler Page

Please investigate and provide Solutions for the Issue.

Thank you,
Philipp","Attempt setting up claims and role configurations. Assign entra role and test visibility for a test user.
Create schedules and see if all schedules appear.","Claims and Domains via SSO: We investigated the issues with viewing Claims and Domains using a test user via SSO. Various methods were tested, including changing the username to an email address.
- Task Scheduler: Problems with the Task Scheduler were identified. The command was modified from --server domain.local to -server *, which resolved the issue.
- Scanning and Reporting: It was noted that failed scans are only visible in the logs. A suggestion was made to improve the reporting page visuals to clearly indicate ""Scan failed (check logs).""","escalated to R&D. Escalation ticket no: 0040964
