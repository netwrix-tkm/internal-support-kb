- The license details (issued date: April 14, 2024, expiration date: April 13, 2025) were confirmed to be correct, and the license itself was valid.
- The issue was identified as a setup error in the Netwrix Customer Portal, which affected access to training resources.
- A valid license was provided to the customer as a temporary measure to ensure continued use of PingCastle while the account activation issue was being resolved.
- The customer's access to training materials was eventually corrected, and they were able to confirm access to PingCastle under ""My Products"" and the training section.
- It was communicated that PingCastle is a newer acquisition, and the availability of training materials is currently limited, with more content being developed and planned for release.
- The customer emphasized the importance of accessing training materials to learn more about the solution, highlighting a need for timely updates on available courses.
