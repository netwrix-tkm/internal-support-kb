Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Have taken down questions to ask our PingCastle team.

Migration Process:

Should we uninstall PingCastle on Server X and then deploy it on Server Y, or should we deploy it on Server Y first and then uninstall it on Server X?

Duplicate Domain Handling:

After deploying PingCastle on the new server, will the existing duplicate domain be automatically deleted, or do we need to perform any manual tasks?

New API Key and Encryption Key:

Do we need to create a new entity, API key, and encryption key for the new server?


Existing Keys:

If we do need to create new keys, what happens to the existing ones?

API issue:

How can we configure the API to display a list of domains, including the entity's full name column?
 

Our next steps are:

Send the questions to our PingCastle team and await confirmation. We will get back to you as soon as we can.

Hello Korepu Akhil,

The following is the advice for migrating PingCastle


	Stop IIS so its not using DB
	Copy the database to the new server
	Import database in new server
	Install PingCastle Enterprise on the new server
	If the URL changes you'll need to update the agents --api-endpoint
	Setup new API key and Encryption key, do not use existing.


Let me know if you need anything else.

Thank you,

Rej Uddin

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:
Answered the following questions:

Should we uninstall PingCastle on Server X and then deploy it on Server Y, or should we deploy it on Server Y first and then uninstall it on Server X?
A simple uninstall/delete and reinstall should be fine.

Steps to follow:
- Download PingCastleEnterprise.zip file from Netwrix product downloads
- Stop IIS - iisreset /stop
- Install ASP.NET 8 Hosting Bundle - https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/0f847bc4-a961-4905-b1c2-93ebcff6604d/2b84b548511efc82dc679e9bed6bbf9b/dotnet-hosting-8.0.13-win.exe
- Uninstall ASP.NET 6 Hosting Bundle from server (Completely optional)
- Extract zip file over C:pingCastleEnterprise (or wherever pingcastle enterprise is installed)
- Start IIS - iisreset

ASP.NET PS:
# Direct Download Link
$Uri = ""https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/Runtime/8.0.15/dotnet-hosting-8.0.15-win.exe""
$DownloadDirectory = ""C:Tools""
$Executable = ""$DownloadDirectory`aspnet8.exe""
if(-Not (Test-Path $DownloadDirectory)){ mkdir $DownloadDirectory }
# Download
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $Uri -OutFile ""$Executable""
# Install
& $Executable /install /quiet

After deploying PingCastle on the new server, will the existing duplicate domain be automatically deleted, or do we need to perform any manual tasks?
There won't be any duplicate domains, it uses SID so duplicates won't be created.

Do we need to create a new entity, API key, and encryption key for the new server?
Any keys can be used

How can we configure the API to display a list of domains, including the entity's full name column?
To Retrieve the Entity Full Name from the API:
1. Query the /api/Domain endpoint for a list of domains
- Note the OwnerID is the Entity
2. Query the /api/Owners endpoint for a list of all entities
- Match the ID with the owner

PS:

# Run Connect-PCServer first
# Get All Owners
$Owners = Get-PCOwner
# Get All Domains -> Extract OwnerId to $Oid -> Match OwnerIds -> output the name as Entity
Get-PCDomain -Raw | Select-Object Id, Name, @{Name = ""Entity"" ; Expression = {$OId = $_.OwnerId ; $Owners | where { $_.Id -eq $Oid} | Select -expand name }}

Your next steps are:
- Follow these steps with the client.
- Keep us updated

Thank you,

Hello Korepu Akhil,

Thank you for taking the time to meet today.

Today we:

Have taken down questions to ask our PingCastle team.

Migration Process:

Should we uninstall PingCastle on Server X and then deploy it on Server Y, or should we deploy it on Server Y first and then uninstall it on Server X?

Duplicate Domain Handling:

After deploying PingCastle on the new server, will the existing duplicate domain be automatically deleted, or do we need to perform any manual tasks?

New API Key and Encryption Key:

Do we need to create a new entity, API key, and encryption key for the new server?


Existing Keys:

If we do need to create new keys, what happens to the existing ones?

API issue:

How can we configure the API to display a list of domains, including the entity's full name column?
 

Our next steps are:

Send the questions to our PingCastle team and await confirmation. We will get back to you as soon as we can.

Thank you,
