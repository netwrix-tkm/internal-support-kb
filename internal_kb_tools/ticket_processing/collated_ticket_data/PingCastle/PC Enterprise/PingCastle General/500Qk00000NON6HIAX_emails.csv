Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. I'm Rej and I'll be assisting you today.
When exceptions are removed from the report, the score for the affected category will decrease. If this category previously had the highest score, it will impact the overall domain score.

You will need run a new report after applying exceptions to see the updated results. The new report will reflect the changes in scores and provide an accurate assessment of the current security posture.

I hope this answers your question. If you have anymore questions please raise a new ticket.

We apologize for the delay. As we have recently acquired PingCastle, we are currently developing comprehensive documentation and guides. In the interim, we are available to assist you through our ticket portal.

Hello Korepu Akhil,

I’m reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven’t heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00440177
Ticket Subject: Questions on Exceptions.
Ticket Details: Hi Team,

Good day!!

We applied Exceptions for a few rules for a few domains.


1. Will the Domain Score be dropped after applying exceptions?
2. Will these exceptions decrease the Organization's global score? (1st question answer may help with this)

3. Is it mandatory to run the new report after an exception is applied to see the results? (At present, we are running the report)


Please share all the documentation related to Exceptions and exceptions' role in the Domain Score


Thanks,
Akhil

Thank you!
