Good Morning Iulia,

Our latest test of Azure reporting with the new build failed.  The report took almost 9 hours to complete but still no indicators.  The Onedrive share we had been using for file transfers seem to be gone.  Can you give me another share to upload these files?

Thanks,

-Chris

Hi Iulia,

Thanks for the new build.  I am not the expert on our Azure environment (I’m the engineer for one of our on-prem domains), but I was aware of the Powershell MSOnline EOL on March 31st.  I will check with our cloud team and see if they have any restrictions in place.  I have another engineer with the global reader role running this test and I will send you the results and logs ASAP.

Sincerely,

Chris Keil

Dear Christopher,

Following up on the issue, please proceed with the steps below and share the results with us:

  1.  Download the new build <https://releases.netwrix.com/products/pingcastle/3.3/pingcastle-standard-3.3.0.9.zip>
  2.  Run the Azure AD scan again, this time using logging options enabled.
  3.  Share the scan results and logs for further analysis.

Additionally, could you confirm whether the PowerShell MSOnline module is restricted in any way on your side?

Lastly, I’d like to inform you that we will be migrating to Microsoft Graph as soon as we complete the work for the current release.

Looking forward to your update. Let me know if you need any assistance.

Best regards,
Iulia Apatachioaei
Sr. Support Engineer

We need to retrieve additional logs from your side for the development team—could you assist in providing those?

Additionally, could you check if there’s anything on your end that might be blocking Azure AD PowerShell or any related services?

If needed, we can schedule a troubleshooting meeting to go through this in more detail. Please let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Looking forward to your update.

We need to retrieve additional logs from HP for the development team—could you assist in obtaining those?

Additionally, could you check if there’s anything on HP’s side potentially blocking Azure AD PowerShell or any related services?

If needed, we can set up a troubleshooting meeting to go through this in more detail. Also, should I reach out to HP directly? If so, could you provide the specific email contact, or will you be handling it?

Looking forward to your update.

Hi Gabby,

They should be able to use the same key since the version remains Standard.

Here is the direct download link:
PingCastle Standard 3.3.0.8<https://releases.netwrix.com/products/pingcastle/3.3/pingcastle-standard-3.3.0.8.zip>

Please let us know if everything works as expected.

Hi there,



This is great news! The customer has been running a standard POC key – with that being said, do we need to reissue a new key with the updated version or can they upgrade with the current key that they have?



Thank you,

Hi team,



The HP team is asking for a timeline to resolution on this. Do we have any ideas as to when the log review will be completed and we can rerun the scan with them?

Good Morning Iulia,

 

Our latest test of Azure reporting with the new build failed.  The report took almost 9 hours to complete but still no indicators.  The Onedrive share we had been using for file transfers seem to be gone.  Can you give me another share to upload these files?

 

Thanks,

 

-Chris

Hi Iulia,

 

Thanks for the new build.  I am not the expert on our Azure environment (I’m the engineer for one of our on-prem domains), but I was aware of the Powershell MSOnline EOL on March 31st.  I will check with our cloud team and see if they have any restrictions in place.  I have another engineer with the global reader role running this test and I will send you the results and logs ASAP.

 

Sincerely,

 

Chris Keil

CAUTION: External Email 


Dear Christopher, 

Following up on the issue, please proceed with the steps below and share the results with us:  


	Download the new  build 
	Run the Azure AD scan again, this time using logging options enabled.  
	Share the scan results and logs for further analysis.  



Additionally, could you confirm whether the PowerShell MSOnline module is restricted in any way on your side?  

Lastly, I’d like to inform you that we will be migrating to Microsoft Graph as soon as we complete the work for the current release.  

Looking forward to your update. Let me know if you need any assistance.

We need to retrieve additional logs from your side for the development team—could you assist in providing those?

Additionally, could you check if there’s anything on your end that might be blocking Azure AD PowerShell or any related services?

If needed, we can schedule a troubleshooting meeting to go through this in more detail. Please let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Dear Gabby,

We need to retrieve additional logs from HP for the development team—could you assist in obtaining those?

Additionally, could you check if there’s anything on HP’s side potentially blocking Azure AD PowerShell or any related services?

If needed, we can set up a troubleshooting meeting to go through this in more detail. Also, should I reach out to HP directly? If so, could you provide the specific email contact, or will you be handling it?

Looking forward to your update.

Hi Gabby,

They should be able to use the same key since the version remains Standard.

Here is the direct download link:
PingCastle Standard 3.3.0.8

Please let us know if everything works as expected.

Hi there,

 

This is great news! The customer has been running a standard POC key – with that being said, do we need to reissue a new key with the updated version or can they upgrade with the current key that they have?

 

Thank you,

Hi team,

 

The HP team is asking for a timeline to resolution on this. Do we have any ideas as to when the log review will be completed and we can rerun the scan with them?

Hi Chris,

I wanted to provide you with some additional insight as to where we’re at with this effort.  Ultimately the team is working on migrating the bad calls from the provisioningAPI (the MSOnline)  to the graph API for the deprecation on March 30th. We have a developer currently assigned to and working on this.  If we have an available beta build before the GA release we will provide it once ready.  There is some suspicion there is something on the Microsoft side blocking us somewhere as we have been unable to reproduce the behavior.

Hopefully this provides you some clarity on where things stand.  If you have any additional questions please let us know.

Best regards,

Taylor

Good Morning Iulia,

Our latest test of Azure reporting with the new build failed.  The report took almost 9 hours to complete but still no indicators.  The Onedrive share we had been using for file transfers seem to be gone.  Can you give me another share to upload these files?

Thanks,

Hi Iulia,

Thanks for the new build.  I am not the expert on our Azure environment (I’m the engineer for one of our on-prem domains), but I was aware of the Powershell MSOnline EOL on March 31st.  I will check with our cloud team and see if they have any restrictions in place.  I have another engineer with the global reader role running this test and I will send you the results and logs ASAP.

Sincerely,

Chris Keil

Dear Christopher,

Following up on the issue, please proceed with the steps below and share the results with us:

  1.  Download the new build <https://releases.netwrix.com/products/pingcastle/3.3/pingcastle-standard-3.3.0.9.zip>
  2.  Run the Azure AD scan again, this time using logging options enabled.
  3.  Share the scan results and logs for further analysis.

Additionally, could you confirm whether the PowerShell MSOnline module is restricted in any way on your side?

Lastly, I’d like to inform you that we will be migrating to Microsoft Graph as soon as we complete the work for the current release.

Looking forward to your update. Let me know if you need any assistance.

Best regards,
Iulia Apatachioaei

Hi Gabby,

They should be able to use the same key since the version remains Standard.

Here is the direct download link:
PingCastle Standard 3.3.0.8<https://releases.netwrix.com/products/pingcastle/3.3/pingcastle-standard-3.3.0.8.zip>

Please let us know if everything works as expected.

Best regards,
Iulia Apatachioaei

Hi there,



This is great news! The customer has been running a standard POC key – with that being said, do we need to reissue a new key with the updated version or can they upgrade with the current key that they have?



Thank you,

Hi Team,



Do we have any updates? I informed the HP team last week that I would keep them posted on a fix but haven't heard from the team on where this stands.



Please advise.

Hi team,



The HP team is asking for a timeline to resolution on this. Do we have any ideas as to when the log review will be completed and we can rerun the scan with them?
