This new ticket is on the same subject as support ticket 00439303.
Wahiba Bourahla has sent me a trial license for enterprise pingcastle version.
I've made a lot of tests on custom rules but the result is the same.
I think i don't use the custom rules with good syntax.
I've tried many solutions :

    
      
        
          
        
        
    



    
      
             
        
    


Could you give me the right syntax to increase RiskId=""P-DsheuristicsDoListObject"" to level 5 ?

Thank you
Best regards","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-09T13:01:30.000Z"
