Based on the on-premises scans conducted by PingCastle, there is a Hybrid environment in place hence why its showing on-prem and cloud domains.

To address this, navigate to the console and follow these steps:

Go to Infrastructure >  Azure > locate and select the desired domain. Click on ""Edit"" and modify the status as required, Either to ""Not in Scope,"" ""Removed,"" or any other appropriate designation.

Note that selecting ""Removed"" will effectively eliminate the domain from the scope, whereas marking it as ""Not in Scope"" may still display it in certain views.

Hi Rej,

Good day!!

Can you please provide me with the answer to the following questions?


  1.  If these Azure domains are not removed from the scope, will it affect the global score of the Organization?
  2.  Are these domains also considered for global score calculation?


Thanks and Regards,

For both questions, the answer is yes. These factors will impact the global score since they contribute to the overall evaluation. As previously advised, you can exempt these domains from the report if necessary. However, as they are integral to the hybrid environment, it is advisable to follow appropriate measures to reduce the score for those domains as a best practice.
