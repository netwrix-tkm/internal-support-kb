"500Qk00000PKjiYIAT","00445578","Support Ticket","Upgradation of PingCastle on Dev Server","Hi Team,

Good day!!

We are planning to upgrade the PingCastle version on the development server first and then on a production server.

We are planning a change to do that, and I will share with you the Invite.

We need someone from support to join the call and guide us, as this is the first time we are performing this upgrade.

It would be great if ""Joseph Dibley"" joins the call.


Thanks,
Akhil","","","","Scheduled a meeting where we:
