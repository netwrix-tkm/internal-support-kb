Hello Thomas,

I’m reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven’t heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00441807
Ticket Subject: Create Exclusions with API
Ticket Details: For one rule I have a lot of findings that are false positives and I was wondering if we could use the API for creating exceptions in a bunch to avoid having to do them one by one. On any other way please ?

Thank you!
