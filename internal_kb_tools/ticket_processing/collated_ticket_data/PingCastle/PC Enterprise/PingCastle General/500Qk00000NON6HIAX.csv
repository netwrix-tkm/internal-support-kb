Good day!!

We applied Exceptions for a few rules for a few domains.


1. Will the Domain Score be dropped after applying exceptions?
2. Will these exceptions decrease the Organization's global score? (1st question answer may help with this)

3. Is it mandatory to run the new report after an exception is applied to see the results? (At present, we are running the report)


Please share all the documentation related to Exceptions and exceptions' role in the Domain Score


Thanks,
Akhil","","","","customer had some questions on exceptions.
