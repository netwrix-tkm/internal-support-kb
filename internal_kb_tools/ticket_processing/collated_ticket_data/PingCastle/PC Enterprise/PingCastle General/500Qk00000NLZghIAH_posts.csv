Unfortunately this rule does not differ between sending NTLMv1 (Level 0,1,2) and only accepting NTLMv1 (Level 3 & 4).
While accepting NTLMv1 is not great, the big risk is sending NTLMv1 due to MITM Attacks for Relaying and easy Cracking.

I know that I can filter for those domains in the ""Consolidation""
Dashboard => Risk Score => Consolidation => Password => Security settings
Search: LAN Manager authentication level

But Unfortunately it is not possible to create Action Plans or similar actions.

I also tried to modify the Rule S-OldNtlm, but unfortunately there is also no way to change the behavior there.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-26T12:57:33.000Z"
