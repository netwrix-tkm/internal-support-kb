Good day!

Our end-users are requesting if there are any API Capabilities to fetch the below-mentioned details from PingCastle Console, as it is very hard to find those details after downloading the reports.

Details required from API --

-Total score and scores for each of the 4 sections for every domain we are integrated with
-Finding for each of the sections, their score, and the organization where the findings were discovered (domain)
-Table with all admin users per domain with all additional available attributes (e.g. if the account is active)
-Table with user accounts where we can identify accounts with never expiring passwords set up
oThe dataset needs to have information that will allow us to look up what password policies are set up on the account
-Table with password policies set up on the domain level
-Table with DNS admins enumerated


Please schedule a call so that we can have a clear understanding of the requirements.


Thanks,
Akhil","","Customer's end-users are requesting if there are any API Capabilities to fetch the below-mentioned details from PingCastle Console, as it is very hard to find those details after downloading the reports.
