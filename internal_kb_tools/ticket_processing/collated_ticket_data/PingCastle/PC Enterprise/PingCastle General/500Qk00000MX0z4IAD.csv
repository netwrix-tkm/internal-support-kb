"500Qk00000MX0z4IAD","00437607","Support Ticket","Issues with Stale Objects rule (False Positive) for one of the domain.","The stale object rule ""Number of computers without password change for at least 3 months: 14"" is incorrectly flagging computer accounts as vulnerable, despite their passwords having been recently changed. Additionally, some computer accounts display future timestamps under the last used attribute.","Run a PingCastle security scan, specifically checking the stale object rules.
Observe that the rule ""Number of computers without password change for at least 3 months"" flags 14 computer accounts.
Verify that these accounts have recently updated their passwords.
Check the last used timestamps for these accounts and note that some show future values.
Attempt to validate the pwdLastSet and lastLogonTimestamp attributes in Active Directory.","PingCastle relies on the pwdLastSet and lastLogonTimestamp attributes to determine password change status.
PingCastle has built-in validation for future timestamps but may not be handling certain cases correctly.
Potential Causes:
Future Timestamps in AD – If timestamps are incorrect, PingCastle may misinterpret them.
Replication Delays – Out-of-sync domain controllers might be providing stale data.
Timezone or System Clock Issues – Inconsistent time settings on machines or domain controllers could skew timestamps.
Internal Logic Handling in PingCastle – Some scenarios might not be covered by its validation logic.","Check AD Attributes for Affected Computers:
Run the following PowerShell command to confirm pwdLastSet and lastLogonTimestamp values:
Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties Name, pwdLastSet, lastLogonTimestamp | 
Where-Object { $_.Name -in @(""Computer1"", ""Computer2"", ...) } | 
Select-Object Name, pwdLastSet, lastLogonTimestamp
Verify Domain Controller Replication:
Run:
repadmin /showrepl
Ensure replication is functioning properly and data is consistent across DCs.
Test a Manual Password Reset for One Affected Computer:
If resetting the password updates the timestamp correctly, replication or time drift may be the root cause.
Check Domain Controller Time Synchronization:
Run:
w32tm /query /status
Identify any inconsistencies in time settings across DCs.","Check AD Attributes for Affected Computers:
Run the following PowerShell command to verify timestamps:
Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties Name, pwdLastSet, lastLogonTimestamp |
Where-Object { $_.Name -in @(""Computer1"", ""Computer2"", ...) } |
Select-Object Name, pwdLastSet, lastLogonTimestamp
Verify Domain Controller Replication:
Ensure replication is functioning correctly across all DCs:
repadmin /showrepl
Test a Manual Password Reset:
Reset the password for one of the affected computers.
Check if the timestamps update correctly. If they do, the issue may be replication delays or time drift.
Check Domain Controller Time Synchronization:
Run the following command to check for time inconsistencies:
w32tm /query /status
If necessary, synchronize time settings across domain controllers.
Review PingCastle's Handling of Timestamps:
Validate whether PingCastle is correctly processing timestamps and handling future dates.
If needed, report a potential bug or logic flaw in the tool.","","Iulia Apatachioaei","Unexpected Behavior","PingCastle","PC Enterprise","PingCastle General","3.2.0.1","","13.0","Closed - Resolved","Eurofins GSC IT Poland Sp. z.o.o.","Korepu Akhil Kumar","2025-03-04T09:22:33.000Z","2025-03-17T09:42:51.000Z"
