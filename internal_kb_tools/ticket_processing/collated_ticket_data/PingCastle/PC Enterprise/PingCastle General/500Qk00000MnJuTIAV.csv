"500Qk00000MnJuTIAV","00438367","Support Ticket","SAML Authentication","We are in the process of configuring SAML authentication for our PingCastle Enterprise instance using Ping Identity as the Identity Provider (IdP). However, the official documentation does not fully cover the integration details. Specifically, we need clarification on supported attributes and the creation of the Service Provider (SP) Metadata XML file.","Attempt to configure PingCastle Enterprise to use SAML authentication.
Check available attributes that PingCastle can utilize (Username, Email, Group Membership).
Look for an option in PingCastle to generate an SP Metadata XML file automatically.
Attempt to configure the SAML authentication manually by modifying appsettings.Production.json with the provided Ping Identity metadata URL.
Restart PingCastle services or perform an IISRESET.
Attempt a test login via SAML and check for authentication failures.
Inspect browser developer tools and server logs for potential errors.","PingCastle supports the following attributes:
Username (sAMAccountName or UPN)
Email (mail attribute)
Group Membership (if configured in Ping Identity)
PingCastle does not generate an SP Metadata XML file automatically. Instead, manual configuration is required by editing appsettings.Production.json.
The IdPMetadata URL must be accessible from the PingCastle server.
Claims sent from Ping Identity must match the expected attributes for successful authentication.
Debugging requires checking logs, browser dev tools, and ensuring correct claim mapping.","Confirm the required attributes are correctly mapped in Ping Identity.
Ensure the IdPMetadata URL is accessible from the PingCastle server.
Validate that the correct attributes (Username, Email, Group Membership) are being sent by Ping Identity.
Restart PingCastle services and retest authentication.
If issues persist, review logs and browser dev tools for additional troubleshooting.","SAML authentication for PingCastle Enterprise was successfully implemented using Ping Identity. The necessary attributes were mapped correctly, and manual configuration in appsettings.Production.json ensured proper integration. After restarting the PingCastle services, authentication was tested and confirmed to be working as expected.","Guidance","Iulia Apatachioaei","Question","PingCastle","PC Enterprise","PingCastle General","3.3","","8.0","Closed - Resolved","WÃ¼rth IT GmbH","Corvin Schmid","2025-03-11T10:54:43.000Z","2025-03-19T10:23:12.000Z"
