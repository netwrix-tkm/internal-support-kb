Good day!!

As discussed in the call, in the KPI report, it is showing some Domains whose name ends with  ""<a href='https://.onmicrosoft.com' target='_blank'>.onmicrosoft.com</a>"" which are not even onboarded.

Can you please let me know why it is showing, and provide me necessary steps on what to do so that it won't be visible on the KPI report.

Please find the attachment for your reference.

Thanks,
