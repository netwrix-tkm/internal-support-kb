After checking the information, It looks as it is configured but there are some potential reasons why this may be picked up, so you can verify them:

	Is the GPO Located in a parent domain but linked to this domain? - This is a current limitation of the tool due to us specifically using SYSVOL to interogate the direct group policy files. In this case the registry.pol
	Is the Security filtering applied to GPO_S_WSWMODC_113 stopping the PingCastle account from accessing the files? You may need to grant ""read"" access on the group policy for the PingCastle account (If using the scheduler with SYSTEM then this would be the computer account)
	Does Pingcastle.exe have access to \dmz.belastingdienst.nlsysvol? Is the firewall locked down for file access or similar?

Thank you in advance.

Hello Emiliano,

It turned out that the System (Computer) account, used by the PingCastle
schedule, did not have read permissions on some of the Grouppolicy Objects.
We solved this issue and now we get the correct result from PingCastle. you
can close this issue.
