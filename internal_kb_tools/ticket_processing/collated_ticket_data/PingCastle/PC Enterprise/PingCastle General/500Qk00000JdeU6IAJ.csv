My design is as follow:

I have installed pingcastle basic on satellite servers on servers from all domains I need to scan. And they should send the reports to the centralized server where pingcastle enterprise is installed. How does this work exactly. I would like to automate this using ansible job scheduled at a certain time. I see there is a need to call an API from the satellite server, how does it work and  what is the authentication process between the pingcastle basic servers and the pingcastle enterprise server please ?

Also, If I already have reports that I have run previously how can I import them on the enterprise server please ?","at the first login into enterprise version, where a new use has to be created, a generic error message appears after inserting credentials, as shown in the screenshot sent","customer tries to login, by creating a new user, but a generic error message appears after inserting credentials, as shown in the screenshot sent","scheduled a meeting in order to see what exactly the issue is, as it might have several causes
after meeting, found out a bug into the application when creating the user, for the time being a workaround was found ( email is mandatory )","The customer did not input an email address during user creation, which caused the error. Resolved the issue by completing the user registration and adding the email address. Additionally, provided the customer with guidance on importing reports from other domains and creating entities for them. Also informed the client about enforcing Windows Authentication after AD groups are created.  

A bug has been logged for the email issue (ADO Bug ID: 370361).","Product defect","Iulia Apatachioaei","Question","PingCastle","PC Enterprise","PingCastle General","3.3","3.3.0.3","68.4","Closed - Resolved","Euroclear SA/NV","Thomas Bozzini","2024-12-18T09:27:23.000Z","2025-02-24T19:43:42.000Z"
