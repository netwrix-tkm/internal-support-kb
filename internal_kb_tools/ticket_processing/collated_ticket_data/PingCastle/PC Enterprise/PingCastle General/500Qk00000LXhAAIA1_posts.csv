We've replaced the license on the server without any issues, but I was on the impression that the client will also get the correct license via API call.

-------------------
Free Edition of PingCastle 3.3.0 - Not for commercial use
Starting the task: Retrieve Settings via API
[10:14:41] API Login OK
[10:14:41] OK
[10:14:41] A new license has been retrieved from the API. Using it.
[10:14:41] Enterprise for WÃ¼rth IT GmbH
Task Retrieve Settings via API completed
-------------------

This does not work if an expired license in in the <a href='https://PingCastle.exe' target='_blank'>PingCastle.exe</a>.config file.
Then you just get the following error message:
-----------
The program is unsupported since: 2025-02-06 00:00:00Z)
-----------

Should the program not first check for the API to see if there is a new license?
Just removing the line, will also confuse some people, as it starts with
----------
Free Edition of PingCastle 3.3.0 - Not for commercial use
----------

Is there a better way solve this issue, than replacing the license in all config files?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-06T09:27:47.000Z"
