Good day!!

We are planning to upgrade the PingCastle version on the development server first and then on production server.

Can you please share the documentation or steps to do the above activity?

We can have a short call for the discussion to see the current configuration and then proceed further.


Thanks,
Akhil","","","","Conducted a meeting with client to gave him an overview of PingCastle upgrade process and shared the relevant KB article.","Other","Shaheryar Ali Tahir","Request","PingCastle","PC Enterprise","PingCastle General","3.2.0.1","","14.1","Closed - Resolved","Eurofins GSC IT Poland Sp. z.o.o.","Korepu Akhil Kumar","2025-04-09T09:24:13.000Z","2025-04-23T11:49:01.000Z"
