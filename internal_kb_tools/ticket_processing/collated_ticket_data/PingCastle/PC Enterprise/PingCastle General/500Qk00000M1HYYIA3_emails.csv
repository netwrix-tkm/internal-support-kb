PingCastle now fully supports SAML2 authentication and is claims-aware, meaning it can use claims passed from your Identity Provider (IdP) to provision access.

Matching Logic for User Accounts:

	PingCastle matches user accounts based on the following SAML claims:

http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier
preferred_username
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress

	Metadata Requirements:

The Service Provider (SP) metadata is not something PingCastle generates.
You should use the IdP Metadata URL provided by your SAML Identity Provider (such as Okta, Ping Identity, ADFS, etc.).

	Configuration Steps:

You need to add the following section to the appsettings.json file on your PingCastle server:

""SAML2"": {
    ""IdPMetadataUrl"": ""https://your-idp-metadata-url"",
    ""Issuer"": ""PingCastle"",
    ""SignatureAlgorithm"": ""http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256"",
    ""AudienceRestricted"": true,
    ""RevocationMode"": ""NoCheck""
}

	Ensure the Single Sign-On URL is set correctly in your IdP:

https://yourPingCastleServer/Saml2/AssertionConsumerService


	Next Steps:

Could you confirm which IdP you’re using (Okta, Ping Identity, ADFS, etc.)?
If you don’t have the IdP Metadata URL, you’ll need to retrieve it from your Identity Provider’s settings.

Once you configure these settings and restart PingCastle, the SAML2 authentication option will appear on the login screen.

Let us know if you need further assistance.

Iulia Apatachioaei

Hello,

Do you have any news?

 

I found a temporary solution that allows me to receive an email again with the summary of the report, as well as a link to the full report.

To do this:

 

- I added my users to an AD security group. 

- Saved the SID of this security group in the configuration file: appsettings.Production.json (after ""WindowsGroup"") 

- I then added the users present in the group one by one in the application, entering their Username, SID and Email for each of them. 

- Finally, I assigned them the role ""ManageReport"", Viewer at the entity level and viewer (view the domain reports) at the level of the domains present in the entity.

 

A bit cumbersome as a process, would you have a simpler solution to submit to me?

Ideally a detailed solution for SAML integration with my WorkspaceOne IDP ?

 

Sincerely,

Hello Iulia,

I think no need to log file…

 

Tthe infrastructure has not changed, I am on the same servers.

I simply followed the recommendations of your colleague.

 

- Uninstalling the Pro version 

- Installing: dotnet-hosting-8.0.12-win.exe 

- Installing: pingcastle-enterprise-setup-3.3.0.3.msi the software points to the initial database and in IIS I reused the initial service account.

 

Finally, I configured the file: c:pingcastleEntrepriseappsettings.Production.json with the settings as below:

 



 

And the setting on the file: PingCastle.exe.config

 



 

 

When I log on to the website, I find my data. Moreover, when I execute my scheduled tasks, example bellow:

 



 

 

the reports go back well to the product.

 

I have two types of API AGENT associated with scheduled tasks by domain (I have to domain scheduled for the moment, so 4 tasks)

 

 



 

 

 

1.      2 tasks for “Upload report only” è with this kind of command:

 



 

! Report still Uploaded, but mail doesn’t received anymore !

 

2.      2 tasks for Read-only è with this kind of command:

 



 

 

 

No problem with this the reports is well sent to the address.

 

So, it’s just this kind of mail that was sent on “Upload reports”  that are no more received.

 



 

 

Hope it more clear for you. My problem is just that I didn’t receive anymore mail on task type: Upload report only

Brgds,

Hi David,

My name is Iulia and I am happy to assist you today.

The issue might be related to the email configuration or changes from the recent upgrade. Common causes include:


	Incorrect or reset SMTP settings (server, port, credentials).
	Changes in authentication requirements (e.g., OAuth).
	Incorrect or unread appsettings.Production.json file.
	Email delivery blocked by the provider (e.g., spam filters or IP blocklisting).


Could you please run PingCastle.exe --log a and share the logs with us? This will help us investigate further.
