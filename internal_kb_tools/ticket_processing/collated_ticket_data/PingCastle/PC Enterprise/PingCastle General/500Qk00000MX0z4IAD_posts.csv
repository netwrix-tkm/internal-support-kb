Good day!!

There is an issue with one of the stale object rules -- 
""Number of computers without password change for at least 3 months: 14""

Here the 14 accounts have changed the password recently but it is still showing as Vulnerability under stale Object rules.

NOTE -- It is showing future values for the computer accounts under last used.


please schedule a call so that we can discuss this issue as soon as possible.

please find the attached screenshot for your reference.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-03-04T09:22:34.000Z"

Additionally, some computer accounts display future timestamps under the last used attribute.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-03-17T08:30:50.000Z"

Observe that the rule ""Number of computers without password change for at least 3 months"" flags 14 computer accounts.
Verify that these accounts have recently updated their passwords.
Check the last used timestamps for these accounts and note that some show future values.
Attempt to validate the pwdLastSet and lastLogonTimestamp attributes in Active Directory.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-03-17T08:30:57.000Z"

PingCastle has built-in validation for future timestamps but may not be handling certain cases correctly.
Potential Causes:
Future Timestamps in AD – If timestamps are incorrect, PingCastle may misinterpret them.
Replication Delays – Out-of-sync domain controllers might be providing stale data.
Timezone or System Clock Issues – Inconsistent time settings on machines or domain controllers could skew timestamps.
Internal Logic Handling in PingCastle – Some scenarios might not be covered by its validation logic.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-03-17T08:31:08.000Z"

Run the following PowerShell command to confirm pwdLastSet and lastLogonTimestamp values:
Get-ADComputer -Filter * -Properties Name, pwdLastSet, lastLogonTimestamp | 
Where-Object { $_.Name -in @(""Computer1"", ""Computer2"", ...) } | 
Select-Object Name, pwdLastSet, lastLogonTimestamp
Verify Domain Controller Replication:
Run:
repadmin /showrepl
Ensure replication is functioning properly and data is consistent across DCs.
Test a Manual Password Reset for One Affected Computer:
If resetting the password updates the timestamp correctly, replication or time drift may be the root cause.
Check Domain Controller Time Synchronization:
Run:
w32tm /query /status
Identify any inconsistencies in time settings across DCs.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-03-17T08:31:37.000Z"
