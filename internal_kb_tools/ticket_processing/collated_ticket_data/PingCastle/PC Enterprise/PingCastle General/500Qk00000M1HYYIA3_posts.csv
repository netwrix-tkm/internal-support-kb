Hi have followed the good advices received by your service from Ticket#428974
Anyway, all seams ok, I have my scheduled AGENT TASK that still work fine.
When I execute one of them, the total of received report is well incremented.
But I still have one problem, I didn’t receive the reports by mail anymore.
Yet I have correctly configured the configuration file: ""<a href='https://appsettings.Production.json' target='_blank'>appsettings.Production.json</a>"" but nothing to do I do not receive the emails.
Can you help me on the subject, please?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-02-18T16:37:47.000Z"

Verified SMTP Configuration:
Checked appsettings.Production.json to confirm that the SMTP server settings (server, port, credentials) were correctly configured.
Ensured that authentication details were correctly provided and there were no syntax errors in the JSON file.
Performed Health Check on SMTP Server:
Verified that the SMTP server is reachable from the PingCastle server.
Confirmed that the SMTP connection test does not return any authentication failures or connection errors.
Manually Triggered an Agent Task:
Observed that the total count of received reports increases, confirming that report generation is functioning as expected.
Confirmed that reports are being generated and processed internally but are not being delivered via email.
Tested the Scenario in a Lab Environment:
Ran the same configuration in a controlled lab environment.
No issues were encountered in the lab setup, confirming that the problem is environment-specific.
Reviewed Possible Causes:
Considered potential authentication requirement changes (e.g., OAuth updates).
Checked whether the SMTP settings were reset or overwritten during the upgrade.
Evaluated whether the email provider is blocking emails due to spam filters or IP restrictions.
Provided Alternative Authentication Method (SAML):
Shared configuration details for SAML authentication as an alternative solution.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-03-13T13:06:47.000Z"
