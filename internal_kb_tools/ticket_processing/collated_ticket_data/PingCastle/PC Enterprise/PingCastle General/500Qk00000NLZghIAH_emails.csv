Apologies for the delay. After consulting with the PingCastle team,they are considering adding action plans to unify the views however this will be available in future updates.

Regarding Rule Logic Modification, this is not something the team are actively pursuing at the moment however it can be added to the future plans of PingCastle.

FYI, there is so specific timeline for these plans. The team are very thankful for all the things you have pointed out.

Thank you,
