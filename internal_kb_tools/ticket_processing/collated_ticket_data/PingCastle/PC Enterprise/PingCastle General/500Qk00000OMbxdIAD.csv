Good day!!


we installed the PCE agent for some domains on one server, now we want to move those to other servers.

can you please let me know how to proceed?

1. Do we need to uninstall on the current server and reinstall on the other server with the same API KEY and ENCRYPTION key?

2. Do we need to uninstall on the current server and reinstall on the other server with the new API KEY and ENCRYPTION key?

3. Is there any other way to migrate the PingCastle-deployed domains to other servers? 



Thanks,
Akhil","","","","Client has delayed the migration after giving instructions.
