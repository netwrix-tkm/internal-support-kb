### Installing fiddler
Can either get fiddler classic from the website https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler
or just use chocolatey if on VM

```
# Install chocolatey
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
# Install Fiddler
choco install fiddler
```

## Company information is not filled out
Packet 16 - URI: `/IProvisioningWebService/GetCompanyInformation` returned a 200 code but the body is an error stating `Company type cannot be read for client version`. It seems this may be to do with the ClientID `50afce61-c917-435b-8c6d-60aa5a8b8aa7` but it works in my lab ok. Maybe they have blocked access to that ClientID? Looks like the MSOL Service which is being deprecated by MS?

## Applications (ServicePrincipals) do not renew access tokens
Need to implement dynamic handling for expired access tokens. If you scroll down to around packet 18000 you'll see many 401 errors stating the access token has expired and needs to be renewed. This should be handled properly in the application.
