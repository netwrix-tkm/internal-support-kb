In one of our Active Directory domains PingCastle the alerts ""The LAN Manager Authentication Level allows the use of NTLMv1 or LM not being AND and ""Hardened Paths have been modified to lower the security level"" pops up.

We verified this GPO setting in our Policies within that AD domain, the settings exist and are set correctly. We do suspect that this is an issue with PingCastle not correctly/fully loading all Group Policy Objects from this domain so it can not verify that this setting exists.

The requested information is attached to this ticket","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-10T08:49:48.000Z"
