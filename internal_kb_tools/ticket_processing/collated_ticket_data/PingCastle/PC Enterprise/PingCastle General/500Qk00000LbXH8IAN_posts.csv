The issue appears to be related to how PingCastle processes Windows LAPS vs. Legacy LAPS data.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-02-26T14:58:12.000Z"

Run a PingCastle Enterprise scan.
Navigate to the LAPS reporting section within the unlocked report.
Observe that the report does not recognize Windows LAPS on Windows 10 devices.
Verify the LAPS Distribution Graph, which does recognize Windows LAPS but does not reflect it in other reporting areas.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-02-26T14:58:24.000Z"

The ""Number of LAPS Installed"" metric was designed for Legacy LAPS only.
The Excel export and dashboard pie charts did not factor in Windows LAPS.
The root cause was identified in how Windows LAPS data is retrieved and processed in the reports.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-02-26T14:58:42.000Z"

Column adjustments in the report:
Renamed “Number of LAPS Installed” to “Legacy LAPS”.
Added “Microsoft LAPS” column to track Windows LAPS separately.
Introduced a “Combined Total” column summing both values.
Updated pie charts to reflect Windows LAPS data properly.
The issue has been escalated and resolved in the latest release.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-02-26T14:58:55.000Z"
