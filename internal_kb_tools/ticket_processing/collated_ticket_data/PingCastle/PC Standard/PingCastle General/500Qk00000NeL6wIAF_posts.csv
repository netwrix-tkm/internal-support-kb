I have a question regarding using PingCastle for scanning Azure AD (Entra ID). I have created an account that I am using for scanning the environment and I assigned the <a href='https://Directory.Read.All' target='_blank'>Directory.Read.All</a> and <a href='https://Security.Read.All' target='_blank'>Security.Read.All</a> permissions to it. I have read on some forum on the internet, that these are enough for scanning it. But does not return any information about Azure AD.

I tried to find the info regarding what permissions the account that is being used needs, but I did not find anything. Is there any documentation from PingCastle available regarding how should the Azure AD scanning be set up? Or can you tell me exactly what permissions does the account, that we use to authenticate the PingCastle app, needs? 

Does it need more than <a href='https://Security.Read.All' target='_blank'>Security.Read.All</a> and <a href='https://Directory.Read.All' target='_blank'>Directory.Read.All</a>? Because it does not throw any error/warning and doesn't ask for additional access either. And we would like to avoid giving it access to everything, if it isn't necessary.

Thank you :)

Best regards,
Dominik Padych","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-03T13:49:56.000Z"
