Customer uses Windows LAPS in the cloud but PingCastle is reporting  the need to install LAPS.
He is trying to omit that from reports but there is no way to do it.

The Workaround is to generate the report with --level Full so the xml data contains all the data, edit the xml, then regenerate the report based on the xml data with the option --regen-report <file.xml>","0054u000007Mdn4AAC","2024-09-20T17:57:02.000Z","2024-09-20T17:57:02.000Z","false","false"
