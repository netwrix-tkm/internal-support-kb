That site only shows downloads up to version 3.3.0.1.

I am able to download and use version 3.3.0.8 from the My Products page.

Will the 48h license still work with v3.3.0.8?

 

Thank you

Hello Scott,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Emiliano and I’ll be the engineer assisting you with this ticket.

The option to create a 48hs license can be found accessing to the following link:
https://backend.pingcastle.com/Download/AskLicense 

There you should be able to add your license and after you can access, you will see the option to create a temporary license.

Please let me know if you have any question or if you are not able to do that.

Thank you!
Regards,

Emiliano Kraiñuk
Technical Support Engineer
