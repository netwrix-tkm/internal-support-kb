Hi Ali,

Thank you for your response.

Where can I find the trace.log file?
Also, the output in the report point to 2 domain controllers we have.

Checked the event logs, they are configured to audit logins, and I can see it in the results, but no events for builtin administrator account found.

What else can I check?

Thank you,
Liav

Where can I find the trace.log file?

Also, the output in the report point to 2 domain controllers we have.

 

Checked the event logs, they are configured to audit logins, and I can see it in the results, but no events for builtin administrator account found.

 

What else can I check?

 

Thank you,

Liav

Hi Liav,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

It would potentially be helpful to see the trace.log file for this using --log for more information. Also just seeing the output on the report would be usefult to.
 
This check queries the LastLogon attribute from all domainControllers and should output the domain controller name in the report if it was detected on a specific dc (the default behaviour). 
 
If for whatever reason it has fallenback to the previous behaviour it uses LastLogonTimestamp (the replicated version). 
 
If you have actually checked the event logs and cant see anything for the builtin administrator account (The rid -500) account then you may need to check your event logs to ensure that they are logging the correct events.
 
Logic can be seen here for checking the logs  https://github.com/netwrix/pingcastle/blob/2d9ab43ba1f4343f5daa983a840a7de08bf28378/Healthcheck/Rules/HeatlcheckRulePrivilegedAdminLogin.cs#L57

Thank you for your patience. 
We have investigated the logs and according to those, the account seems to be in use.



Here are the relevant log sections that show the DC it checked. Then it shows that the computation value is '0' meaning that it detected a 0 days totally as a difference between the generation date (when running the report) and the time of the last logon.

Hello German,

Thank you for the quick response!
I'm trying to figure out where is the administrator account is used, but I have double checked and it's not being used for at least a week.
There is no services, opened sessions or any software that use this account.

Also, I tried to search for event ID 4624 and found nothing in both DC servers.

[cid:image001.png@01DB44F8.3B784EC0]

However, whenever I run the query you mentioned, I get the same time as the query started.
Also, I found out the LastLogonTimestamp value is about a week ago, but the LastLogon value is now...
I really don't understand what is going on.

The difference between LastLogonTimestamp and LastLogon is that the first one is replicated version of the latter, it replicates between DCs every 14 days which explains why you have it showing 25/11. LastLogon is not replicated so it shows the most recently updated value only on the DC that authenticated the logon. Our product is looking at LastLogon attribute to report the most accurate data.

I may recommend to look for logon events on that one DC that has the most recent LastLogon attribute value. You may find more info in this MS article: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/technet-wiki/22461.understanding-the-ad-account-attributes-lastlogon-lastlogontimestamp-and-lastlogondate

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Hi Ali,

 

Thank you for your response.

 

Where can I find the trace.log file?

Also, the output in the report point to 2 domain controllers we have.

 

Checked the event logs, they are configured to audit logins, and I can see it in the results, but no events for builtin administrator account found.

 

What else can I check?

 

Thank you,

Liav

Hi Liav,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support.

It would potentially be helpful to see the trace.log file for this using --log for more information. Also just seeing the output on the report would be usefult to.
 
This check queries the LastLogon attribute from all domainControllers and should output the domain controller name in the report if it was detected on a specific dc (the default behaviour). 
 
If for whatever reason it has fallenback to the previous behaviour it uses LastLogonTimestamp (the replicated version). 
 
If you have actually checked the event logs and cant see anything for the builtin administrator account (The rid -500) account then you may need to check your event logs to ensure that they are logging the correct events.
 
Logic can be seen here for checking the logs  https://github.com/netwrix/pingcastle/blob/2d9ab43ba1f4343f5daa983a840a7de08bf28378/Healthcheck/Rules/HeatlcheckRulePrivilegedAdminLogin.cs#L57
