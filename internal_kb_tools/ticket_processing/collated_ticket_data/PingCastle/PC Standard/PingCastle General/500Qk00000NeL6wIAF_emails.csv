We are currently using the depecated MSOnline API, AzureAD APIs, Graph and some other less obvious ones. The permissions you mentioned are just the graph API ones and hence, you cannot delegate accesses to the others any longer. It is recommended to just run an interactive scan until we complete these migrations.

The build in the next couple of weeks will migrate the provisioning API (MSOnline) to graph.

Please let me know if this helps. Moreover, you can visit the following link to get more context of it: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft-entra-blog/action-required-msonline-and-azuread-powershell-retirement---2025-info-and-resou/4364991

Hi,

I guess we can close the ticket. We will wait for 3-4 weeks and track the PingCastle release news. If there won't be any news in a month, then I will just raise a new ticket to get an update regarding the state of the migration to graph.

By the way do you already know what permissions will be needed for using graph? Or will a recommendation be included in the release update at least? (You can close the ticket after answering these)

Thank you.
