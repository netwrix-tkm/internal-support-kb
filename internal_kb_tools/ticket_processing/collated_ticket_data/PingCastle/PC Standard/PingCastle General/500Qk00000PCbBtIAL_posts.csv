I had logged a previous ticket about connecting to Azure with pingcastle using App Registrations., I believe you've now updated to graph API, so this may now work.

Do you have any documentation on how to connect to Azure/Entra using App Registrations please – and a note of all API permissions required in the App registration that would allow Pingcastle to connect to and scan Azure/Entra?

Also, if required to connect manually as a user, a note of the roles required to fully scan Azure/entra would be useful.

We’d like to be able to configure this so we do not need to manually enter details (scheduled task etc).","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-15T14:22:28.000Z"
