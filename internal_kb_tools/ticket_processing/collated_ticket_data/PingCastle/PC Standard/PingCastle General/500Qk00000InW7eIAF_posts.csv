I ran the tool, and found out a section ""Check for Native administrator usage - recently used: 0 days ago"".
However, I checked event viewer for all DC servers, services and task scheduler, the native administrator is not used at all.

How can I solve this section?

Thank you,
Liav","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2024-11-26T07:22:48.000Z"
