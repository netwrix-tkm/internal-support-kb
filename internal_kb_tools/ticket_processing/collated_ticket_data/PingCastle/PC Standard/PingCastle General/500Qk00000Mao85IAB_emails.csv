Thank you for your confirmation. Based on our findings:

	Issue: The PingCastle Standard license was initially not visible in ""My Products"".
	Cause: Likely a portal synchronization delay or temporary display issue.
	Resolution: The product and license are now visible, and no further action is required.


Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return. In addition, you will also receive a separate email with a survey where you can let us know how we did. Feel free to leave any feedback via the survey link!
