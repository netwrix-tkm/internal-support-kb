"500Qk00000P3ooKIAR","00444779","Support Ticket","Pingcastle highlights issues in reports that should not appear","Recently pingcastle that we are running for On-prem triggered the rule 'Presence of unknown account in delegation' on 28th April. We reviewed the alert and found this alert to be false positive as the delegated account is coming from trusted domain and it is resolving properly in the domain where the rule was triggered. It is known account and I do not understand the reason why pingcastle thinks it is foreign. There is no issue with trust relationship between these two domains and no recent changes were done.","","","","There is an intermittent DNS issue on user's end and they will be working with their local IT to get it resolved.","Backend Server Fix","Shaheryar Ali Tahir","Unexpected Behavior","PingCastle","PC Standard","PingCastle General","3.3","","7.9","Closed - Resolved","AXAXL","Maciej Mrowiec","2025-05-12T13:14:07.000Z","2025-05-20T09:58:57.000Z"
