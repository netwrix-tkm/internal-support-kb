"500Qk00000FvWIgIAN","00421365","Support Ticket","Obsolete Windows editions","I ran a scan on a customer and one of the items flagged was for obsolete Windows editions. Ping Castle showed me that there were five ""active"" devices running unsupported versions but did not show me the actual device names. It told me to run the Ping Castle AD Computer report or a powershell command. Two problems: The AD computer report keeps corrupting and will bunch all the items on one line in the csv not thus not allowing me too filter in excel. The second is, the powershell command provided does not show the ""Active"" attribute which is the key that Ping Castle uses to find the computers that need to be remediated. How is Ping Castle getting this information?","","","","Client: ""I think this one is figured out. I didn't realize the reports were tab delimited and not comma delimited.""","","Elizaveta Presniakova","","PingCastle","PC Standard","PingCastle General","3.2.0.1","","19.7","Closed - Resolved","Fortress SRM","Jordan Schwieso","2024-09-18T12:50:41.000Z","2024-10-08T04:55:20.000Z"
