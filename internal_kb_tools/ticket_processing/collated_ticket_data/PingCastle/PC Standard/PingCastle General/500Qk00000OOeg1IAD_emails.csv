Apologies for the confusion. What I meant was the drive that PingCastle was installed on and find the file web.config.

Hi Uddin,

I consulted this internally and it turned out this could not be fixed until  Azure AD module will be upgraded to PowerShell Graph module. Please close the ticket, since there is no workaround..

Thanks.

[CAUTION EXTERNAL]

Hello Maciej,

I’m reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven’t heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00443015
Ticket Subject: Pingcastle Azure Reports
Ticket Details: We recently ran pingcastle in the cloud (Azure AD) and the domain risk level shows 0/100. I'm not sure if pingcastle is scanning our prod tenants properly, but it seems overly optimistic to have a tenant risk score of zero. Only one informative rule was highlighted to look at.
Can you confirm what specifically pingcastle (in the auditor license) scans within the Azure environment? Need to consult this.

Thank you!

Thank you for the update. The following is a summary of the ticket for your records.

Issues/Concerns:


	Ran PingCastle in the cloud (Azure AD).
	Domain risk level shows 0/100, which seems overly optimistic.
	Only one informative rule was highlighted.
	Confirm what PingCastle (auditor license) scans within the Azure environment.
	Consult on the accuracy of the scan results for production tenants



Resolution
Cannot be fixed until Azure AD module is upgraded to Powershell Graph module.

Following this email, you will receive an automated confirmation that the case is closed, along with the ability to re-open the case if any related errors return.
