We have this script that runs PingCastle scans against regular AD every day. We want to implement a scan for Azure AD as well. But when we tested it manually, it is not really giving us any relevant information. As you can see from the attached report, we can see some information being collected, but the score is 0/100 and no rules are being matched.

Here is some info about the manual testing environment that we have set up:
1. I have downloaded the latest version 3.3.0.11 of PingCastle through the link listed in this post <a href='https://community.netwrix.com/t/patch-version-3-3-0-11/8903' target='_blank'>https://community.netwrix.com/t/patch-version-3-3-0-11/8903</a>

2. As can be seen in the report we are using the Auditor Edition license.

3. We used our Azure Admin's account for the test run, so that we make sure there is no restriction due to lack of permissions.

Do you have any idea what could be the cause why it is not showing any score and no rules are being matched? 
Are the rules for Azure AD included automatically in PingCastle or do we need to download them from somewhere separately and make them available for PingCastle somehow?
And is the Auditor Edition license enough for the Azure AD scan to work or is a different type of a license required?

Thank you.

Best regards,
Dominik Padych","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-12T13:02:07.000Z"
