Thank you. That version does have a current/valid certificate.
But, for your information, if you run pingcastleautoupdater.exe from that v3.3.0.8 it downgrades both executables to 3.3.0.1.

Thanks for the update. 

That is expected right now. This is because autoupdater master is from GitHub and that is going to be updated soon.

Please let me know if you have any question or if there is anything else I can help you with.
