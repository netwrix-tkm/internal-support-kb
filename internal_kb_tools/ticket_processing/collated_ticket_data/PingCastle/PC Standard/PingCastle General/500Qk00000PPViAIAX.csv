"500Qk00000PPViAIAX","00445795","Support Ticket","Unsupportet program","Hi,
we use the pingcastle 3.3.0.1 for auditing.
Today i downloaded version 3.3.0.11 with the same license key.
When i start the software, i got the message ""The program is unsupportet since: 2025-05-17 00:00:00Z).
Do we need a new license? We renewd it a few month ago.
Thanx
Christian","","","","License was not propogating when downloading PingCastle version 3.3.0.11. After updating the application using the auto-updater, the issue was resolved.","Deployment/Installation","Shaheryar Ali Tahir","Request","PingCastle","PC Standard","PingCastle General","3.3","","1.4","Closed - Resolved","Kufgem GmbH","Christian Steindl","2025-05-21T05:54:58.000Z","2025-05-22T14:30:21.000Z"
