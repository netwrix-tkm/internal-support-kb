We reviewed the alert and found this alert to be false positive as the delegated account is coming from trusted domain and it is resolving properly in the domain where the rule was triggered. It is known account and I do not understand the reason why pingcastle thinks it is foreign. There is no issue with trust relationship between these two domains and no recent changes were done.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-12T13:14:08.000Z"
