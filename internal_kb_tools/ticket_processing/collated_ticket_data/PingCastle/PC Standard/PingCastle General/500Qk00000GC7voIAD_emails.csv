Hello Jordan,

I wanted to check with you, if you are able to run the healthcheck in version 3.3 instead of 3.2.0.1. You should be able to get it from https://backend.pingcastle.com/Download/AskLicense adding your license there. 
If the result is the same, please send me the trace log for it.

Thank you!

Hello Jordan,

I’m reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven’t heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00421962
Ticket Subject: Hardened Paths
Ticket Details: Hello, I have run an AD Health scan multiple times and the Hardened Paths continues to pop up. The customer has a GPO currently implemented at the top of the domain configuring hardened paths. Why does PC say there are no GPOs created?

Thank you!

In your screenshot for hardened UNC paths, I am not sure the quotes around each item is the expected.

MS15-011: Vulnerability in Group Policy could allow remote code execution: February 10, 2015 - Microsoft Support

In the Value column, type the name of the security property to configure (for example, type RequireMutualAuthentication, RequireIntegrity, or RequirePrivacy) followed by an equal sign (=) and the number 0 or 1. 

Note Multiple properties may be assigned for a single UNC path by separating each ""<Property> = <Value>"" pair by using a comma (,).




All of this is from that above link.

Hello Jordan,

I wanted to check with you, if you are able to run the healthcheck in version 3.3 instead of 3.2.0.1. You should be able to get it from https://backend.pingcastle.com/Download/AskLicense adding your license there. 
If the result is the same, please send me the trace log for it.

Thank you!

MS15-011: Vulnerability in Group Policy could allow remote code execution: February 10, 2015 - Microsoft Support

Hi Jordan,

In your screenshot for hardened UNC paths, I am not sure the quotes around each item is the expected.

MS15-011: Vulnerability in Group Policy could allow remote code execution: February 10, 2015 - Microsoft Support<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/ms15-011-vulnerability-in-group-policy-could-allow-remote-code-execution-february-10-2015-91b4bda2-945d-455b-ebbb-01d1ec191328>

In the Value column, type the name of the security property to configure (for example, type RequireMutualAuthentication, RequireIntegrity, or RequirePrivacy) followed by an equal sign (=) and the number 0 or 1.

Note Multiple properties may be assigned for a single UNC path by separating each ""<Property> = <Value>"" pair by using a comma (,).

Hello Jordan,

I wanted to check with you, if you are able to run the healthcheck in version 3.3 instead of 3.2.0.1. You should be able to get it from https://backend.pingcastle.com/Download/AskLicense adding your license there.
If the result is the same, please send me the trace log for it.

Thank you!

Hello Jordan,

I'm reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven't heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you're all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out-I'm here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00421962
Ticket Subject: Hardened Paths
Ticket Details: Hello, I have run an AD Health scan multiple times and the Hardened Paths continues to pop up. The customer has a GPO currently implemented at the top of the domain configuring hardened paths. Why does PC say there are no GPOs created?

Thank you!
