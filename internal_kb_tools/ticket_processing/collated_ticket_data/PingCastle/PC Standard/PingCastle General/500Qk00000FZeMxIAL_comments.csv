"00aQk000009dpboIAA","500Qk00000FZeMxIAL","It seems they have an issue with a few of their computers Last Logon Dates (Actually, LastLogonTimestamp from the DC Scanned – shown here: https://github.com/netwrix/pingcastle/blob/master/Healthcheck/Healthcheck.cs#L466 ) being set in the future.
This skews the finding as it is doing the following calculation  (PasswordLastSet + 45 days) < Last Logon, as shown here: https://github.com/netwrix/pingcastle/blob/502535913aa774c9be6cd24fdcabc894436f005b/Healthcheck/Rules/HeatlcheckRuleStaledPwdLastSet45.cs#L26 .

You can verify the LastLogonTimestamp dates by either:

Using Active Directory Users and Computers
Enabling advanced features
Navigating to the OU of the affected Computer
Opening the properties of said computer
selecting Attribute Editor tab
browsing to the lastlogondate / lastlogontimestamp to investigate
Using PowerShell with the Active Directory Module and running the following (Replacing the SAMaccountName for each computer affected)
Get-ADComputer -Filter { SAMAccountName -eq “MTYAPS0166$” } -properties *  | Select Name, LastLogonDate, @{ Name = ""LastLogonTimestamp""; Expression = { [datetime]::FromFileTime($_.LastLogonTimestamp) } }, PasswordLastSet



The specific check mentioned will have the advised solution for when a password is actually not been changed. This is an active directory/windows bug that is causing the LastLogonTimestamp to be in the future so there is no specific vulnerability here. That being said here are some steps which may help:

-Check the time on the server itself, there was a bug in windows that can set dates to the future which then may translate to the LastLogonTimestamp being updated. https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/08/windows-feature-that-resets-system-clocks-based-on-random-data-is-wreaking-havoc/

-Clear the lastLogonTimestamp/LastLogon for the affected system or set it to an older value and then login (or maybe restart) the affected system to try and get it to update to a newer value","0054u000007Mdn4AAC","2024-10-14T10:33:28.000Z","2024-10-14T10:33:28.000Z","false","false"
