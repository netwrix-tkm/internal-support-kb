"500Qk00000GTpcEIAT","00422522","Support Ticket","Consolidation","We are currently running Pingcastle – auditor on 3 domains, and also the open source edition on a couple of domains

We wamt to comsolidate the reports – and are in doubt if we need the enterprise version for that, or if we could stay on auditor (we need the MITRE tools from that version) and then just consolidate the reports.

Please advice

We have in total 12-15 domains, where pingcastle is currently running In 5 of them","","","","You may use the 'conso' feature in the open-source edition to run the consolidation of the health check reports. Otherwise, if you'd like to have access to more feature like action plans, exceptions, trends etc, then we suggest using the Enterprise version.

Question: But would that require the all reports are generated from the same Pingcastle source exe file ?
Or can they run in totally separate (and disconnected) domains in OT for instance?

>> or the 'conso' report you need to place all the xml files for all domains in the PingCastle directory and it will consolidate them.
Just copy and paste the reports into the same folder after generation.","","Ali Asif","","PingCastle","PC Standard","PingCastle General","3.2.0.1","","9.2","Closed - Resolved","Arlafoods","Thomas Olesen","2024-10-01T08:48:51.000Z","2024-10-10T14:06:26.000Z"
