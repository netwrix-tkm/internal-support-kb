I'm not sure if pingcastle is scanning our prod tenants properly, but it seems overly optimistic to have a tenant risk score of zero. Only one informative rule was highlighted to look at.
Can you confirm what specifically pingcastle (in the auditor license) scans within the Azure environment? Need to consult this.","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-04-24T06:53:44.000Z"
