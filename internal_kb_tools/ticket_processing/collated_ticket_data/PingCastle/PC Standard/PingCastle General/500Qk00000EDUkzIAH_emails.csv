Thank you for your patience.

If “runas” is not working (the workstation must belong to the domain or a trusted domain) PingCastle has no chance to work.
We also discourage to use “—user” as GPO are prohibited due to the SYSVOL hardening that requires integrity (which is causing problem with impersonation that PingCastle is using)

Another solution is to shift – right click to display a context menu to run the program under another identity.

Let me know if this helps.

Hello Fabian,

Thank you for your patience.

--user is known to have problem.
We need to use “runas” to avoid that GPO issue.

Dear Ali,

thanks for the feedback and the advice. Unfortunately, it does not match what we intend to do.
We involved Microsoft Windows Server product team for evaluating GPO access across non-domain joined scenarios for proceeding with our intention. It might be the case that centralized scanning of ADs is not possible due to UNC path hardening.

I’ll be on leave till next year and want to thank you for your support, which is highly appreciated. As of now, I don’t know where the strategy for AD is moving us to, but I’ll keep Netwrix and Le Toux positively in my mind. I wish you calm holidays and a good shift to 2025!

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Ticket Number: 00417657
Ticket Subject: Ping Castle: Wrong User/Pass for GPO, only
Ticket Details: Dear Ping Castle Team,

I tested the community edition for Ping Castle 3.2.0.1 and noticed following error in <a href='https://trace.log<https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/trace.log__;!!F5aLKg!maPxG3UYeNg0Opv322HTVVQKkkBFs2wjFDIZufap4WNULlgduH3M8vMrV2GseKSFVoVUInocFbhVWXL52-JyoR1BBnSuDj11$>' target='_blank'>trace.log</a>.

Ping Castle is started via following script (so you know the parameters):

I noticed GPO access denied in v2.9.2.0 when passing creds with user argument · Issue #80 · netwrix/pingcastle · GitHub, where an equal issue occured.

Any idea, why this error happens?

Thank you!
