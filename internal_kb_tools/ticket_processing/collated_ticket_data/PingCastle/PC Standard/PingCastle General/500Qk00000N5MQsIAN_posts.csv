I left one scan running overnight and it still hadn’t got past that step the next morning.
Today, I have enabled logging for each scan and all of them are getting stuck at “Gathering gpo data”. We were running version 3.2.0.1 when I saw the issue, but even when running 3.3.0.1 I get the same issue.

Please see below for the relevant trace log extracts. It looks like it’s scanning GPOs for MSIs and timing out but then starting the scan all over again when it reconnects. The strange thing is that we have never had this issue before and our monthly scan on 1st March ran successfully.
