"500Qk00000O1JvfIAF","00441847","Support Ticket","New License Not Showing Up","Hello,
We (SEC Consult) are long term PingCastle customers. As Pingcastle got acquired by Netwrix, we bought Pingcastle for the first time via Netwrix. This was done by our Software Distributor Netsense. (Purchase Order:  3700355359). I received the license via Email by our distributor and the information that we can download the software via <a href='https://netwrix.com' target='_blank'>netwrix.com</a>. I logged into <a href='https://netwrix.com' target='_blank'>netwrix.com</a> with the same email the product was bought for (<a href='https://w.schober@sec-consult.com' target='_blank'>w.schober@sec-consult.com</a>) Sadly my product list is empty and i cannot download Pingcastle.

Please support us here as we need the software asap.
