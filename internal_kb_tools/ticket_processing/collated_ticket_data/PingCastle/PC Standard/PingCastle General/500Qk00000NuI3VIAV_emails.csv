Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. My name is Emiliano and I’ll be the engineer assisting you with this ticket.

Could you please send me a screenshot of what you are seeing in the package?
I downloaded the package and unzipped it now to check, and I'm able to see the PingCastle.exe.config file.




Inside that file, you need to find this:

 <LicenseSettings

And insert your license there.

Please let me know if you have any question and send me a screenshot of what you see in the folder.

Thank you!

Hi,

Ok, I finally managed to get the file pingcastle.exe.config, but the license key we got from you was already injected in the required field <LicenseSettings
    license="""" />.

[cid:image001.png@01DBAACA.DDB47AF0]

[cid:image002.png@01DBAACB.58504460]

I removed it and inserted the license key again and saved the file. How do I manage run the usual html reports for each domain we have at our company, as this is our objective?

Hello Maciej,

I’m reaching out to see if the instructions I sent in my last email helped resolve the issue you were experiencing. I haven’t heard back from you, so I wanted to check if everything is working smoothly now or if you still need further assistance.

If you’re all set, just let me know, and I can close the ticket. If you still need help or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m here to support you.

Looking forward to your response!

Ticket Number: 00441611
Ticket Subject: Issue with license activation
Ticket Details: Hello, we received instructions from your team on how to activate the license key for our Pingcastle tool. Unfortunately, after downloading the pingcastle package, I did not see the <a href='https://PingCastle.exe' target='_blank'>PingCastle.exe</a>.config file where, according to your instructions, I should put the key. Can you please guide me how to do it?

Thank you!

Emiliano Krainuk
Technical Support Engineer
