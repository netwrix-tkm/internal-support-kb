I wrote a PowerShell-Script for ""Stale Objects -> Obsolete OS (Windows 10 or Windows 11)"" That simplifies the output a little, so that the user won't have to open the output file via Excel, that is being generated via the Main Menu.

Reason for this: This is usually being run on a Domain Controller, which sometimes makes it hard for an Admin to properly evaluate the output - sometimes he can't copy/paste, share the file etc. due to restrictions.

My question here is, if I can submit this to be used by other users - I have seen, there are sometimes link to repositories in solutions. 

Best
