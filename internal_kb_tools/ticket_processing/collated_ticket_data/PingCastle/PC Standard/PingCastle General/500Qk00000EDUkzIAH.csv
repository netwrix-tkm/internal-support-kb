I tested the community edition for Ping Castle 3.2.0.1 and noticed following error in <a href='https://trace.log' target='_blank'>trace.log</a>.
Login works successfully using <a href='https://username@example.com' target='_blank'>username@example.com</a> and Password.

Ping Castle is started via following script (so you know the parameters):

I noticed GPO access denied in v2.9.2.0 when passing creds with user argument · Issue #80 · netwrix/pingcastle · GitHub, where an equal issue occured.
 
Any idea, why this error happens?","","","","If “runas” is not working (the workstation must belong to the domain or a trusted domain) PingCastle has no chance to work.
We also discourage to use “—user” as GPO are prohibited due to the SYSVOL hardening that requires integrity (which is causing problem with impersonation that PingCastle is using)

Another solution is to shift – right click to display a context menu to run the program under another identity.","","Ali Asif","","PingCastle","PC Standard","PingCastle General","3.2.0.1","","122.0","Closed - Resolved","Lhind DLH","Fabian Schroedter","2024-08-09T08:40:35.000Z","2024-12-09T07:41:47.000Z"
