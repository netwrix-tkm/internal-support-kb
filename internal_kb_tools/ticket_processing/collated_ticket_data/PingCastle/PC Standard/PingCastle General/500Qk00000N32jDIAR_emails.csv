 Thank you for contact Netwrix Support.  Currently, it is not possible to manage your organizations users on the Netwrix Customer Portal.  When a person registers to use our Customer portal they are associated with the account of the same domain as the user's email address. Similarly, licenses are displayed in the Customer Portal based on that account association.

I will pass your request to be able to manage your organization's access to the customer portal to be considered as a future enhancement.

Please let us know if there is anything else we can assist with?

Thank you,

Brandon West

Hi Jakob,

We are currently undergoing a redesign of our Portal and I have provided your request to be able to control access for your account to the team on this project.

Until that time, if you would like to provide me with a list of people who should have access we can remove any other person with your email domain from the portal.

Thank you,

Okay, so basically you are saying any employee with the same domain prefix, in this case @aevengroup.com<https://aevengroup.com/>, will, after they are created on the customer portal, have access to ALL the licensing purchase under this domain?

What is we, the company, do not want just anybody with a company domain email address to have access to ALL licensing/software purchase by netwrix?
