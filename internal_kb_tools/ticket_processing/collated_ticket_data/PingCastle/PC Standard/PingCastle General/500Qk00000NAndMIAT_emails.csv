Hi,
I have attached a zip file. There are 4 files inside
Conf_file - PingCastle.exe.conf where the license is applied
Healthcheck_console_output - direct console output when running healthcheck on PingCastle.exe
Healthcheck_trace_log - log file that was created by the --log argument
Script_logs - there are 2 examples of logs created by our custom script. There you can see that last year it was running fine with the ol license. We got a renewal license in January, but it fails to run and runs in a Free version instead.

The zip file is password protected. You can retrieve the password from here. Note: The password will be deleted from the database once you access it, so either store the password or keep the files extracted.
https://upass.services.usu.com/#/s/c3d3e7f2-e2c0-48a7-b451-19f22ae3adad/y6qhQiJtXknuSVCr9YW44l

If you need any other outputs, please just let me know what arguments to use and I will run PingCastle again and provide the outputs to you.

Apologies for they delay. We have reached out to our PingCastle team and reviewed the logs. They have mentioned that as long as the report has the maturity assessment, the license should be working as normal. They did mention this was a slight bug in the software, but they have assured it should work as normal.

If you have anymore questions please let me know.

Thank you,

Hi,
I had a look through the logs I have sent to you again and I don't know how did they assume that there is a maturity assessment, because I did not find a single mention about it being included. And if it was there, then I wouldn't have raised this ticket.

I have attached 2 files. OldReport.png and TodaysReport.png, where you can see that in the old report, where the old license was used, it says that Auditor Edition was used to generate the report and Maturity Level is present. But in the today's report, where the new license is being used, it says it used Basic Edition to generate the report and Maturity Level is not included

Can you run this command in the console:

Let me know if this shows something different.

Hi,

What do you mean by running Pingcastle.exe.config in the console? Pingcastle.exe.config is being used by Pingcastle by default. Pingcastle.exe.conf doesn't even exist in the installation folder. So if I tried to use that one, it would result in an error.

Apologies for the confusion. PingCastle download should contain this file in the folder (see below). Open this file using Notepad++ or similar and edit the field for the license and add your license to it (see below). Once this is done, it should then run as the licensed version.

Also, just to clarify which version of PingCastle have you installed? You need to have the basic version installed first before upgrading it to the standard license. The basic version is the only version that will have the pingcastle.exe.config file.

(Link to the basic edition is below)

Release PingCastle 3.3.0.1 · netwrix/pingcastle · GitHub

I have uploaded ConfigFile.txt to the ticket. That is how our Pingcastle.exe.config file is currently set up. You can see that the license is applied there.

We are running the PingCastle 3.3.0.1 basic version

Could you please check internally with your teams, if the license we got from you is actually valid?

Hi,

We have a ticket from USU Software AG where they have said their license is not working. After some investigating and testing it seems that the license is not functioning correctly. Can we provide a new standard license to them?

Thank you,

Rej Uddin

Hi,
I have uploaded ConfigFile.txt to the ticket. That is how our Pingcastle.exe.config file is currently set up. You can see that the license is applied there.

We are running the PingCastle 3.3.0.1 basic version

Could you please check internally with your teams, if the license we got from you is actually valid?

In case the license itself is not enough for you to search for it. The company name is USU Software AG. If you need more info to check the license validity, please let me know.

Thank you.
