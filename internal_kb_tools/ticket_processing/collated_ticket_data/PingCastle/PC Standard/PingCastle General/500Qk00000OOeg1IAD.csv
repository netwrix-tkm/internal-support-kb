"500Qk00000OOeg1IAD","00443015","Support Ticket","Pingcastle Azure Reports","We recently ran pingcastle in the cloud (Azure AD) and the domain risk level shows 0/100. I'm not sure if pingcastle is scanning our prod tenants properly, but it seems overly optimistic to have a tenant risk score of zero. Only one informative rule was highlighted to look at.
Can you confirm what specifically pingcastle (in the auditor license) scans within the Azure environment? Need to consult this.","","","","Customer requested the ticket to be closed as they need to upgrade their AzureAD module to the Powershell Graph module before this can be fixed.","Backend Server Fix","Rejaul Uddin","Question","PingCastle","PC Standard","PingCastle General","3.3","","5.0","Closed - Resolved","AXAXL","Maciej Mrowiec","2025-04-24T06:53:43.000Z","2025-04-29T07:46:23.000Z"
