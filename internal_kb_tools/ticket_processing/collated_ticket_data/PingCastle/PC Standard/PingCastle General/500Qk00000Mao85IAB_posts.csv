The customer rechecked the ""My Products"" section, and the license became visible.
This suggests that either a portal synchronization delay or a temporary display issue caused the problem.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-03-11T07:58:44.000Z"

If the problem recurs, the customer should try logging out and back in, or clearing their browser cache.
If the license disappears again, we may need to investigate potential account synchronization issues.","","","","005Qk000003YNwXIAW","2025-03-11T07:58:52.000Z"
