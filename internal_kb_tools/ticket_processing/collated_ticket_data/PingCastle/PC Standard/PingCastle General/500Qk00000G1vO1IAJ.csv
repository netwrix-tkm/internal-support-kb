"500Qk00000G1vO1IAJ","00421626","Support Ticket","A-DCLdapSign does not recognise signing configuration","We have configured our Domain Controllers (DC) to Require Signing for LDAP, but the PingCastle report fails to recognise the configuration in all DCs. The GPO is properly applied and the correct registry key with value is also present on every domain controller. How can we make sure that PingCastle is able to recognise that signing is configured? What else is missing? Is this a bug?","","","","Symptom
PingCastle reporting that Signing for LDAP is not required.


Resolution
There was an older GPO overriding the signing configuration setting the value to None. 
Tested reconfiguring one DC and the PingCastle report correctly reflected the status of signing requirement. 
The PingCastle report was accurate.","","Emiliano Krainuk","","PingCastle","PC Standard","PingCastle General","3.2.0.1","","26.1","Closed - Resolved","Accenture Services s.r.o.","Nimantha Galhenage","2024-09-20T09:13:58.000Z","2024-10-16T11:44:16.000Z"
