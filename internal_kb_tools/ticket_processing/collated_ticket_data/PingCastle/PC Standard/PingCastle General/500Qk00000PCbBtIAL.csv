I had logged a previous ticket about connecting to Azure with pingcastle using App Registrations., I believe you've now updated to graph API, so this may now work.

Do you have any documentation on how to connect to Azure/Entra using App Registrations please – and a note of all API permissions required in the App registration that would allow Pingcastle to connect to and scan Azure/Entra?

Also, if required to connect manually as a user, a note of the roles required to fully scan Azure/entra would be useful.

We’d like to be able to configure this so we do not need to manually enter details (scheduled task etc).","","","","Question on scheduling Scan of Azure using an App Registration.
Customer was informed that configuring a scheduled Scan of Azure using an App Registration is not possible as of now even though all the switches are there because the accounts still use the old azure graph.windows.net api at this stage. We are in the process of completely migrating to Graph API. Once we migrate everything to the graph api (which is scheduled in a release later this year) this may be possible.","Best Practices Question","Shaheryar Ali Tahir","Question","PingCastle","PC Standard","PingCastle General","3.3","","11.0","Closed - Resolved","AXAXL","Neil Patterson","2025-05-15T14:22:26.000Z","2025-05-26T14:09:05.000Z"
