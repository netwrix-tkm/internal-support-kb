my factual and unemotional reply to your mail:

I can't understand why a company name change should have such a massive impact on the license. After all, the domain has not changed!
So why does the program no longer accept the license after it has been updated?
Why don't we get a modified license with a modified term as an alternative?
Why does the communication take so long (in the meantime the problem was set to closed by Netwrix Support and only set to open again by us after another email)?

Hi Dirk,

I want to update you on the current status of reissuing your Ping Castle license.  

The issue is rooted in the name change of your business that occurred during the last renewal cycle.  I have the appropriate teams making the needed adjustments now.

I am very sorry for the delay. This change has required many people to be involved.

Can you update me on the status of Ping Castle, Is it fully inoperable? Are you able to use any portion of it?

Thank you,

Hi Dirk,

I have acquired a new license for you, which is attached. This license should be applied now and provide all the functionality you are entitled to. This license is valid for 30 days while we work out the records issues to issue the full term license. I will provide the full term license as soon as it is available.

I apologize for the long delay and the inconvenience.

Thank you,

my factual and unemotional reply to your mail:

I can't understand why a company name change should have such a massive impact on the license. After all, the domain has not changed!
So why does the program no longer accept the license after it has been updated?
Why don't we get a modified license with a modified term as an alternative?
Why does the communication take so long (in the meantime the problem was set to closed by Netwrix Support and only set to open again by us after another email)?

Hi Dirk,

I want to update you on the current status of reissuing your Ping Castle license.

The issue is rooted in the name change of your business that occurred during the last renewal cycle.  I have the appropriate teams making the needed adjustments now.

I am very sorry for the delay. This change has required many people to be involved.

Can you update me on the status of Ping Castle, Is it fully inoperable? Are you able to use any portion of it?

Thank you,

Brandon West
