"500Qk00000Mao85IAB","00437817","Support Ticket","Not see my license in Portal -> My Products","The customer reported that they were unable to see their Netwrix PingCastle Standard license in the ""My Products"" section of the portal.","Customer logged into the Netwrix Customer Portal.
Navigated to ""My Products"" under their account.
Expected to see their PingCastle Standard license listed but did not find it.
Opened a support ticket to investigate.","After verifying account details, the license was confirmed to be active.
The customer rechecked the ""My Products"" section, and the license became visible.
This suggests that either a portal synchronization delay or a temporary display issue caused the problem.","No further action needed, as the issue is now resolved.
If the problem recurs, the customer should try logging out and back in, or clearing their browser cache.
If the license disappears again, we may need to investigate potential account synchronization issues.","Customer confirmed that the license now appears under ""My Products"".
The ticket can be closed.","License: technical question","Iulia Apatachioaei","Question","PingCastle","PC Standard","PingCastle General","3.1.0.1","","5.6","Closed - Resolved","ELAT s.r.o.","Robert Schindler","2025-03-05T16:40:49.000Z","2025-03-11T08:00:37.000Z"
