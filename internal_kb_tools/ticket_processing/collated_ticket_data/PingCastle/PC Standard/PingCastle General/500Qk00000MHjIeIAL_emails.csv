Dear Atif,

Following up on our meeting, I am providing further details regarding the findings related to Hardened UNC Paths and Protected Users, along with the recommended mitigation steps.

	Hardened Paths Have Been Modified to Lower the Security Level

This finding indicates that the Hardened UNC Paths policy has been altered, reducing protection for SYSVOL and NETLOGON shares. This increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential manipulation of Group Policy settings.

-To mitigate this, the policy should be correctly enforced through Group Policy Management:
Navigate to Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Network > Network Provider > Hardened UNC Paths
-Apply the following values:
\*SYSVOL  RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1  
\*NETLOGON  RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1  
-Run gpupdate /force and verify access controls.

	Number of Users Not in Protected Users

The Protected Users group enhances security by enforcing stricter authentication policies, preventing NTLM usage, and restricting credential caching. Users not in this group remain more susceptible to authentication-based attacks.

To mitigate this, privileged accounts should be added to the Protected Users group:
-Open Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
-Locate and modify the Protected Users group
-Add the necessary accounts and enforce a Group Policy update

Please let me know if you need any further clarification in implementing these changes.

Best regards,

Dear Atif,

Following up on our meeting, I am providing further details regarding the findings related to Hardened UNC Paths and Protected Users, along with the recommended mitigation steps.


	Hardened Paths Have Been Modified to Lower the Security Level


This finding indicates that the Hardened UNC Paths policy has been altered, reducing protection for SYSVOL and NETLOGON shares. This increases the risk of unauthorized access and potential manipulation of Group Policy settings.

-To mitigate this, the policy should be correctly enforced through Group Policy Management:
Navigate to Computer Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Network > Network Provider > Hardened UNC Paths
-Apply the following values:
\*SYSVOL  RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1  
\*NETLOGON  RequireMutualAuthentication=1, RequireIntegrity=1  
-Run gpupdate /force and verify access controls.


	Number of Users Not in Protected Users


The Protected Users group enhances security by enforcing stricter authentication policies, preventing NTLM usage, and restricting credential caching. Users not in this group remain more susceptible to authentication-based attacks.

To mitigate this, privileged accounts should be added to the Protected Users group:
-Open Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)
-Locate and modify the Protected Users group
-Add the necessary accounts and enforce a Group Policy update

Please let me know if you need any further clarification in implementing these changes.

Best regards,
Iulia Apatachioaei
Sr. Support Engineer

Dear Atif,

Thank you for reaching out regarding the risk identified by PingCastle related to ""Hardened Paths being modified to lower the security level.""

Ahead of our meeting, I’m sharing the relevant Microsoft support article  here . The section on ""Minimum recommended configuration for domain-joined computers"" provides guidance on properly securing Group Policy paths, which is the focus of PingCastle’s detection.

I am available to meet on Thursday between 10:00 AM CET and 6:00 PM CET. Please let me know the most suitable time for you.

Looking forward to your confirmation.
