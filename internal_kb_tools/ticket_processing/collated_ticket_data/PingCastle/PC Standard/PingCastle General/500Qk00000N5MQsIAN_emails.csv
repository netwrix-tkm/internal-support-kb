Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. I'm Rej and I'll be assisting you today.

We have reviewed the issue you reported regarding the PingCastle scan getting stuck at the ""Gathering GPO data"" step. Based on the trace log extracts, it appears that the connection between the server and the Domain Controller (DC) is being aborted or not responding within the default Windows timeout of one minute. This could potentially be an environmental issue, possibly related to firewall settings or new software being tested in your environment.

We recommend checking the following:


	Firewall Settings: Ensure that the necessary ports and protocols are open and not being blocked by any firewall rules.
	Network Stability: Verify the stability of the network connection between the server and the DC.
	Recent Changes: Review any recent changes or new software implementations that might be affecting the connection.


If the issue persists, please provide additional details or contact our support team for further assistance.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Hi Rej,

Thank you for your reply.


  1.  Do you have a list of ports PingCastle expects to be open? I know 9389 for ADWS and 389 for LDAP.
  2.  The network should be stable and I verified that there are no replication issues.
  3.  I looked at recent changes to domain controllers and there is nothing that should be causing this behaviour.

I have left PingCastle running again and it is still getting the same issue - always ""Gathering gpo data"". Is there any option to run PingCastle without checking the MSI files in each GPO, or to run it with an increased timeout period?

PingCastle requires several ports to be open for proper functionality. Here are the key ports:


	LDAP (tcp/389): Used for querying the Active Directory.
	ADWS (tcp/9389): Used for Active Directory Web Services.
	SMB (tcp/445): Used for file sharing and other network services.
	DNS (tcp/53): Used for domain name resolution.
	RPC (tcp/135): Used for remote procedure calls.


These ports ensure that PingCastle can communicate effectively with the domain controllers and other network services.

Please check these ports and have them open. Let me know if this fixes the issue.

Hi Rej,

Thank you for the response.

I am pleased to share that PingCastle is working again in our dev environment. I did some more digging based on the trace log and figured it was getting stuck checking some of the MSI files. There was a DFS path that was not disabled correctly and caused an extremely long response.

Hi Rej,

Thank you for the response.

I am pleased to share that PingCastle is working again in our dev environment. I did some more digging based on the trace log and figured it was getting stuck checking some of the MSI files. There was a DFS path that was not disabled correctly and caused an extremely long response.

Kind regards,

Hello Lachlan,

Thanks for your reply.

PingCastle requires several ports to be open for proper functionality. Here are the key ports:

  1.  LDAP (tcp/389): Used for querying the Active Directory.
  2.  ADWS (tcp/9389): Used for Active Directory Web Services.
  3.  SMB (tcp/445): Used for file sharing and other network services.
  4.  DNS (tcp/53): Used for domain name resolution.
  5.  RPC (tcp/135): Used for remote procedure calls.

These ports ensure that PingCastle can communicate effectively with the domain controllers and other network services.

Please check these ports and have them open. Let me know if this fixes the issue.

Thank you,

Rej Uddin

ref:_00D7091pB._500Q000N5MQs:ref


Hi Rej,

Thank you for your reply.


  1.  Do you have a list of ports PingCastle expects to be open? I know 9389 for ADWS and 389 for LDAP.
  2.  The network should be stable and I verified that there are no replication issues.
  3.  I looked at recent changes to domain controllers and there is nothing that should be causing this behaviour.

I have left PingCastle running again and it is still getting the same issue - always ""Gathering gpo data"". Is there any option to run PingCastle without checking the MSI files in each GPO, or to run it with an increased timeout period?

Kind regards,

Hello Lachlan,

Thank you for contacting Netwrix Technical Support. I'm Rej and I'll be assisting you today.

We have reviewed the issue you reported regarding the PingCastle scan getting stuck at the ""Gathering GPO data"" step. Based on the trace log extracts, it appears that the connection between the server and the Domain Controller (DC) is being aborted or not responding within the default Windows timeout of one minute. This could potentially be an environmental issue, possibly related to firewall settings or new software being tested in your environment.

We recommend checking the following:

  1.  Firewall Settings: Ensure that the necessary ports and protocols are open and not being blocked by any firewall rules.
  2.  Network Stability: Verify the stability of the network connection between the server and the DC.
  3.  Recent Changes: Review any recent changes or new software implementations that might be affecting the connection.

If the issue persists, please provide additional details or contact our support team for further assistance.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,
Rej Uddin
