My manager has given me a task to fix a script that runs PingCastle daily, which I have done. But I'm running into an issue with the license. In the history logs of the script, I can see that before the license renewal it ran as

""PingCastle Auditor license for USU Software AG""

But now after I updated the license key, it runs in free edition

""Free Edition of PingCastle 3.3.0 - Not for commercial use""

The license is applied in the <a href='https://PingCastle.exe.conf' target='_blank'>PingCastle.exe.conf</a> file as



And I have also tried running PingCastle with the --log argument, but I did not find any error related to licensing there.

I have also noticed that PingCastle has been acquired by Netwrix last year. So I was wondering if we need to download PingCastle again and reinstall it for it to work with the new license?

I also wanted to upload the license file, so you can check if it is valid, but I can't do it while creating the ticket. So I will do it after the creation if it is possible.

Could you please let us know if there is something we could try to push us forward in troubleshooting why the license is not being applied? Because at this point I'm lost since there are no errors or any messages telling me why it is failing.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Dominik Padych
