This should now be resolved. There were some issues on the web site due to some custom things we did with PingCastle Standard and then some funkiness because new files and file types broke something.

Please try again and let me know if it's working.

Good morning,

I just tried again, including after logging out and back in again, and by
opening an incognito window to make sure nothing was cached and I still get
the same error message. I also get an error if I try the link to download
the executable without the license embedded. See additional screenshot below

I can try again in a few minutes but so far it doesn't seem like the issue
has been resolved.

You will need to apply the license yourself after downloading the product. You can use your existing license.

For PingCastle Standard, you have to apply the license in pingcastle.exe.config file.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Good morning,

 

I just tried again, including after logging out and back in again, and by opening an incognito window to make sure nothing was cached and I still get the same error message. I also get an error if I try the link to download the executable without the license embedded. See additional screenshot below

 



I can try again in a few minutes but so far it doesn't seem like the issue has been resolved.

Hi Jonathan,

You will need to apply the license yourself after downloading the product. You can use your existing license.

For PingCastle Standard, you have to apply the license in pingcastle.exe.config file.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks, it seems to work now but I've lost access to the ""download the license"" option. Hopefully it's not an issue and the license is just baked into the executable.
