Anyway, hope you can help or direct me in the right direction.

Here is the question and below is a link to customer portal support article.

1. Is it possible to manage other users access to the license registered under my profile?
2. How do we associated the license to another profile in the customer portal?

It would be nice if we could manage this ourselves.
