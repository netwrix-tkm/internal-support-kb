My understanding is that the PingCastle Standard (formerly auditor) is licensed for a company, as indicated on the product page as well as included in the PingCastle reports. However, I appear to be the only one with access to the product page, with the possibility to download the latest version, and more importantly for our use case, the possibility to generate the temporary 48h licenses.

Is it possible to grant access to additional members of my team to the PingCastle license, and especially the ""Download 48H Assessment License"" button?

Thanks
Kind regards,
Thomas","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-05-21T14:50:14.000Z"
