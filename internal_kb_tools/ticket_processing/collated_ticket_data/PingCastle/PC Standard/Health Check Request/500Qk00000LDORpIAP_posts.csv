""RESTRICETEDTOUSER 
The permission described above is restricted to Users""
We cant find details on what this means on the ACL for the object, and when this legend appears the privilege mentioned is not seen on the ACL.
Can we get some clarification on why this legend appears and how we can see it on the ACL of the object?","","","","0054u000008ARZjAAO","2025-01-29T14:19:32.000Z"
