How do I update the license for PingCastle. We (not me) have already purchase a new license - got the license, but how do I update the expired license for the MY Products on My Profile (login)?

According to the below link, I just click the Licenses tab and update the license. Where do I find the update tab? It is not available under My Products tab.

I can only renew the license, not update.
